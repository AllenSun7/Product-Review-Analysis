5.0,"October 18, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Pros: • This is a solid built machine. Very sturdy and no dust cracks, while retaining its simple form. One of the few times I can say you’re getting exactly what every picture on the web is showing. • I had the basic black design, but I do appreciate that Amazon is offering more colors rather than there basic set (even if it’s only a few generic colors). • The mute option is the most appreciative tool. When you activate it the classic blue glow will fall into the red, giving you the visual display that your privacy is being protected. • The sound performs exactly what it’s built for. I found no issue in testing in an open living room. The volume goes to great levels as once again, for a 360-degree smart speaker, Amazon reigns supreme. • Testing all ranges of music, I found that that bass to be rich and powerful. My colleague has the previous Echo Plus and she states that there is an improvement in the bass with this Echo. An overall rich sound when a piano came in and a warmer outcome when acoustics came into play (You’ll get the bass experience when you hit those hard beats). • Like any other model, the Bluetooth connectivity between a third party stereo works flawlessly. I tested this out with some Bose surround sound, and nothing but clear music. You can also pair the Echo if you have smaller / weaker speakers. Both together will pump up the experience. • The connectivity is so flawless that buying two of these devices (or use Echo’s previous versions, if you have one) and put them in separate locations doesn’t make this a bad idea. You’re going to get great quality in music without paying an am or a leg for it. • I have to appreciate Amazon for not pushing their music platform. They offer the usual Spotify (which I used) but also Apple Music, Deezer, TuneIn, even BBC sounds. You’re getting a lot more features than just a basic smart speaker. • Using Google Home for over a year I can say that just saying “Alexa” felt more natural than saying “Ok Google.” Not to mention having Alexa listen to me every time I said: “Alexa” (Google Home users will understand this). • Like before, smart applications fit like a glove in this system. I only used it for lights and the Echo was spot on. This feature is more common than ever on any smart speaker, and the Echo does what it’s supposed to do. • I admire the organization of the app because it’s your remote control on anything you want the Echo to do. Turn off lights, switch music, mute volume, install new features, and so forth. We all carry our phones like carrying our driver licenses when going outside. This day in age I’ll always prefer an app than a physical remote. • I did some Alexa calls on this and found only clear responses and answers (this will depend on your Wi-Fi). • I would give 70% of Alexa sounding more human. • Everything is in the cloud so, you don’t need to worry about manual updates. All taken care of. • As I mentioned before, everything else is the same in a smart speaker. Ask for the weather, traffic, upcoming appointments, and all other general questions. I didn’t test all of them because…well is the same technology as last year. • The biggest difference in my book is the price. Newer and cheaper. Cons and Oks: • No Zigbee controller. This isn’t much of an issue, but if you already have a smart house layout than you’ll need to spend some extra time configuring with the Echo. The issue for this is that it puts more work on the Echo than you need. Also, there may be some smart devices that won’t work on the Echo because of this. I know last year's models had some connectivity issues with Philips Hue bulbs. Keep an eye out for which smart devices are compatible with the Echo. • I did notice that the app slows down when you put a lot of apps and smart applications in the Echos. I tested a lot of features out that require a decent amount of downloads, but the results did create a delay in the app. I have to assume without Zigbee’s software, if you have a lot of smart applications connected to the Echo, and with the general apps you use, there will be a delay in the long run. • The Echo gets loud. Loud enough that you’ll get some distortion when you’re around 95% in volume. The effect is shown when a lot of bass is begin made. Please note that 90% and up is booming your entire house. • Compare to Google Home, Alexa still isn’t the brightest smart speak in the family. For the basic day to day task it works fine, but those random questions that we tend to have throughout the day Alexa doesn’t deliver. Alexa will usually provide you with a quick one-sentence summary (Unlike Google, it would provide you a short paragraph.). This issue doesn’t happen all the time, but you’ll notice it when it does. • I’m trying to learn Spanish, so asking smile Spanish questions with Alexa is not reliable. Example I will say “Alexa, what does “Qué estás haciendo” in Spanish mean (What are you doing?)? Alexa will say “What are you happy.” I’ve been studying for 6 moths so my speech on that sentence was spot on, but Alexa. Not a reliable study buddy. • I had the first version of the Echo and all I can say is I miss the rotation ring. Bring it back Amazon. • The design is nothing new. It’s built very solid, but it’s identical to Echo Plus 2. My colleague had the Echo Plus and putting them aside there was no way you can tell the difference (a nice note if you want to steal your friends and replace it with the last version). • Even the sound is almost similar to the previous Echo. Both are fantastic, but almost the same. Bottom Line: It’s a great smart speaker system, but almost identical in every way as its previous model. There is nothing wrong with that because Amazon does put in a lot of features into this Echo that makes this right in the top three (Google Home, HomePods, and the Echo Family). It’s accurate, excellent sound, and lower in price than its previous model. Some concerns are the effects in the long run with those who have a decent amount of smart applications, and making sure the compatibility can be performed accurately. Also knowing the limits of what Alexa can and can’t do as the hardware is identical to its previous version. I wouldn’t be surprised if you want to just read Echo’s previous model amazon reviews. Trust me when I say that they’re almost identical in sight and performance. In the end, the reason it doesn’t matter about the flaws is because the price is well worth what you’re getting. It’s a machine that I can see using it every day for the simplest things such as setting up an alarm to enjoying it in small parties. I will say that if you’re planning to use your surround sound stereo connected to this, then this is a must buy. You pay a heavy price for a HomePod, enjoy a generic performance for a Google Home, and are presented with an overall user-friendly experience with the Echo 3. Cheaper than its predecessor and the worth every penny. Overall: A tiny upgrade from its previous model, but still an excellent experience in sound for all. Hope I was a help to you. Love, Honest Reviewer"
5.0,"October 21, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I purchased my first Alexa Echo 1st Gen two years ago and I fell in love right away! It was bittersweet for me to replace it with the newer 3rd Gen but they had an amazing trade-in offer so I had to take advantage of it. First thing to note this Echo is much shorter than Gen 1 but a little wider which I prefer because it looks and fits better on my kitchen island. The new blue color is amazing if you’re considering getting it! Setting up the new Echo was the easiest most seamless process! I literally took it out of the box, plugged it in and in under a minute it set itself up and was ready to use! I didn’t have to do anything, it was already programmed with my smart lights and my WiFi, couldn’t ask for an easier setup. I love my Echo and use it every day and if you’re considering getting one, I say go for it! If I had to critique or complain about anything the only thing I could say is the wall adapter is really large since it’s still a square block like Gen 1.  This is more of a personal opinion but Gen 1 had a rotating top to turn the volume up and down (which I loved) where as Gen 3 has volume up and down buttons. Functionally they both work I just though the rotating volume top was more fun and unique, but I’ll live on just fine with the buttons."
5.0,"November 11, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"This is my first time purchasing an Echo Alexa of my own. I’ve used an Alexa 2nd Gen at my job and it’s pretty nice. I noticed the difference between the 2nd and 3rd Gen is that the 3rd Gen speaker is way louder and clear and I like that. I’m still playing with it and getting used to it but I do LOVE the Twilight Blue. That’s a sexy color to be honest lol. So far, I’m impressed with it."
1.0,"October 25, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I bought an Echo and an Echo Dot. What a waste of money. They're basic; real basic. My fault for not truly understanding what I was buying. It can answer some simple questions with simple answers and do a few smart home things and has ""skills"" but that's about it. Isn't that enough? No, it isn't. I guess I thought I was getting something smart, something I could engage with, seek intelligent replies from, something connected to the world wide web of knowledge. Guess I was wrong. I got a stupid little automated squawk box; a borderline parrot. Guess I got bought. For all our great advances in technology, we're clearly still in our technological infancy. Get back to me when I can say ""Computer, describe to me quantum physics in layman's terms. Explain to me the theory of relativity. What exactly is gravity; are there gravity particles? What is the meaning of life?"" The answer to the latter better be: 42. Another big gripe is that it's constantly trying to sell me something -running through a whole dales pitch -instead of just doing or playing what I asked, or it tells me what it's about to do even though I just asked it exactly that. Now I know why it's called, Echo. I'll be getting rid of it soon. Anybody wanna buy a stupid, smart device?"
5.0,"October 26, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"This is by far, the best Echo / system we have owned from Amazon. We purchased 2 of the generation 3 Echos and an Amazon sub as a package (saved $80 + an additional $60 for taking the Amazon store card) to replace the Bose speaker / Echo Dot we had. We now have room filling sound as good as the Bose combo without having to physically turn on the speaker every time we wanted music. Even without the sub, the sound is robust and rich from each of the linked speakers.  The addition of the powered Echo sub fills in the lows to make it an immersive experience. Setup was fairly easy.  My only complaint was that I had trouble renaming the 2nd Echo itself.  Amazon keeps calling it another wacky name.  Overall, it took less than 5 minutes to link all 3 speakers together and be listening. Would I purchase again?  You can count on it."

5.0,"October 22, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo," He recibido mi nuevo Echo, y lo he configurado con los otros equipos, y ahora tengo un excelente ambiente musical, además de todas los beneficios anexos. Excelente adquisición"
5.0,"October 18, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,"I’ve been waiting for the next generation for some time. I got one of these for when I’m in my hot tub and is perfect to sit on the patio and have great sound. Easy setup, great response time, the sound is fantastic!"
5.0,"December 2, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I don't want to hear from audiophiles talk about how this doesn't have the range or response of blah blah blah.  Please don't listen to those people either simply because if they were so expert, their ears SO sensitive to precise megahertz and bass/treble/midrange ratios...why are they wasting time on a $79 speaker?? The fact is, for 99.9% of us, us who have listened to and loved music our whole lives, these things are AMAZING.  Not only the sound quality which is as good or better than anything out there for twice the price, but for the convenience of being able to call up any song by speaking your request. How does this compare to Bose or Sonos?  Who cares, both of those are more expensive, can't be easier to setup (especially Sonos - which started out with great app function but went completely off the rails) and can't be easier to use.  You can't regret buying these things, and couples with the subwoofer, you'll be in da club..."

5.0,"November 11, 2019",Sandstone,Echo,Always a fan of the echo family and the sound on this one is wonderful. Great for a room and connected via Bluetooth for computer speaker.
5.0,"October 21, 2019",Sandstone,Echo,"This Echo sounds incredible! I play all my units together, this one and two regular size Echo dots and they all seem to pick up the sound from this one. The regular Echo dots sound kind of tinny to me. Love it!"
1.0,"October 27, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"None of the apps sync with the speaker, even if you have the subscription to the music service it just takes you to the settings and says you need an active subscription. There are 100+ negative reviews everyday in the Alexa app about people experiencing the same thing. IF YOU HAVE AN IPHONE THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE THE APP WILL NOT WORK PROPERLY!"
4.0,"November 14, 2019",Sandstone,Echo,"This is a big upgrade in sound over the Echo dot.  While we use it often in our kitchen, know that it is not high end quality sound - what do you expect from one small speaker.  It is plenty good enough for an enjoyable listening experience, especially for background music while working/cooking.  In comparison, the Echo dot sound was just too poor quality to enjoy without hooking up an auxiliary speaker and so we only used it occasionally.  I was surprised that this new unit defaults to Amazon Music rather than Prime music and so we started getting commercials mixed in to our music stream.  It takes time to get the commands right to connect to Prime music without commercials - not an issue we had with the Echo dot that this unit replaced."
5.0,"October 31, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,I bought this as an upgrade from my echo 2nd gen. I use it in my bathroom so I can listen to music. It took me by surprise when it made the shower floor rattle a bit. Overall great product. UPDATE Apparently the new echo didnt like sharing the pedestal with my ceramic bird like my old echo did. Why do I say this? It shook it right off! Overall still a great product.
5.0,"October 18, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Set-up took all of 30 seconds.Great,customizable sound. Good bass for rock;good overall sound for classical. Looks nice,too! I hope that,in the near future,I can pair my  DOT,3rd gen for even more immersive sound. Overall,very pleased!!!"
1.0,"December 4, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"We got this and was very excited to use it.  However it would not connect.  We tried every way possible.  We tried it thru the app on the phone, thru an amazon tablet, thru a Microsoft surface.  Nothing would work.  We called support.  They needed access to our computer, so I allowed it.  They did all kinds of stuff but not once did they try to connect the device.  I could see everything they were doing.  They had us putting in passwords to the connection etc.. They said our network was at risk etc.  then they tried to sell us stuff. This is the number that was given when it said to call support immediately by the way.  So after we got off the phone with support, we run a scan and all of the sudden our network is not safe....go figure.  My husband is very tech savy and he was quite sure they did something especially since they tried us to buy software to ""fix our network"" and never once tried to connect to the device.  So we had to fix that and then do a factory reset on all of our devices.  I even looked online and tried other option such as rebooting the modem, the router, the echo.  ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WORKED.  The phone we tried to use is a Samsung S10 PLus. I DO NOT RECOMMED THIS PRODUCT!"
5.0,"October 20, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I suppose most people are wondering the obvious? Does it have any new features? Does it go well with your decor? Can you order a pizza and in fact, have Alexa pay for it? OK, that one I haven't tried yet... but I will tell you that it is an upgrade, looks sleeker than older versions, and the sound packs a  punch! Some services like apple music are atrocious! The service doesn't stay connected, and it's hardly useable. I venture to guess that this issue is fixable but this far is a letdown. If you're looking for a smart assistant that is extremely useful and always works... look no further! You won't regret it!"
5.0,"November 25, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I have tried Alexa and I have tried the G word and the A word out performs the G word any day. I lost connection over and over with the G word and so far after more than a month, I have never lost connection with Miss Alexa so I am very happy and being a prime member And being able to pay for it monthly you just can’t beat that so thank you Amazon you will have a prime member as long as I’m around. The bass quality is awesome....the sound quality, and if you don’t know the difference i’m sorry, is awesome and me being an audiophile I don’t use The word awesome lightly. You can’t go wrong with Miss Alexa."
5.0,"November 6, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I like this better than my Sonos system with Alexa. You can pair Echos to play throughout your home, and it's easier than trying to setup my Sonos to do the same. You can control the Echo via voice, Alexa app, or through the Amazon Music app. All of these are leaps better than the buggy Sonos app. The sound quality is fantastic and the value for your money is higher than any competitor. I do believe I will be purchasing Amazon Echos from here on out."
1.0,"November 6, 2019",Sandstone,Echo,"Why does my gen2 Alexa have blue tooth, but this new gen3 doesn’t?  If blue tooth doesn’t work, it’s likely I’m sending it back and not buying anymore echo products.  I don’t read anywhere that clearly says we took blue tooth away.  It says it’s the same thing just a few enhancements to speakers and such."
5.0,"October 18, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Just set up the new Echo 3rd generation and alexa is very responsive, great sound quality, and you can easily connect other premium services. Just trying to figure out how to connect Netflix."
5.0,"November 9, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Great so far (2 weeks). I bought it for my elderly aunt (94 years old) and she loves it since she just talks to it and it turns on the radio and she has someone to talk to in the morning. The only problem is she keeps calling her ""Alexis"" instead of ""Alexa"" ... lol. But she is finally getting the name right. Overall, it works great. She keeps the volume up rather high which is why I bought the Echo instead of the smaller one and the sound is great. We'll see who lasts longer."
5.0,"December 1, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I am very disappointed in this. I have been using the Echo Dot for a month and thought I would come up with the perfect anniversary gift for our 30th. The Echo is muffled and is absolutely not worth the 70 dollar price difference. On top of that it goes on sale $40 less than what I paid to add insult to injury. Because it was over 7 days I could not get a price adjustment. Should have had our anniversary a couple weeks sooner! People at work are waiting for my feedback to see if they should go with one of these and I can say with full confidence they need to pass on this one. Update: 20 minutes after I posted this review my phone rang and it was a wonderful person from Amazon by the name of Kristina. She apologized for my experience and showed me how to adjust the bass, treble and midrange to give me the sound the device was meant to put out. She also arranged for me to return the Echo and buy another one to get the sale price. This is the gold standard of customer service that other businesses should strive for.  Thank you for caring!"
4.0,"December 18, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Overall I love this product. Comparable sound quality to other similar priced and size products (JBL Pulse). The main issue for me is I already had a 3rd gen dot. I specifically wanted to buy another Echo product to pair for stereo and have some bass. Originally, I was going to get another dot and the sub. However I grabbed this Echo when it was on sale $60! The sub seems overpriced so I had hoped this would pair with the dot and give me the low end that I needed. I searched everywhere to see if an Echo and a dot would pair and could not find an answer! I had hoped that since both were the newest generation they would pair. NOPE! One workaround, you can play both simultaneously in the same room if you setup multiroom sound. However, the two will still not be stereo which pisses me off. AMAZON please fix this glitch. Why on earth can you not pair ANY two Echo products? Especially the same generation models? So can a Echo and an Echo+ not be paired either?"
3.0,"December 2, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"We're an Alexa household, with an Echo speaker in almost every room, not to mention our smart plugs, bulbs, and such. So we're in it for the long haul. We went to upgrade our final Echo Dot to a full-fledged Echo. This was our first 3rd Gen (our 2nd Gen Echos are wonderful, so we figured, the 3rd Gen must be even better). The sound quality and ease of setup was second-to-none (comparable to 2nd Gen - no marked improvement - probably given that the 2nd Gen is about perfect). HOWEVER, we stream a lot of music in our home. And Echo usually does a flawless job at it, even syncing across devices. However, one small (arguably nitpicky) problem with this 3rd Gen unit. When you wake this unit while music is playing, it pauses the music as expected to listen to your command; however, after pausing it also sounds a momentary crackle/pop (and by momentary, a teeny-tiny fraction of a second). You start talking to it and it pops. Just enough, however, to drive you mad. And frankly, it's just not acceptable. Not when our other units work perfectly. I contact tech support, and they said that they were able to replicate it, and that it was ""completely normal."" Well, I'm a reasonable person, but this just kind of cheapens the experience, and frankly I'm not convinced it is normal behavior (by the way, we restarted it/reset it/upgraded it/basically everything to try and rectify). And maybe this wouldn't be an issue for most (the speaker is wonderful otherwise), but we use our Echos heavily, often interrupting the music to turn on lights, for example, and I just don't want to hear it pop and crackle when I'm talking to it."
5.0,"October 19, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I mainly use this Alexa as a speaker for my music. The sound quality on this Alexa is better than on the previous Alexa in my opinion. It's super easy to set up and use. I often change the location of my Alexa as well because as I said I mainly use it as a speaker.  It does really well if you need to unplug it and and plug it in in another location (as in it'll connect to the wifi on it's own and you can use it as you normally would without any hassle). I got the charcoal color and it's very nice visually. The Alexa app is also very convenient to use with it. You can personalize the sound of the bass and other mixes too. Overall, I say it's a really nice product. The packaging was super nice and felt high quality as well. No problems with shipping too."
5.0,"December 1, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"having had the 1st gen since the first invite, decided to make the upgrade when the 3rd gen went on sale.  traded in the 1st gen and ended up paying about $20 for the 3rd gen. 3rd gen is lighter by about 10oz but significantly wider and shorter (36oz 1st gen / 26 oz 3rd gen) than the 1st gen.  hooked it up and music seems to have better bass.  made some adjustments in the eq in alexa app and it does sound clearer compared to the 1st gen.  no issues with sound quality. the most significant upgrade imo is the improvement in mic.  the 3rd gen is much more sensitive to the wake word even while blasting music.  1st gen would sometimes miss the wake word even during silence and good luck trying to wake it while blasting music.  3rd gen has no issues waking even when blasting music.  the only thing it doesn't have is the ring to adjust the volume and i thought i would miss that but not at all.  it has the buttons now but rarely use it anyway since the mic sensitivity is now so much improved.  all in all a no brainer especially after sale price and trade in."
1.0,"December 9, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"For each Echo purchased it was supposed to come with an echo dot.  I bought two echo's and should have received two echo dots but I only got one echo dot.  The 2 echos and the 2 echo dots showed during my order and even after, now the second one is missing. I am trying to find a place to call in and talk about this issue and no where can I find anything but here.  This is very frustrating as they are gifts for my kids. And now I am trying to decide if I will be sending the second one back. The echo works great.  I am just disappointed that this second echo dot has disappeared from my order and shipment."

1.0,"December 12, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,"The sound quality sounds so cheap and overly bassy. There is a much longer delay when requesting Alexa perform any actions. I also have to repeat requests sometime several times for any action to take place. Several times I'll request something and Alexa repeats a completely random request instead. I regret opting-in on the trade-in offer as I prefer my ""old"" Gen 2 devices, which were accepted at a greatly reduced amount. The tech support offered me nothing as they don't seem to know about their own products. It is not giftable as I don't believe it's a good product."

5.0,"November 15, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I have every generation Echo and love them all. One broke only because I dropped it on a granite floor. Other drops have not harmed them. I am not an audiophile, but the sound on this is satisfying for the way I listen. Volume range is great. I listen to pop and rock a great deal, nature sounds for sleeping, and right now some opera arias. I am happy with all of them. The new look is wonderful. I like that it is shorter and wider. More stable on a shelf or table. I do a great deal of house sitting and take many of my own things with me. This is getting packed in that travel bag! The only negative I find is that the fabric cover somewhat covers the light ring on top, and the light seems less bright. Now how do I convince my husband that I need another at home with one in my bedroom and three Dots around the house?"
5.0,"December 3, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"This is my first Alexa speaker, but i've been streaming music for years though various moderately high-end computer speakers and a large selection of bluetooth speakers - everything from cheapies to a 50 watt guitar amp with bluetooth. I'm not an audiophile, but I do like my music to sound good - which, to me, means balanced, not bass-heavy, with good clarity and a high end that doesn't become strident at higher volumes. I bought three of these to have at different locations around the house.  Setup was super simple, d/l the app and sign in to your Amazon account and you're up and running.  No issues at all. Here's what I love so far:  Alexa is super easy to get along with...Alexa, with whom I get along easily...?...has been a treat.  I've been an Amazon music user for a few years now.  I like the selection but using the app on a phone or tablet is a frustrating experience, and it can also be super clunky and slow on a PC, as well. With this speaker I can ask Alexa to play a song, album or playlist and it's playing within moments.  Awesome!  Also, Alexa gave me a detailed, accurate weather forecast this morning.  Nice!  I haven't explored all the features, but I primarily want these for music. And as far as that goes, the sound quality is better than I expected, and I've got no complaints.  I have one speaker on top of my fridge in the kitchen and the sound is just amazing.  Balanced and clear with more than enough bass.  I listened to some jazz, some alt-country, some reggae and some ambient music.  They all sounded great - as good as I could hope for. And Alexa heard me from the next room without a problem. These speakers are well worth their price, and at the Black Friday price they're an incredible value.  These speakers have  removed my Amazon Music frustration (or a large chunk of them, anyway) and allowed me much better access to what I'm paying for."
4.0,"December 6, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"We only owned a single 2nd gen dot and 2 3rd gen dots. I saw the echo 3rd gen was new and on sale during Black Friday weekend for $60, so I grabbed one. We wanted another echo dot but after reading and watching reviews I decided to spend a bit more and go with a full blown echo. The echo dot 3rd gens are amazing. They really are. For $22 on sale they are especially a no brainer. The sound quality is night and day compared to the 1st and 2nd gen dot. Like twice as good regarding sound quality and fullness and how loud it can get. Alarms will actually wake you. After watching some reviews of the new big echo here, I was sold. Now and then we use the living room echo for some music while we clean or to just goof off and dance like idiots lol. While the dot did good, why not go fuller and louder with the big echo? Well, it’s still an amazing unit. Does all the dot does, of course. However, while the sound is fuller and louder, it’s not going to blow you away. I guess maybe I overhyped it based on the reviews I saw and their reactions, but I was a bit bummed. Yes, absolutely it’s louder...my totally unscientific measurement would be it’s like....15-20% louder and fuller sounding (deep, more bass, higher highs etc). I’m not sure what I was expecting. Maybe I’d be happier regarding sound with the “studio” version? I don’t know. I don’t regret the purchase, though. The extra volume is welcome and it definitely does sound better with music. Happy but I believe I overhyped. If I had the money, I’d def replace the dots with the full echos. Only pluses and no negatives other than being less amazing as I had made it in my own head."
1.0,"November 7, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"This device did not work. Can not connect to wifi, which makes it an expensive paper weight. We own at 6 other similar devices. Will be returning and purchasing again, but from Best Buy where I'll not only get a functioning device, but I can collect points. The price is also the same."
1.0,"December 6, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Incredibly disappointed. This was one of EIGHT Fire TV and/or Echo devices that I purchased on Black Friday, hoping to switch from Roku TV and have a seamless smarthome experience. Oh boy, was I wrong. Whether I rename the the Fire TV devices or use their original names, the echo devices CANNOT control or recognize the tv devices, even after properly pairing them under the TV & Video setting in the Alexa app. I've tried to unpair, repair, restart, unregister, reregister, you name it. I've wasted days.  Generally, Alexa responds with 'I cannot find a device named ...' I consider myself very technically savy and I'm positive this is not something that I'm doing wrong. I should've read more into this before buying. TONS of people all over the internet are having this problem. It's infuriating. Plain and simple, until problems like this are fixed, Amazon is blaintantly false advertising the way that their devices work. Other cons to note: -Multiple video apps stutter and sometimes even randomly pause without ever resuming unless you physically resume them. -Alexa drastically lowers the volume of the TV when you are voicing a command. This in-and-of-itself is not a huge problem. However, it becomes a problem often when after the command is complete, Alexa does not resume the original volume of the content. When this has happened, I've had to ask Alexa to turn the volume back up to the specific number it was at. -I have two third generation echos paired as a stereo system for the TV. Often, even though I have my fire TV set as the preferred device, only the echos hear my voice, and once again, because they cannot control the TV, they say that they cannot recognize the device and then I just have to pick up the controller anyway. -The Fire TV will often think that it hears an 'Alexa' when absolutely no where near that word has been stated. Because the volume lowers drastically when Alexa is listening, it creates an obnoxious volume dip in content to listen for nothing when this happens. -You cannot set a sleep timer Honestly I could go on and on about the cons and about just how unhappy I am about these products. There are even more problems than what I listed here, but I'm not wasting too much breath, as after doing days and days of research on these topics, I've seen that Amazon has absolutely no answers to these problems, even after thousands of people have reported the same problems over and over. Unless there is some revalatory software updated coming, I'll be returning hundreds of dollars of equipment."
5.0,"October 30, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"The sound on the Echo 3rd Gen is amazing!  We upgraded from the 1st Gen and you can clearly hear a deeper base and sound that fills the room.  We liked the different colors and twilight blue didn't disappoint.  The speaker is shorter and wider than the 1st Gen but that is a welcome change.  From a functionality standpoint, I don't see any difference from earlier gen echo devices as they can all answer questions, set timers, update lists, play music or trivia and turn on and off smart devices if you already had a hub such as Philips or Smart Things.  The 3rd Gen does not have its own hub but that was fine for us.  Overall we love the 3rd Gen Echo and highly recommend if you are looking to upgrade from previous gen or if you're in the market as a fist time Alexa Echo purchaser."
3.0,"November 11, 2019",Sandstone,Echo,Overall it's the best in its class persay. But It always seems to go offline and wont play or listen to what i ask. I had way less trouble with second gen... it has a harder time staying in everywhere music mode.. so I would say save your money and advise echo.. to fix the basics before ya out more bells and whistles in something that ain't already working well!!!
2.0,"November 7, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"As an early adopter for Echo v1, I thought now would be a good time to see what kind of improvements Amazon has made to their Alexa platform. I also have Dots in each of my kids room, a fire stick, and a fire 8 tablet. I don't feel this new generation has done anything to make it a better product, other than a great blue color. I feel my first gen sounded better than this one. I actually just moved it to a spare family room downstairs and hooked up my Google Mini again. Meh."
3.0,"December 31, 2019",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"I am glad that it was purchased during a Black Friday Sale,  making it more affordable. However, having listened to music through so many, othwr, older models, much taller(larger?) Echo(s) , Ive been  expecting at least the same high-quality sound, if not better,  with an upgraded 2019, model.  is it me ir does size count?  Being at least  1/3  shorter than Echos I listen to elsewhere, on a regular basis, HOLD-UP, WAIT: Apologies for typis I cannot control nor change, thanks to yhis Refurbed 2017 Fire Tablet 10 sent last Oct. 2019, replacing the defective, albeit brand- new- identical model (a Regift from friend in  Jan. 2019).  Back to the topic, i am not very impressed, therefore, unsure of our futurevtogether. This is  my first, Echo and so far: Alexis has been  unable to find most of the songs I requested, some genres escape her (Gospel). The sound is over- Bassy,  tinny Treble,  I akready own a larger size Bose System in living room.  This is on 2nd Fl. in Office/Den.  I expected more sound, less failed Alexis, .I'll need to find more electrical outlets. For some reason, I believed that this upgraded model would be wireless (my fault and not a deal- breaker).  Being an audiophile , if its not wowing me, not keeping more electronics around attracting more electric dust.  The good news is that no one is evesdropping, not hacked, yet, simply bc it will not  function on any power strip not even our new, free,  eversource/Nstar Advanced Power Strip, unless plugged into a Hot/Control Socket.  Huh.Control mode? Nope, notgunnahappen.

1.0,"November 30, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Took the plunge seeing as it was only $59. The Alexa app freezes during set up. Couldn’t get the aux to “in”. It’s now bricked, stuck with a constant blue circle and can’t reset it. Amazon gets confused when I have accounts in Japan and the UK in addition to the US and kindly talks Japanese."
2.0,"December 11, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Honestly, I thought I got better sound performance from my Gen1 echo than this one. My old one broke and the program to trade in plus black Friday made this a good deal so hard to complain too much. Overall I would NOT call this a premium product. It's passable and the interface with other smart home products is good but it sort of feels like Amazon is cheaping out on the product now that consumer adoption is near saturation. Basically a bait and switch from Amazon; initial model is high quality to attract customers and once you have them, bring out a cheaper model. Pros - easy to setup, even for those who aren't tech savvy - interfaces with other smart products well - good deal on sale - great gift if someone doesn't have Meh - app is not as controllable as I would like - voice recognition is ok. Basic commands are flawless but anything more is beyond its capabilities Cons - speaker sound quality - asking questions gives irrelevant responses - media player in app kinda sucks to control. For example, switching from one speaker to multiple room is a little challenging in app once the music is playing I felt the same way about the echo auto. Not well engineered, just forced a product out and people are left disappointed with the results. Won't be purchasing again once this one breaks."
5.0,"December 13, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I love this. I use it mostly for music, alarms and ordering from Amazon. So many more possibilities but I use the apps for my security cams. I have an iPad so I see no need for the show me feature. But if you have a lousy,  slow, ring app, I think that would be the hot shot.  I tore the ring doorbell out with my bare hands I was so pissed. By the time you open the app everything that was going to happen has already happened whoever was at the door is already gone. By the time the app opens, everything that was going to happen has already happened. So the show me feature has got to be quicker than the ring app and would be a nice addition to alexa. Then I’ve connected “the dots”.. I wondered why they call them dots, now it all makes sense. I use the dots for stereo sound in my home. They all work the same as Echo. You don’t need Echo to have the dots either. Dots are smaller so the speaker is smaller, that’s all. Great for smaller rooms and still have a good quality speaker. Better privacy controls on these. You can turn off the speaker manually and if you want delete everything you said that day you can do that too. Ask Alexa to do it for you. Decent app. Play with the settings. Good deal all around."
2.0,"December 9, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I'm in complete shock that Amazon has failed to provide a platform in the Amazon Alexa app to choose specific days for morning alarms. Something so trivial and simple as that has not been designed yet. I just got off the phone. They're going to forward it to somebody higher. Can you believe this? You can choose X days of the week with reminders but not with daily alarms. So this means that my son who works Monday through Saturday and is only off on Sunday has to be woken up on Sunday morning in order to be woken up Monday through Saturday or unplug the device on Saturday night. Can you believe that? I'm sorry but my mind is absolutely blown that these people who want to be leaders of every technical thing in the world and the shopping leaders of the world have dropped the ball so ridiculously in this department. Like I said, still in utter shock and I have five of these devices in my house. I have dedicated over two hours of my day to this matter and I feel like putting all five devices in the drive and driving over them repeatedly with my car. And I mean repeatedly. Wherever mr. Bezos is... You dropped the ball"
3.0,"January 16, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"I bought two identical Echoes, 3rd generation, verified purchaser.  I installed one in the den and one in the master bedroom.  I also installed 4 Alexa compatible security devices in those two rooms.  The Echo were set up for Apple I-Tunes.  After a week, the Echo in the bedroom worked flawlessly.  The Echo in the den would constantly tell me that “Apple Music is not supported by this device.”  The next time I tried the same command, the Echo would work.  I never got this message on the Echo in the bedroom.  I uninstalled and installed Apple Music Twice.  It worked flawlessly for a couple of days, and then it went berserk again on the Echo in the den.  As an engineer, I decided that I would run a totally controlled experiment with the response of the Echo as the only variable.  I recorded several voice bytes with the exact same Alexa command of “Alexa Using Apple Music Play Willie Nelson Seven Spanish Angels.”  All of the recordings had 10 seconds of silence at the beginning before it gave the “Alexa” command.  I chose a specific sound byte that had properly worked twice in a row.  I placed the recorder on the arm of the recliner that I usually sit.  I had access to a sound meter calibrated and certified for regulatory noise compliance regulations on all governmental levels.  The noise meter was last calibrated in November 2019.  The certification is valid for 12 months.  I placed the microphone of the noise meter within 2 inches of the Echo.  I played the same sound byte 20 times without changing either the location or volume level of the recorder.  The plots of what was received on the sound meter could be plotted, and all 20 plots were a perfect overlay.  With scientific certainty, the Echo was receiving the exact same sound byte 20 times in a row without the slightest variation in sound level or voice intonation.  The results: 8 times the Echo told me that Apple Music was not supported by this device, 6 times the Echo interrupted the sound byte and started playing unsolicited music and 6 times the Echo played the requested song via the requested source.  Again, I could verify and certify that the Echo was receiving the precise same sound byte every time.  I then took the recorder into the bedroom and played the sound byte 20 times there.  The distance was about 3 times further away than in the den.  The results, the Echo played the correct song 20 times in a row.  There is obviously an issue with the quality control with this device.  I got a good one, and I got a turkey.  It’s a roll of the dice on what you are going to get."
4.0,"November 14, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"This speaker, after the Gen 2 echo, didn't blow my socks off.  It sounds great, but then my gen 2 sounded very good also.  I also have a pair of gen 2's grouped as a stereo pair, grouped also with an Echo Sub.  I wouldn't even consider replacing those Gen 2's with Gen 3's.  With the Sub doing a bunch of the system's work, the system sounds great to me already.  So if you're buying new, get the Gen 3 for sure (not a used or refurbed set of Gen 2s)  If you have Gen 2s, you probably should keep them.  Unless you are a toy boy like me!"
5.0,"January 10, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I purchased it mainly for music since I don't have a stereo in my home other than a small boombox, which I don't use because it doesn't sound all that great. But I have to say that Echo sounds better audio quality than the portable radio. I have hearing loss due to an accident years ago, so I really shouldn't be rating sound quality, it is difficult for me to hear some tones. The Alexa app on my Android phone has a simple EQ. While it does help, it's not sensitive enough to compensate for my poor hearing. Even so, I can hear good enough to enjoy music on my Echo, which is linked in a special group with two Echo Dot devices in separate rooms. I can walk around the house and have music wherever I go. This is an awesome feature. I've learned to use it for weather and news reports as well as set reminders, timers, and lists. Plus I have some fun askingng Alexa to play Star Trek sounds and other cool stuff. I also set Alexa to ""away"" mode when I leave the house and she listens for common noises like glass breaking and will alert me if she hears anything suspicious. She's definitely not a security device. But it's nice to know she's got an ear for possible intruders and will let me know. A great feature is the relaxing music or pleasing sounds that I play when going to sleep. I especially like the ocean waves for sleeping. One issue I've experienced, Echo and Echo Dot become unresponsive once in a while. I have to unplug and reconnect power to reinitialize functionality. I'm not sure what's causing this problem? It could be my network/WiFi signal or some other problem technical problem so I can't ding Echo for the issue just yet. Luckily the issue is random and infrequent. I'm still discovering new features. I never thought I'd say this, but Alexa with Echo has enhanced the enjoyment of my home. In all, I love my Echo."
2.0,"December 2, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Speaker sounds great when it works.  There was one instance (in the 3 days it’s been operational) when the highs sounded distorted during music playback, like the speaker was blown.  When testing with Alexa, her voice had an apparent ’lisp’ when responding to prompts.  A quick unplug and replug seemed to take care of the problem; but it’s unknown when the issue will occurrence again.  Returning and reordering while the device is still on sale.  Giving one as a gift and worried about the functionality for recipients that are not as technically inclined.  Spoke with tech support and they asked about the wifi connection, saying it could have been interrupted.  I had a 2nd gen dot in the same location with no issues prior.  Router and connectivity is not the problem.  After more questioning and a brief hold, the rep responded there is no known problem with the 3rd gen echo.  Hopefully Amazon will addresses this issues as it appears this is not an isolated instance (do a quick google search).  Until then, I cannot recommend to others."
1.0,"December 17, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I got this for my Dad, who is blind and in a nursing home, to replace a refurb Echo Dot.  I did this when I visited him, 1500 miles away.  It worked flawlessly, the sound and bass is awesome, and then it failed the day before I was flying home.  He would ask it to play music by some artist, and it would say it was going to play that artist, and then silence.  Nothing.  I power-cycled it and it started working fine.  Then, simply power-cycling it didn't work.  Although the light ring indicated that it recognized the wake word, it wouldn't even tell me the time.  Again, the refurb Dot worked.  A few hours before leaving him to prepare for my flight, I unplugged it and plugged in the Dot; redundancy.  After about an hour, I unplugged the Dot and plugged the new Echo in.  Worked great!  However, I was not confident that it would work for the 3 months I'm away, and didn't have the time to get on the phone with support for a replacement.  Well, it failed again, and I really can't do anything about it other than buy him another.  You see, I've been on the phone with support for another failed Echo, and I doubt that I could get a replacement authorization without being physically present, hence the low score for support.  And after mid-January, I won't be able to have it replaced.  Don't get me wrong, I love the Echo in general.  I have an Echo, Echo Plus, Echo Connect and three Echo Dots.  Statistically, I've had good luck with the Echo products, which is why I purchased a new one for my Dad.  Maybe I'll call support and see if I can get a replacement now, 1500 miles away and unable to touch it.  If I can get a replacement, I'll give it 5 stars, since when it works, the sound is incredible (well, in a nursing home room)."
5.0,"December 2, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I have had the echo dot 2nd gen, 3rd gen, and now the regular echo 3rd gen. From what I understand the echo 3rd generation is the same speaker as the echo plus 2nd generation except it doesn't have Zagbee integration (whatever that is). Sound wise echo is better than the dot, by a fair margin. Is it 1000 dollar studio monitor speakers good? No. Is it worth 60-100 bucks? Absolutely. They sound just as good as any normal pc speakers you would get from Logitech or Harman. If you want to know if the dot or this is worth getting just get this. The dot has good sound quality but only 4 microphones ontop so it's DEAF. It will hear you when it feels like it, this one has like 12 microphones so it will hear you. Get the echo skip the dot."
5.0,"December 21, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I currently own the echo dot 2 and a couple of the 3rd generation dots. I would always listen to my Amazon Music playlist while I cleaned around the house. I needed something with a bit more volume and sound so I went with this 3rd generation echo. The difference is definitely worth the upgrade. Voice recognition is better among other things. I love all of the features that Alexa has to offer. My son who is almost two has just recently started talking and he will randomly blurt of ""lexa playyyy shots!"". Of course he doesn't emphasize the A in Alexa so I help him out a bit and he gets a big ole grin on his face when Lil Jon and LMFAO start to play. The Alexa skills are great. The Guard mode when away also allows Alexa to listen for smoke alarms and glass breaking. This would result in a notification pushed to your phone. I would love for them to ad a feature that allowed several echo's to monitor these sounds while home. With one in the basement, kitchen, living room, and upstairs bedroom, It would be amazing if Alexa could hear a smoke detector from the basement or kitchen and then alert my bedroom echo with a very loud alarm. This would allow me to wake up much sooner since it takes a bit for smoke to get upstairs. Even then, Its hard to hear a smoke alarm in a hallway when you run a fan or window AC all night. Who wouldn't want to get out of the house before a fire got out of control? Amazon....please consider this feature. It would definitely save lives. It could even save households that keep fire extinguishers on hand. Anyways, buy this echo. You won't regret it."
2.0,"January 6, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I got this Echo to replace an Echo Dot & get the improved sound quality. The sound quality is indeed excellent.  The Alexa integration works just fine, and the voice quality & recognition are excellent.  What's not to love? Well, the problem is poor WiFi performance.  I give it 5 stars for voice, integration and sound.  However, the WiFir performance - an absolutely critical element - is poor at best.  One star for that. I have reset the device several times, moved it around the room, and done everything I can but it just has poor WiFi.  The Echo Dot I replaced could stay connected and stream literally all day long without hitch in exactly the same spot with the same WiFi. This unit, on the same WiFi, the same day, could not stream for 5 minutes before skipping and losing connection on any of several tests. As a final test, I connected it to a WiFi unit in the same room. No problem - it works beautifully if it is literally in the same room as the 802.11 device. That's not practical. I am a huge fan of Alexa & the Echo's (sounds like an 80's band name) but this Echo hits a sour note.  I don't know if it is firmware or the chip set that is poor, but it's just not up to Amazon's previous device standards."
3.0,"December 4, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"The sound is a bit muffled, but the bass and volume are good. Fairly close to the Gen 1 echo (unlike Gen 2, which is horrible). I did a side by side comparison like I did with the Gen 2. Gen 1 had a clear victory in clarity and a slim victory with bass and volume. On a separate note, I'm having some trouble with the Gen 3 staying engaged when I request something. The blue light turns off before I can finish the second word after Alexa."
5.0,"December 5, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I bought this to replace an Echo Dot 3 in my family room. My intention was to get improved audio quality for music. The audio is somewhat better than the Dot3 that it replaced. However, this unit  often fails to hear, or comprehend, my voice commands, and those of my wife, a problem which the Dot 3 that it replaced in precisely the same location never displayed. In fact, the Dot 3 which I moved to an adjacent room often picks up my voice commands when I am speaking to the Echo in the family room, and the Dot 3 is about 3 times the distance away with no direct line-of-sight to the family room. HOWEVER.... I was asked to return this item to Amazon, sending it to their Engineering lab. in Sunnyvale, which I did. A couple of days later the replacement unit arrived, and once it was up and running the difference was immediately obvious. The replacement unit will respond to a quietly voiced command from across the room, and misunderstood commands are very, very few. Thanks, Amazon! Great customer service and a good outcome.

5.0,"December 3, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Absolutely enjoy this purchase!! Bought to pair with my echo plus and firetv 4k. With the *Home Theater update* in the alexa app, creating a 'home theater group' was a breeze. Nice sound quality, no audio delay/sync issues, well constructed... It just works great upon set up. The only con is not with the echo itself, but with volume controls within the alexa app. It would be very beneficial if users were able to control Left/Right channel volume controls independently from one another rather than solely as a pair. (As applies to Home Theater mode only). **NOTE: while in bluetooth mode or in 'stereo set' left/right volume can be controlled independently* Would highly recommend."

I don’t want the $10.99 a month charge to stream the same song to each echo at the same time. I want to play my songs in the garage while my wife something else in the house.

3.0,"January 10, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"I really thought the Echo 3rd generation would be better.  While it does everything the Echo 2nd generation does the reviews I read said it was a better speaker.  It better but not as much as the reviews of videos and online reviews that I have read.  I again maybe set my expectations a little high by the reviews I read.  Many have said the sound quality was much better and the volume was much higher.  That's not the case if you ask me.  It seems if you want a better speaker through Amazon you have to go to the 199.00 Echo Studio and that's out of my price range right now.  I'm sure for 200.00 it's much better but again I'm reviewing the Echo 3rd generation and I know it's 100.00 cheaper but if I didn't get it on sale I would have sent it back.  I know Amazon until I guess the Echo Studio has been known for it's great speakers and it's suppose to be a great smart speaker but I beg to differ on that as Alexa isn't much of an AI though Amazon things she is as she says she's a great AI.  I have had my Echo 2nd generation for over 2 years and Alexa hasn't gotten smarter, though she can turn on lights and look at my cameras but that takes a while for the cameras."

I am a student and most of tech budget goes to stuff i want to study. I messed around with alexa and google and siri here and there, but was never all too impressed. The tech has really been streamlined and alexa has learned quite a bit. The voice recognition has significantly improved and the smart gadgets it can control are getting more common. I bought this with an echo show and an echo input and an echo auto. The intercom function has been helpful twice already (10 days of use) and the sound is impressive. I was surprised by how clear and loud it is at max volume. The echo auto, used in conjunction with my echo at home is fantastic. I can control all my lights, my tv, my xbox, and more from my car. From anywhere, actually. More awesome is the fact that my car is not a cornucopia of technological advancements. All i have in there is a cigarette lighter and an aux input. All things considered, this product, and several of its other echo partners, was an awesome purchase. Especially at sale prices! 5 stars."
1.0,"December 28, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"edit- There’s no point in writing a negative review on an Amazon product because they won’t post it.  Just post the good ones.  I have my speakers paired and run them in stereo.  The set up was easy.  To me, the sound quality is OK ( I’m no sound expert).  But sometimes one speaker will stop playing in the middle of a song and start a new song while the other speaker continues playing the original song.  This happens often.  Then I have to tell Alexa to stop, then start again.  This is annoying. I’m hoping because the 3rd generation is new,  this is a bug that will soon be fixed."

The setup was easy but the Alexa app wouldn't connect to the Echo Wi-Fi on the first 2 attempts. I had to reopen the app and try again. The sound quality is amazing, amd fills the room well. Decent bass for a speaker of this size and price. Alexa is a little slow to respond, but typically in less than 1 second she'll answer you. She also has trouble streaming Pandora but it wasn't a show stopper and hopefully will work after a reboot. There's an interesting typo I noticed on my Echo box. ""She makes life easier by letting YOU voice control your world."" Hopefully I didn't receive a knock off from Amazon, but I would think a product like this gets proofread."

This came with a monthly installment option so I took the chance. At half volume this little thing has amazing sound and although you won't get club bumping base you will get enough to give the song a great sound. You can listen to local radio stations, audio books and other services like Pandora, Apple Music, SiriusXM, Spotify etc so you aren't just limited to Amazon Music.  Alexa hears me well. I can talk like I normally would and she responds. Even  my Siri on my phone has to be yelled at often. The extras like reminders or countdowns to a specific date is great. I set up what orders are due next and she reminds me. I found the trivia of the day fun and interesting.

But I turned down to about 75% and my living room sounds like a live concert no matter what genre I play (I love most music from classical, opera, old rock, old rock & roll, blues old and new all the way up to today's heavy metal!)

1.0,"February 4, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"This speaker is probably the most muffled and worst sounding speaker I've ever purchased. I've done all of the suggested tricks, updated Alexa app, total reset of the Echo, made sure the Echo is running latest firmware, reset my router, used the equalizer in almost every possible setting. Alexa's voice sounds like it's under a pillow and music has almost no highs or midrange, sounds very muddy. I have a small Google Home mini, not the new one, but the first version. That tiny thing sounds *much* clearer on voice and music. I'm so disappointed, I had really been looking forward to good sound with the Echo 3rd generation. With so many five star reviews all around mine, I wonder if mine is somehow defective, except if I look up “muffled” in reviews search, there are a lot of people complaining about it."
3.0,"December 3, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I would not pay $100 for this.  $60 or less is about right.  The sound right out of the box is pretty bland but I did locate some equalizer settings in the Alexa app that made it better. Unfortunately, that's just not enough. I like it loud  and when you approach the 3/4 mark on volume the bass drops out and you are left with hollow muffled sound.  Although not up to my rock out level, I found it to be fairly loud considering its footprint. Speaking to Alexa at a pretty decent volume actually worked....No more screaming at the dot from the shower to SKIP!  I suppose I expected more from all of the glowing reviews but considering the build and size of the speaker I should have suspected the performance capability.  This doesn't work for my audio tastes so this will be returned. I hope the Echo Studio performs better."
2.0,"February 11, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I purchased this because I listen to music in the house, particularly the kitchen a lot.  I have an echo dot 3rd gen and the sound quality was just not doing it for me. Is the sound quality better than the echo dot?  Yes, the echo dot is mildly better than listening to music on your phone's speaker. Is the sound quality good? Not really. The bass is big . . . BIG.  It tends to overpower the rest of the music.  If you're looking for cymbals to have a crisp satisfying sizzle, the 3rd gen Echo is just not going to do it.  As more layers and instruments build in a song, the sound gets muddy and the bass takes over.  For direct comparison I used a $50 bluetooth speaker that has been my go-to for affordable and portable music around the house.  Now this does not have audiophile quality sound, but it is passable and is able to give music some separation in order for it to be enjoyable.  It blows the Echo out of the water.  I've tried several locations in my kitchen in case acoustics were throwing things off, but to no avail. Does the Echo have bad sound?  No I wouldn't go that far.  Frankly, I just expected more out of a $100 speaker.  If music is your thing, you're better off going for a purpose-built speaker or an Alexa enabled speaker that puts sound quality first.  It is still evident that the primary function of the Echo is to be an Alexa hub and not a speaker. For reference, I used songs I know well with lots of layers.  Foo Fighters are a go-to and Madness by Muse for building and adding layers. Unfortunately the 3rd gen Echo dulled these songs and just made them feel numb.  If you're looking to get the best out of the Echo, you'll have to play with the audio settings.  For me, I have the treble at +3 and the mid range at +2.  The bass is plenty as-is. Bottom line/TLDR:  If you want an Alexa hub first and foremost, get an Echo Dot - better value.  If you want a speaker first with the added bonus of Alexa, spend the extra money and get one purpose-built to play music.  The Echo suffers from middle child syndrome and does all things OK, but there are better options out there depending on what your priorities are."
4.0,"December 31, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Received my echo 3rd Gen unit over the holidays due to an ongoing promotion. It has great sound over the Dot version hands down - good base and highs. It takes a bit of investment of your time to learn all the nuances of what Alexa can do for you. With the app, you can set up your Echo to be an alarm clock, timer, grocery list, teach it a routine for each day (like giving the weather forecast, the latest news from a specific news source, turn on/turn off lights, thermostat control, play specific music (classical, rock, pop) etc.). But beware, the instructions for all this are not included with your Echo. You have to dig around (through e-books, YouTube, etc.) to become familiar with the commands and required outcomes. For example, my unit began to display a pulsating yellow light that became annoying at night in my bedroom. I couldn’t turn it off except by disconnecting the power. Of course, this could’ve become a deal breaker if I had to disconnect every nite (I kept all the shipping package just in case I needed to return it). Well, it turned out that this was one way the Echo communicates with you. It was trying to tell me It had a notification for me to listen to. Until I asked, “Alexa, do I have any notification?” the yellow pulsating light would’ve continued. Immediately after delivering all notifications, the yellow pulsating light stopped. By the way, the notifications were about shipping/delivery of packages coming from, wait for it...Amazon. Of course, other types of notifications are possible pending how you program your Echo. Like I said, this simple issue would’ve been a deal breaker for me if I hadn’t decided to invest some of my time in trying to resolve this simple problem. It wasn’t until I learned how to communicate with my Echo that the problem wouldn’t go away. But again, the answer was not included with this product. My feedback to Amazon would be to include a list of commands and a trouble shooting section for the buyer. By employing this one simple act, I’m sure these products would be in far more demand by their customers once they learn the how to’s of communicating with these aliens. Beginning to love my Echo!"

2.0,"January 11, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I purchased this version of the echo because I wanted a better sound quality for the music I like to listen to. However, there are multiple skills that when asked to play Alexa says they’re playing but no audio comes out. The skills work properly on the app on my iPhone and on the Dot that I have in another room. It’s just this particular device where things are not playing as they should. I called customer support and we walked through the whole process with them on the phone. They were supposed to look into the matter and get back with me but no one ever has. At last check, sometimes the streams’ audio will play and sometimes it won’t. Every time I check to make sure it’s not the stream that is down. It has always been the echo that does not work."
5.0,"November 5, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,This is an amazing product the power on this speaker is unbelievable! It works well with my Amazon music and I’m sure it will work well with all the other apps that it offers. I specially love the special functions where you can put in a sentence and ask Alexa a specific response LOL it’s quite enjoyable. She’ll do just about anything you want her to all the way down to being your alarm clock. I was thoroughly impressed I was in my living room and could talk to her in my bedroom.
5.0,"December 5, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,Please. Please. Please do yourself a favor and find and read the 1 star review from Kurtiss. He was expecting a super smart futuristic robot that he could “engage with.” Lol. That made my day. Of course the poor guy was disappointed. Sounds like he could really use a friend. Let’s be honest. We buy this thing so we can slump a little further into our insanely lazy ways. One less button to push. Instant gratification. And it’s got pretty good sound for the price. Especially if you grab it on cyber Monday. Alexa. I’ll still be your friend even if you’re not the brightest robot. And even though you’re spying on me. It’s not like big brother is gonna learn anything new about me from you anyway. So have at it.
5.0,"December 26, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"So, after buying and trying a couple of echo dots, I bought 2 of these 3rd gen echo’s. I must say I was quite impressed with the sound after the dots. I also paired with an echo sub and a 4K Firetv Stick. With the Alexa app, the capability is there to set up a “theater” system. Actually it works pretty well. Setup took about 15 minutes including the speaker software/firmware updates. Sound..... So I’ve had for the last 20 years a 5.1 system with different high end receivers and Paradigm speakers. Now, I was NOT looking to duplicate the sound that system produced but, I was looking for something decent. Actually these 3rd gen’s paired with the little echo sub do pretty well. I’ve actually had quite a few people over that had in the past enjoyed my other system for “movie nights” or just sitting around playing cards listening to music, and they’ve all been impressed. Enough so that most are looking at setting up the same system at home. I’m not going down the road of specs and stats. I’m just going to say I’m impressed and would purchase all again. I’m hoping in the future there will be a firmware/software update that will integrate these speakers into a full surround. A 5.1 or even a 5.2 would be super. For now I’m extremely happy with them. For the price they’re great. If you’re an idiot looking for super audio file sound or Einstein knowledge for speakers then keep looking. I must say some of the 1 and 2 star reviews I read are, well, idiotic."
2.0,"February 15, 2020",Twilight Blue,with $40 Hue Smart Bulbs (color),"The Echo and the Philips Hue bulbs are sold as a package. Yet, the Echo could not discover the bulbs. I read latter, on the Philips website that these bulbs require a Philips hub or bridge. After sometime I called the Alexa tech support. They were quick to answer and we finally, after much trial and error, did get the bulbs paired with the Echo. A few days latter I had problems with the Echo sound crackling. Called Tech support again. Quick to answer. Had to reset the Echo. Discovered afterwards that with this reset the connection to the bulbs was lost. After much effort, Echo finally discovered the bulbs and back in business. I probably have about 4-5 hours in the efforts to pair the Echo with the bulbs so far. The bulbs have their own iPhone app that also control the bulbs. Philips updated the app and, once again, the connection was lost and Echo could not discover the bulbs. Called Tech support for third time. Again, quick to answer. But I am told I need a Philips hub. Well, I have already, through trial and error, paired them without the hub. This time, we could not get the bulbs paired. Now I have another 1-2 hours in trying to pair the bulbs to Echo. For the price of these bulbs this out not to be so difficult. This package should not be sold without the Philips hub. Or at least it should be clearly stated that one needs to purchase the hub when buying this package deal. The product description reads: Simple to set up - Easily connect these Philips Hue smart lights to Echo Dot (3rd Gen) via Bluetooth, no hub required. Just power on your light bulb and say “Alexa, discover devices”. ""NO HUB REQUIRED."" Yeah right! I sent everything back. I did receive all my money back. Thank you for that anyway."
5.0,"December 25, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,i had the 1st generation Echo that I bought from a friend in 2016. I loved it. The sound quality was amazing. It did amazing things. I played fun games on it. I got the weather. I set timers. I made shopping lists. I shopped on Amazon with it. Alexa woke me up. Alexa said good night. She turned on my lights and even set light timers for me. In time there won't be anything that we can't do with Alexa. She just keeps getting better and better and I have seen that progress since I first plugged her in back in 2016. I traded in my 1st gen Echo though Amazon. I told them the condition and right on the spot I had my trade in money to use towards the new 3rd gen Echo. They even gave me a shipping label to send it back to them and when they got it there was no issue with the trade in value I received. This new 3rd gen echo is great. The sound quality is far better than the 1st gen and that one sounded great regardless of how loud I played music. Alexa keeps getting better and am happy to have one.. well many now as I have one in each room. Highly recommended. It is life changing and the price is incredible for what you are getting and all the different ways you can use Alexa. I can't wait to see what happens next.
5.0,"October 20, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,Great sound quality! Love the hand free ability! Lots of family dance parties in the kitchen with the kiddos!
3.0,"December 25, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"2020.02.14 update. I am downgrading my review from 5, down to 3 stars. The sound is amazing for such a small device. I wanted to use them with Amazon Music. I got the sub-woofer and two, to create a full sound stereo system. Again, the sound is amazing. Connecting them to smart tv's, non-Amazon mp3 players, or my vinyl turntable, though ... I have found to be impossible. Alexa is pretty dismal, too. She responds more to the tv shows playing than my own requests. And she nearly NEVER gets my ""Play this..."" request correct. I tried to return them, but I'm outside the return window. I'd recommend just purchasing a proper sound system with a sub-woofer. You'll be much happier. (I also canceled the free trial of Amazon Music.) I bought two of these little gems, with a sub woofer. I synced  them all together to create my own little home sound system. The deep base of the subwoofer really adds to the already well-balanced sound of the third generation devices. I’m not super excited about the voice recognition. I gave it four stars. I’m hoping that as these devices learn how I talk, and the technology gets better, it will be more smooth to use. Right now, Alexa only gets 2-3 out of five commands right. That’s frustrating! The sound, though... makes this purchase worth it."
5.0,"January 7, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"It does pretty good recognizing what we say. We were able to put both of our Amazon accounts in it. For the size of the speaker, it actually sounds great. I was able to set up a voice command that controls all of the Christmas decorations in the house, which are spread out over 8 different Outlets. Turning them on and off became a house tour everyday. The adapter plugs were 4 for $20, relatively inexpensive. Next I'm going to replace one or two light switches, not all of them. Definitely the main one in the living room with the dimmer, so I can just dim the lights with a voice command. You don't have to buy expensive WiFi bulbs, you can actually replace the outlets and light switches if you want, or buy Outlet adapters if you only want one of the two outlets to be controllable. My only word of caution would be there that recordes everything you say after the Wake word, so you may want to go in now and then and delete your recordings. They say this will affect how well it recognizes your voice, but so far I don't see that happening. I have friends who use the Google and Siri products. They don't seem to work nearly as well as this does."
3.0,"February 5, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Hooked it up to my wifi and linked to my spotify. To my surprise you cant control spotify from the alexa app, linking accounts only enables you to say “alexa play X from spotify”. This means you cant browse your music or even adjust the volume without saying “alexa alexa alexa” like 5 times, big annoyance for me. You can connect the speaker via bluetooth which fixes the problem but introduces another problem. The speaker randomly disconnects, or stops playing music altogether. Since it wasnt good for music, i plugged it into my tv via aux, but when you play audio from the tv there is a 3-5 second delay when playing youtube videos every-time you click on a new video. To make matters worse its not even loud enough for a small living room. While this speaker does sound clear, it doesnt get loud enough. Music sounds like its coming straight up from the speaker as well, there is no feeling of “fullness”. considering this is advertised as a 360 speaker. Lastly there is no way to lower alexas’ voice volume, and for some reason her voice is louder than music playing through the speakers ...."
5.0,"February 19, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"After receiving this thoughtful surprise gift from my husband, I somewhat hesitantly agreed to give Alexa a try.  I am not technology driven by any means, but after some initial training, I became friends with our new family member, Alexa.  I have used ""her"" service for learning the 7-day weather forecast, driving directions to almost anywhere, for answers to a myriad of questions (best homemade shower cleaner, recipe for broccoli soup, most popular baby names in the 50's - and on and on) There isn't much that this young lady doesn't know!  My absolute favorite use of my friend Alexa is to play songs of my choice.  I love to listen to music doing housework, while taking a shower and during any other activity that allows me access to this ingenious equipment.  There are songs I haven't heard in years that Alexa plays for me with gusto.  The ever-brilliant quality of Bose speakers supports and shares all of my favorites, from Jazz, swing, country, blues, holiday songs, show tunes, etc.  I could never own all of those requested cd's, but Alexa puts a smile on my face whenever she comes up with exactly the unique version of a song I am just dying to hear.  Alexa certainly makes dusting a lot more palpable - and she's gone from being an unwanted visitor in my home to a very welcomed addition to our family.  Alexa, take a bow!"
2.0,"January 6, 2020",Charcoal,Echo," Dissapointed that this device keeps freezing and becoming unresponsive most often when playing music. Amazon tech support recommendations were to reset the device which doesn't work. It fixes the problem in the moment but doesn't fix whatever the underlying issue is. I have not had this problem with any of my other amazon devices. If regularly unplugging and restarting your device isn't a problem for you then it's a great product. It's materials are good quality, sounds fantastic, looks great but I can not overlook its faults... especially if I can't trust it to play music while putting my toddler down for a nap."
4.0,"January 14, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I like the sound of the 3rd Generation echo. The base if very good and the high are also very good. It does seme to be a little slow at responding to its name compared to other echo devices like the 3rd generation dot. By feel, you can't tell the differences between the echo 3rd generation and the 2nd generation plus. This is coming from a totally blind person. I wish that the 3rd generation echo had a build in temp sensor so I could get the temp of the room like the 2nd generation Echo plus does. There isn't any reason it couldn't have this. My own thoughts! All the echos should have that ability."
5.0,"December 2, 2019",Sandstone,Echo,"wasn't very keen on any smart speaker. but we decided to buy one with black friday sale price. Was a bit worry about installation, activation, privacy, and what if it's a faulted product? all worries got cleared after we received the product. plugged in. downloaded alaxa app to the phone and connected the echo to wifi. it works beautifully. and it is fun to speak to a speaker to ask she to play a music. The music seems to be mostly working with amazon music.  I still can't figour out a way to ask alaxa to play the music in my phone. One advise to any new Echo users: it's very helpful & useful to google any question (how to... echo...) if you are unsure about how to make echo work."
5.0,"January 9, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"This was a Christmas gift.  I did not want it, left it boxed for a few days, and generally wondered about sending it back without offending the gifter.  Then I un-boxed it.  30 minutes later I ordered another Echo for upstairs, and since then purchased a Sonos Beam with Alexa soundbar for our TV.  It's like an entire new world to us. As perspective, we use Siri for dictation and questions, but had a scary incident when the ""Hey Siri"" feature was first activated by Apple.  We discovered she was listening to us when Siri started replying to what she heard on TV.  So that feature got turned off  fast on our iPhones and iPads.  The fact that we can switch off Alexa's microphone is of great comfort to us.  But more importantly, the many things Alexa can do that greatly expands our electronic footprint and comfort zone was worth the effort.  We are happy campers.  I just wish Alexa would stop asking if we want to order more pet treats...we're afraid our pup will bark while we're out and who knows what we'll end up with."
5.0,"December 7, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,"Sound Quality is an improvement to the 2nd gen echo. After about 2 weeks of moderate usage at 60-70% volume the speaker has sounded better than it did day one, as most speakers need time to break-in. Comparing it to the 2nd gen echo you can definitely hear a difference. There is a bit more low end compared to the 2nd however, I find the mid range to be more refined on the 2nd gen as the 3rd gen has more low end and high end sound. To get this straight. This speaker isn’t meant to provide room filling rich sound as it is only a single firing 3 inch woofer and a tweeter enclosed in a compact plastic housing. If your looking at rich sounding sound docks, bose soundtouch 20 or 30 would fulfill that much better and even though those are more room filling as well, audiophiles will still find it much suited to having an actual speaker and amp setup. I myself am considered an audio snob and I love playing around with audio equipment. I’m not going to compare the echo to a proper 7.2.2 channel setup but compare it to speakers in its class. Being that this is an Amazon Alexa Device it is a very useful tool in addition to your smartphone. I currently have 6 echos throughout the house and they do what they are supposed to do and that is having voice commands for lights and even notifications for your ring system as well as other smart devices you link to your Alexa account. Having the ability to connect Bluetooth to your phone is great as well if your not looking for a portable battery powered Bluetooth speaker. My main reason for purchasing this echo is the new speaker which attracted me to purchasing this and I mainly use it only in the kitchen as having background music and being able to control lights and sound while working on other things. Sound is great for the kitchen and it is plenty loud enough with very balanced sound and I find the bass to be good for it’s size. I would like to put my bose soundtouch in the kitchen but it takes up too much room and I can just place this in a corner and it’s compact enough that you won’t have to worry about knocking it over. However I have setup my echo dot onto a sound dock and linked the multi room audio so I can have music playing through Apple Music in all rooms through the echos which I think is what sets this speaker apart from let’s say the much more expensive Sonos or Bose Soundlinks. Only downside I wish I could do is have Bluetooth work with multi audio instead of having to play playlists or through other streaming services on the echo."
3.0,"January 23, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I have 8 Echo Gen 3 speakers with 4 Echo Sub woofers covering 4 rooms.  Each room has the two Gen 3 speakers in stereo mode + sub woofer.  The stereo configuration with the sub woofer makes a HUGE difference in the sound quality. The sound is comparable to that of Sonos devices at a fraction of the cost. Setup can be a bit flaky but eventually does work.  Whole house audio on Eero mesh wireless is hit or miss but that was a secondary benefit for me.  If that is a primary reason for purchasing for you that could take this review to a one star.  Sometimes Amazon sees devices on different access points as being available to one another.  Sometimes it doesn't. The only thing that really ""gets my goat"" is the lack of gapless playback.  Isn't all that important for most listening but when it is important it is a must have. I.e. Pink Floyd, Classical music, Live recordings, white noise recordings. Silence between tracks of audio that is meant to be have no gaps is unacceptable.  I've been using digital music since the mid 90's and have always had the option of playing gapless.  Yahoo had this down way back then but Amazon can't get it done?  It is 2020.  Right? Also had to buy two of the Gen 3's from another source because Amazon limits a personal account to purchasing six without switching to a business account.  I don't understand why (other than profit) they do that.  I'm a retail customer wanting to purchase a reasonable amount of speakers for my personal use.  I should have been able to order all eight of my speakers at one time from Amazon."
3.0,"December 26, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I ordered the new third generation Echo on Black Friday. What upset me right off the bat is that it was shipped to me in a flimsy Tyvek envelope. No extra packing for protection. As for the unit itself, it  is very similar to the second generation Echo. The sound is a little bolder with more base response. The only issue, so far, is with the end of request response sound when it is switched on in settings. For no apparent reason, it occasionally blares at full volume at the end of request response. The only remedy is to turn off the end of request sound in settings. No such issue with my first and second generation Echoes."
2.0,"December 30, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"So I ordered two of these echos and 1 sub for 2.1 home theater surround sound. Big fan of amazon products. Very disappointed with the home theater set up and if your buying for that purpose, it’s not worth it. I’m running on 5ghz. There is always an issue. One side it working and the other isn’t. Then it swaps, then they both work but the sub is not working. If you watch tv in the early mornings like 5-6am, forget about it. No sound because the devices are unreachable for some reason. Then you have to unpair and pair them again(some devices would still show unreachable. Then you gotta unplug device and plug again). There are set up in my living room where my WiFi is. My point is that it’s not seamless connect, since I got it I’ve always been playing around with it to make it stay connected. Gotten to the point where I disconnected it and just hearing sound through my TV. Thinking about returning an echo and sub as I don’t need two echos and I’m not going to have a sub laying around for no reason. Oh and to connect musics, forget about it. The app is horrible for music. I can’t even choose a song from my Apple Music to play. I had to create a playlist for amazon on my Apple app and in the amazon app I can’t even choose the song I want to play or even shuffle the music!

Now we have one Echo 3rd get in the kitchen and a 2nd get in the master bath and to be able to play music out of both is pretty awesome, the intercom feature is cool, and making phone calls hands free is such a convenience. Amazon is headed the right way with Alexa and Echo. I don't care that they are listening in on me. People get so petrified of that. Who cares? I'm not important. Nobody cares what I have to say. If they want to listen to me, let them. Both speakers have a mute button so you can turn off Alexa from hearing what you say. I never use it. Overall good experience from both speakers."

Placed the Echo in my bedroom to help with morning and evening routines. It is my first Echo device and have found the convenience of the functions to be both good utility and fun technology to use. Set up a routine to turn out the lights, say the weather forecast for the morning commute, and play music to fall asleep to. Then another routine to wake up to an alarm, turn on the light at 50% brightness, say the current weather and traffic, a daily briefing of selected news, then play motivational music to wake up.

Now I have owned the last model of echo, not the dot which is for me is really a terrible one on its own, this model is a really much better speaker with a full sound a $100 can buy, yes there are far better speakers but who listen to those everyday, for me a really good sound that fell a mid size room is what most of us want.

I just received it today and my hard to please self is very pleased with the sound! I see reviews that sonos is better, HomePod is better, but really? How can you compare echo to devices that are multiple times the cost. I am hard to please with my devices, and am an Apple guy. However I’ve had dots for a couple years and like Alexa. I will keep Apple for mobile devices. For easy to place speakers the house I will use Echo s,art speakers.

The sound of my Echo is incredible to the point where I am still considering keeping the one I bought for my wife for myself. I want stereo. I listen at night before I go to sleep and love being able to listen to all the songs I've loved for some time now. As for controlling other items, this started out a little bumpy, with the smart plug I bought. I initially felt sorry for those controlling their whole house with smart devices for Alexa to control. Over time though, the smart plug started working better to the point where now it works 100% of the time.  This took about 1 week and the plug was promptly replaced by Amazon once.

My second Echo (the Sandstone) I rec'd as a gift from my son who suggested I locate it across the kitchen from the first 3rd gen Echo so I could listen to my music in stereo.

Wow, the separation and sound quality I now have in my kitchen brings me such happiness while I listen to my favorite tunes as I go about my cooking and kitchen chores. I realize my 3rd gen Echo is capable of so much more than I tap in to, but for me, for now, I am very happy to have it to bring requested info, news, and musical joy to my day."
4.0,"November 9, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,It’s fine. It’s an Echo so don’t expect it to be an awesome speaker. It does well what it’s designed to do which is fine. I can tell a little bit of an upgrade from my previous 1st generation as far as the sound however it’s not what I use to give me great room filling sound. I happened to purchase it when trading in my old one and getting an extra few bucks off with that so it seemed like a good deal.
5.0,"December 27, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Generally Alexa is fairly good at finding more common music from a more recent era but a bit rusty on years gone by. She might recognize ""Blue Skies"" but not ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"". She fails at Classical Music as well. I prefer to send her to my Pandora collections because I know what type of music I will get. She does well with Broadway though! Since she is coming into the house by Wi-Fi connection, I wish she could play my music on my Windows 10 computer like she does for Pandora when we set her up. App setup for Windows 10 computers from Amazon does not work and produces errors which technicians do not solve and wish to sell technical services from $150. The Alexa App is free from the Microsoft store, installed by me after I declined their help and my unit works well on all my devices - computers, cell phones, Fire HD's and tablets."
5.0,"November 6, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"The newest iteration of the vanilla Echo has much better sound than the previous generation. I would say it's definitely more of an upgrade from 2nd to 3rd generation in terms of sound than there was between 1st and 2nd. I love the Twilight Blue color, but I do have one question: since the new Echo is the same size and form factor as the Echo Plus (2nd Gen), why not offer that device in the new color? Seems like it should be incredibly easy to do so."
5.0,"November 2, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,The bass is amazing. I like the size and audio sound quality. Makes for a great speaker. Next I'm going to try and integrate it with my TV. I'm replacing my two dots with this 3G.
3.0,"February 7, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"I was really shocked when I got the third generation red Echo. It appeared to have the same fabric as the second generation red, and I didn't notice the white top when I ordered. When I took it out of the box, I was struck by its cheap look. I bought this for my living room, but it is so ugly that I don't want to use it in there. The second generation red had some variation in the color that made the fabric look much richer. This very plain solid fabric and the domed white plastic top make this so tacky-looking. It reminds me of a plastic gumball machine. I attached a picture of the two items next to each other. I just wanted to let people know if you think you are getting the nicer-looking second generation style of Echo you are not. The third generation makes the previous model look elegant by comparison."
5.0,"January 14, 2020",Charcoal,with $10 Smart Plug,"This Echo came with a Smart Plug as a bundle thus saving me lots of $$$. Set up was a breeze with the Amazon Alexa App; the same for the Smart plug as well. How cool is this - when I leave or enter my home; I say, ""Alexa turn off the light."" or ""Alexa turn on the light."" I start my day by asking Alexa for the weather; it actually saves time because I don't have to watch TV or go Online for a weather report.  I really enjoy asking Alexa to play my favorite music; the speaker does sound awesome. I gotta admit the darn device is fun! I'm glad I purchased it. Update: lov'n it, so much fun! Yes, you can delete your speaking history via the Alexa App by going to settings, Alexa Privacy, then Review Voice History - ""Enable Deletion by Voice.""  It's that easy or you can do it manually if you prefer."
5.0,"December 17, 2019",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"I just received my All-new Echo (3rd Generation)- Smart Speaker with Alexa, (RED) edition! I am excited to have a larger Echo, and in the Limited Edition Red! It looks great in my  bedroom and the sound is awesome for such a small device! I got addicted to the even smaller Echo Dots a few months back and now have 9 of them scattered throughout my home, shop and garage. These darn things seem to be multiplying, somewhat like tribbles! So now I have the regular ""mommy"" sized Echo and a 2nd Red one on the way! I am really enjoying all of these Echo's, and I love this Red one! The red is not as deep looking as what is on the ad, but it is attractive. It's got kind of a coral tinge to it, but it brightens up my room. I'm planning on using the other red one on the other side of my new TV!"
3.0,"January 19, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"Sound quality is pretty good for such a small inexpensive smart speaker.  Seems to understand my voice relatively well, but not perfectly... but good enough.  Alexa, as per usual, continues to be very mediocre with understanding phrases.  As a result, I only really use Alexa for playing music and checking the weather (which it does adequately).  If you want to ask Alexa anything remotely complex, such as fact-finding or helping you figure something out, 9 our of 10 times she fails.  The exception to this, of course, is anything related to purchasing via Amazon.  It becomes quickly obvious that this device is expertly optimized to help you spend more money on Amazon, faster. One issue I had with this speaker is that it would stop playing new songs after completing one song (e.g. would not advance to the next song on its own).  This spontaneously resolved itself after a few weeks, and the cause/solution remains unknown."
5.0,"December 29, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"This is our second Echo unit since the first one ended up in my 18 years old boy's room after couple of weeks of sitting in the kitchen.  I think the 3rd gen. sounds even better than the previous one was. More bass, more depth to the overall sound. The only thing came right off as a negative impression was the shape. The 2 gen. was a sleek, very stylish piece of electronics that you could easily blend in with your other stuff in any room in the house. The fabric that covered the speakers and the shape of the tower itself gave you more opportunity to place it among anything basically. This one is chubbier and a bit duller. It's not a deal breaker at all, just an observation. I guess the better sound quality means bigger speaker units means increased circumference means chubbier looks. Besides the difference in the aesthetics it is a great product!"
1.0,"January 7, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Before I write my review let me say that I install over 300 Amazon echos every year for my company in brand new homes. I even own 9 Amazon echos in my own home and vehicle. Prior to using this Amazon Echo 3rd generation I had Amazon Echo 2nd generation speakers in my living room set up as a theater system group. They worked great! Each Echo had a different wake up work so I can speak to that particular Amazon Echo. One Amazon Echo was set up as left speaker and one was set up as right speaker.  I decided to upgrade my Amazon echos to the 3rd Generation Amazon Echo. After setting them up the same way I had my 2nd generation setup I can tell you that I am completely dissatisfied. although these speakers works great in a theater group when watching TV, use the wake up word Alexa to call my right Amazon Echo the light ring will respond but the echo with the Wake word Echo response verbally instead. If I remove the Amazon echos from the theater group The correct Echo will respond. I contacted technical support and they are completely clueless.  I then decided to test out my whole house group that I use quite often to play my music in every room. Most of the time my speakers don't respond at all and they don't play music. if they do respond , only 1 Amazon Echo plays the music even though these Amazon echos are in the same group that I asked to play. When I tried to tell them to stop , they acknowledge me speaking to them but do not stop playing the music. It became extremely frustrating to the point where I was yelling at my echo With no response. Amazon really needs to go back to the drawing board on this 3rd generation and fix their bugs."
4.0,"January 9, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"The sound is good, I sometimes wonder if I should have gotten the speaker with the sub, but good sound for what I did order. I spent three days trying to get Alexa to play ""Deadmen"" By Saint PHNX, a song I purchased. Even if I had not bought it she would not have played it. Kept wanting to play ""Deadman Walking"" by IDK and IDC. So if I had prime she would have queued that up every time. Finally, while almost placing my mouth on her, Alexa figured it out on the third day. But also it is in my only playlist, that I play, then it stops after like 10 songs. I do think Amazon is trying to gaslight me into buying prime for better use of my Echo. She does do well answering questions, turning on devices, playing what music I can get out of her though."
5.0,"January 6, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,"I have a Dot in nearly every room, many of them grouped for stereo and an Echo Sub. As this new Echo (3rd gen) was released, I got excited by learning the previous version, the Echo Plus, was compatible to group for stereo. So I purchased this and another Echo Sub and set it up in what we call our yoga room. It’s been great and I find myself just sitting in the room to listen to music. All that said, the Alexa service isn’t perfect yet. She has moments of inoperability and it’s super annoying when Alexa doesn’t hear you correctly or just stops playing altogether. But that is a different issue than the hardware. This speaker is great and I recommend it. (Note: This speaker does not have the hub feature, so get the Echo Plus if that’s what you require.)"
5.0,"December 5, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I got my first Echo as a gift from my brother, and I was extremely impressed with it. As a legally blind person, I can't use my laptop anymore, so the first Echo was a godsend. It helps me to find information, listen to podcasts, music and books, and play games and educate my s of in different ways, and easily order items I might need. The first device died after 5 years of use, and after some collaborations, I was able to gather enough gift cards for a replacement. I picked up the Echo 3rd gen, and I'm very happy. It's loud enough to drown out the neighbor's loud music and my roommates' Fox News; it's clear enough that I can hear my podcasts without straining, and it's just as easy to use as the original. Definitely worth the price. 10/10."
4.0,"December 25, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"A little buggy. Has trouble switching between different devices streaming to it. Had to delete and reinstall the app to get it to work with my TV.  I have both the Echo and the Dot and the multi-room music works well. Only complaint right now is that there is no integration with YouTube Music. I can't have Alexa play music from YouTube Music without streaming directly from my phone,  which defeats the purpose.  Amazon's unlimited music service is less than half the cost of YouTube Premium, so that's a good reason to switch I guess- but then I lose the ability to watch ad-free videos on YouTube.  Maybe I just talked myself into it.  I don't really watch YouTube videos. I'll probably check out the library on Amazon Unlimited Music and see if it compares."
5.0,"January 1, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,I have been enjoying Alexa devices for a few.mo the now. My first was a Echo Gen 2 and I love it. Then I was able to get a great deal on the Twilight edition Echo Gen 3 and am so glad I did despite the delay in deliver of the item. My kids also enjoy Alexa. The Echo had wonderful sound and we enjoy finding new skills that are useful and fun. Yes not all skills work well but you can always disable skills that don't work well for you or end up not being what you expected. Alexa is always learning new things and it is fun to figure out what new features and skills are coming up to add onto what you already enjoy about Alexa. My daughter and I also really enjoy using the drop in feature so we can call each other from different floors in the house.
4.0,"December 30, 2019",Sandstone,Echo,"I am not a tech type person at all.  I like music and happen to think of songs often and wonder who the artist is or want to hear the song, for this reason I give this little device rave reviews.  I am not all concerned with invasion of privacy much as all things have invaded and negatively impacted our privacy and health- nothing is as it seems, may as well enjoy some perks while getting the shaft.  The sound is great in a space of 500 sq ft., is responsive to my voice but I don't make request like I am talking to a human, there's no kids yelling to it, my house is quiet which may impact how Alexa software responds.  It's a new concept/device and as with most new things, it's not perfect.  And with all man-made things, it never will be."
3.0,"January 8, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Seems I got a lazy one. Sometimes it will give me a very detailed answer from Wiki or Google or some newspaper, but most of the time, it is too lazy to really look into what I'm asking about. I get a lot of ""Sorry. I don't know that."", or ""I'm not sure"". Occasionally, it will say, ""I'm working on refining my knowledge base"", but I think that's a cop out. I do like the music. Of course, that costs extra, as do most of the really cool things I would want to do. Also, it seems easily confused. I don't know: Maybe this one has baggage from not getting along with the other Alexa's in the warehouse."
5.0,"November 30, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,Upgraded my Echo 2nd generation for this 3rd generation so I could stereo pair this with a 2nd generation Echo Plus. The difference in just having a two Echos in a group and them being in a STEREO pair is amazing! The separation of left and right channels produces beautiful sound for the money!
5.0,"January 3, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I've had an echo dot (2nd gen) for awhile, so I was already accustom to interfacing with Alexa.  I used the dot primarily as a music player, and had it plugged in to a boombox-type of unit to improve the sound quality.  After reading about the Echo smart speaker's sound quality, I decided to give it a try.  I was immediately very pleased with the sound quality, and after doing a side-by-side comparison with the echo-dot-and-boombox arrangement, the new Echo smart speaker quickly replaced my former setup.  It has surprisingly good bass performance, considering its size, and reminds me of the sound quality of what I would call a ""table radio"" (for those old enough to remember such things).  All in all, I am very happy with this item."
1.0,"December 11, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I spoke with someone via chat about the 4 echo's I purchased and they are rude, not helpful and very impolite!!!!!

5.0,"January 31, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Ok, having several 2nd generation Echo's I was curious to what the difference would be.  First the size difference is slight but the 3rd gen is slightly larger, thus a little heavier but you are not really carrying it around. Testing it out for a few hours after receiving it last night I found that the bass was deeper and I would say a little richer but like the 2nd gen pretty great sound. I paired it to one of the 2nd gen's and I really lost some of the quality increases but I figured that would be the case when pairing to an older device.  I really don't like replacing things that aren't broke but if I were starting from scratch with what AMAZON has I would have to 3rd gen and the sub woofer ... but that may just be me."
1.0,"February 1, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"So I was hoping I could plug my non-bluetooth High Res Mp3 player into this, because it is ADVERTISED as having line-in capability. Nope. Regifting time. For what it's worth, I have plugged this player into literally every line-in situation you could think of and never had a problem. This may not effect the majority of people who only listen to music on their phones, but it does effect people who have their own off-phone/offline music libraries. It seems to me like the older models did offer this, but even the ""AUX"" function in the setup for the 3rd gen has disappeared now. Disappointing, for a $100 item to get rid of such a basic functionality while still ADVERTISING that it has a LINE IN. It DOES NOT have a line in. Period. I read and re-read the specs before I broke the seal on the box, too. ""Line-In/Line-Out"" .. False advertising!"
5.0,"January 14, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I'm interested in the potential of audio computing, in cases of visual impairment.  But also as a viable answer to the problems of screen-trance & lowering of life-quality due to trance addiction. The echo and echo dot are the first audio-devices I've used that appear to be programmed in a sensible way to reduce any frustrations with audio-only, rather than compounding them and sending someone back to using a screen. So you have a device here that can be used for the visually impaired, which I am, and yet don't need a doctor's order or permission to get help to enjoy....a reality of connection and information.  Please relay my thanks to the programmers.  It gives me hope.  I suppose that's kind of silly.  And it's not really a review.  But thank you, Amazon, for helping the disabled like me.  In so many ways...."
5.0,"December 16, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I'm truly loving my Amazon Echo, the sound from this speaker is fantastic for playing music, audio books.  I like that it connects to more products than any of the other similar devices out there and even connects to my Apple music and playlists.  I use it to operate my Hue Lights, play my Audible audio books, music, make phone calls, send messages, create grocery lists.  There more that can be done, I'm new to the Echo so each day I'm learning. One of the things I like also is that you can, with the touch of a button, mute the device if you don't want it ""listening"" for some reason.  I now want Amazon Echo's in every room, you can even use them like intercoms also.  You'll be happy with your purchase, I promise!"
5.0,"January 22, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Gets pretty loud, much better sound quality vs the echo dot. Alexa works the same, no change there compared to other voice controlled amazon gadgets. Cord is reasonably long. The wi-fi signal pick up is pretty good. I put my Echo in the back most part of my place, and my router is in the front most part of my place. A good 50 or so feet seperate the Echo from the router and it picks up signal, even streams podcasts well without much buffering. My router is newer, and not entry level, if that matters much. But it works exactly how I hoped it would based on my network set up and floor layout. Speaker gets plenty loud and stays pretty clear for my ears, but my rockstar audiophile days are over. But like I mentioned, it streams, picks up wi-fi and plays music good enough for me. Happy I picked the Echo up."
5.0,"December 30, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"This product is fantastic. For about 6 years I owned a popular mini speaker that rhymes with “pose”, “shows” and “blows” (I think you can figure it out) that cost more than double what the echo costs. As much as I hated the fact that I owned one of these “brand name” speaker, it actually sounded impressive for its small size, so impressive that I had it for 6 years. When I was contemplating buying some smart speaker, I was tempted with the Sonos for its sound quality and reputation but the price tag always seemed high. I bought the echo on a whim, as it were, and I’m thoroughly impressed. Not only does it put my old speaker to shame in terms of sound, ease of use and looks, the multi-room music and home-theater configuration options are second to none. After 2 days of owning this speaker, I bought another and bought an echo plus for another room in my house. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a smaller size speaker and doesn’t have the power of some bigger speaker out there, where you will be blown away is the value of the speaker. I haven’t seen a speaker this small and at this dollar amount perform as well as this speaker. 10/10 would recommended."
1.0,"February 8, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I bought two of the Echo 3rd gen speakers to pair with an Echo sub and a FireTV for the Theatre setup. This was ideal since my projector and FireTV are ceiling mounted and I didn't want to run audio cabling. However, it is a horrible setup that works less than half the time. The speakers take a long time to turn on audio after the Echo TV is turned on. It usually involved exiting out of an app and going back in 2 or 3 times. Half the time the volume control from the echo remote is extremely delayed. Right now as I type this I have the speakers beeping at me like I am turning up the volume, but in reality I was trying to change the volume over 10 minutes ago. I am about to scrap them and go another direction."

We have an av system and it is not compatible with it. we have it linked via the Heos app and it works to go to amazon music, but not spot a fi nor my iPhone just nor to play xbox thru it which is what we need. We run everything thru our hi end marantz av receiver and definitive technology atmos  system. So I would never play music thru the little speaker in it. We also have echo dot and it has our calendar on which should be on the echo, but can't figure out how to transfer. Just disappointed"
1.0,"November 22, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,I ordered  this Alexa because  I thought I blew it anapeaker in my old alexa. For some reason the volume is down on alexa.

This alexa you can not hear at all upstairs.
4.0,"January 19, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I bought this for the sound quality in my living room. I already have echo dots in every room of the house. Although this is more expensive, I found that it disconnected from the network frequently and had to call echo support a few times. When I ask Alexa to play a song and I’m standing right next to the unit, the song plays on an echo in another room on another floor! I was told by the echo team that the less expensive dots are more responsive to your voice. This makes no sense as it’s third generation, and has better speaker quality. Finally I changed the wake word of the dot in the other room, to avoid a conflict when making a request to Alexa. I’m not sure if I’ll be keeping it, but had hoped for more."
5.0,"December 17, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Bought this to replace a public beta-era Generation 1 unit. The first gen unit had slowed down a bit, and was beginning to struggle with running our smart home components, missing light bulbs and other things in the Hue network. This thing is FAST compared to earlier models. What would take 5-10 seconds of processing for the gen-1 takes only a second or two for this model. The sound quality remains excellent for music playback, and while the model is ""fatter"" it is noticeably shorter, making it slightly more subtle for where I have mine (on a table next to a wall). If you're looking to get your first Echo or upgrade from an older model I definitely recommend making the change."
4.0,"February 7, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Love my new Echo: setup was easier than expected, voice recognition's pretty good, the sound quality's great, alarms and reminders work, and I can play audio throughout the house on our Echo devices. One massive letdown: can't connect it to my Nigeria Apple Music account, which baffles me. Apple has Nigeria accounts, Amazon delivers to Nigeria, and (of course) both have accepted Nigeria debit cards for years, so what's the problem? Checked before buying and nothing there about regional restrictions. So now I'm stuck listening to the very limited music selection that comes with Prime until I can figure out a workaround that isn't ""get an Amazon Music account"". Knocking off a star for this nonsense. Will update once I've tried the phone and intercom functions."

For me, the difference isn't great enough to make it the single most important reason for the upgrade, but the line in jack was what sold me.  I wanted something for the devices I have that do not have Bluetooth and the slightly bigger sound is just a nice bonus. As usual it is easy to set up and performs as expected. Even though I can't make a stereo pairing with my Second Gen Echo, having them at opposite ends of the room and creating a group for them mmore than fills the room with very nice sounding audio so am quite pleased with my purchase."
5.0,"January 9, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"The Echo is small but it has a powerful sound. The ease of use is not there at this time. I have to ask Alexa to do things several times before she gets it correct, especially when it comes to the firestick, and it should not be that hard because they are both created in Amazon labs. I will give them a pass because this is a new technology. I love the fact that I have a GROUP called Everywhere and I can stream music on this Echo and all three dots at the same time and it is clean and consistent through the entire house. This is very nice on days when I am cleaning the house and go from room to room, and during the holidays when I had everyone over. Overall I am satisfied, and I look for even more things from Amazon. I also have a Ring doorbell, I am on my way!"
4.0,"January 6, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"We originally purchased a first generation Alexa when they came out. It is a great device that we still use in another part of the house now that we have this newer generation version. Aside from it being a little shorter and more stout, it's otherwise no different whatsoever from the first generation. The one exception to that is the sound. The bass is just slightly better on the new device, but not a lot to make an impact. Sound is still dull, with no defining highs or lows, just more a blaring mid range sound. If they can fix this or offer a device with much better audio, we'd get that. Is it with the money to upgrade from a Gen1? I'd say no, not yet."
5.0,"February 6, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I hesitated getting Alexa over privacy matters. But I got both the Echo and the Dot and I really enjoy both. The sound is clear and responsive. How did I get along without sweet Alexa? I especially like the one in the bathroom. I can call out instructions without having to touch anything while I am wet. In the kitchen, I don't have to wash and dry my hands to fiddle with tuning or volume knobs while I am cooking. If I get a telephone call or someone is at the door, I can call out to Alexa to ""turn off"" and I can immediately hear my caller or visitor. No more running to the radio to turn down the volume. Good purchase and soooo easy to set up."
4.0,"December 10, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Bought one of these for the kitchen. It replaces a Memorex Party Cube which had thoroughly degraded over a decade. The functionality of Alexa is discussed at length everywhere and is amazing. My only issue with this device is the sound quality. I think it's inherent to the design and I did anticipate this. First of all, the bass is astounding. I didn't know something this size could create that kind of bass. I'm afraid treble is another story. In order to create the 360 degree sound, the tweeter (as you can see in the product description) is pointed upward inside the device. It fires internally. The midrange radiates quite well out of the unit as reflected sound. However, the high frequencies (say, above 14khz) do not fare so well. So overall the treble slopes off quite a bit. The old Party Cube, like the Sonos One, has outward firing tweeters, so you are not relying on sound reflection for what you hear - you get the whole spectrum straight from the source, like conventional speakers. So you miss a bit of the magic of vocals, or drum high hats, atmospheric sounds and the like. Out of the box the overall tone is weighed quite a bit to mid bass. Alexa has some basic tone control (Bass, Midrange, Treble) which can help just a bit. Overall though, the Pros outweigh the cons on this device and I'm happy to have it!"
2.0,"December 9, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I like it, it sounds surprisingly good for such a small speaker.  Unfortunately it randomly shuts off.  To restart, it needs to be unplugged and then plugged in. This happens every 2 hours or so.  I wanted to exchange to hopefully get a unit that stayed connected but tech support had other ideas.  They wanted me to change the name and password of my WIFI network.  I explained that my WIFI stays connected without interruption to a TV, printer, 2 iPhones and 2 computers.  There is no chance that I will make changes to a properly functioning WIFI network, requiring me to update the network name and password on all my devices.  If tech support was accurate then the product design needs to be improved, a device should not require altering a perfectly functioning WIFI network."
1.0,"January 21, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I was doing a trade-in with my first generation Echo. Though the sound in the third generation was excellent, I had several problems that started a few days after I had it. Echo would stop playing music and books for a time, then just start back up. It double beeped periodically. It was not my Wi-Fi because my Dot had no problems at all. Music and books skipped and was garbled now and then. I reset the new one and did everything to rectify the situation. I then decided to keep my first generation and return the third generation. The third generation was introduced in September 2019. Too soon? Maybe or perhaps it was my particular device."
5.0,"December 10, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,I love my Echo's.  This is a perfect addition to my Echo Plus and other various dots.  I have them connected around the house mainly for music.  The Echo has much better sound than the Dot so they go in the rooms most open to guests.  The dots are used to fill in the back rooms where the lower quality won't be noticed as much.  So much other functions to offer but for now this is their main function.  Thank you Amazon!
5.0,"October 19, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Much better sound.  It's smaller by a bit too.  Easy set up.  Love it.  I bought 2 but might get a third. The sound improvement warrants that.  Also, the ability to sync all 3 to play the same tunes simultaneously."
4.0,"February 21, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,"Was looking to replace the echo on my nightstand, and finally decided to give this 3rd generation a try. Overall very pleased with it minus the voice recognition which seems to be worse somehow then the 2nd Gen, but the sound quality has been vastly improved for this price range and competitive with other smart speakers. The white does look pretty slick and glad to spice up things given I've always had black/grey echos, which can be bland and always boring when you look at them. If you're looking for a good quality, sounding, and performing speaker then this is an easy recommendation especially if you can get it for under $100!"
3.0,"January 19, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"Two dislikes, 1) the cloud misunderstands syntax, in skills/apps. EXAMPLE: I played the animal guessing game, and the transcript from our recordings say that Alexa heard me guess “a fox.” Alexa responded with “Not correct, the answer is fox.” Alexa requires you to say phrases that she knows, in the way she knows them. This example is most noticeable in trivia style app games. 2) the voice recognition is disrupted by its own playback! I never noticed this happening with the Echo Dot. The Amazon Echo is such a powerfully loud device that with 80% playback volume, you will have to scream ALEXA to get her to stop. If you only want Alexa for news, weather, and automation, get the Echo Dot. Which brings us to our many likes, 1) If you like loud music, this speaker can get really LOUD in an enclosed space! Awesome speakers that did not Clip at 90%. 100% volume was unbearably loud in my 10’x20’ room and will never happen. Music is as simple as saying “Alexa, play music” 2) power cord is ~6ft and comes with a white Rubber band to neatly contain any length you don’t use. 3) Great for home automation and playing music. App features allows you to call the speaker and talk to whomever is in the room, or if you don’t want to hear the response, announce something like a school principal."
5.0,"January 2, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"My daughter and her family asked for this newest generation Echo for Christmas. After we bought hers, we decided to get a new one for ourselves. Since we already have an Echo, I really thought about saving some money and returning ours. I’m so glad we didn’t! We just plugged it in yesterday and wow! The sound is just so much better! It’s beautiful! Also have to say that I love the blue color as well. For some reason, we didn’t even have to go into the Alexa app to connect this. We just plugged it in and she took over for the old Alexa.  Great purchase! If you listen to music you will notice a vast difference."
5.0,"December 30, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,"This was my 1st time purchase of an Amazon Echo device. So far I like everything about it. It is so amazing that it will play any genre , or even artist that I ask for. t gives me the weather so fast. I like the options of turning off  some of the features that I am leery about, such as ordering items thru Alexa. Maybe sometime I may be more comfortable doing this, but for now it's turned off. It is really nice hearing another person's voice.   I like this device so well that I ordered 2 echo dots. One for my bedroom and one for the kitchen, as well as 2 Amazon smart plugs for Alexa to turn on and off lights."
5.0,"December 11, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"The sound quality is amazing. Went with a bigger one to use for speaker mainly. Between me and my girls we now own 6 or 7 of these echo’s. The only one I don’t recommend is the echo input. It does not stay connected. In its defense I was too lazy to trouble shoot and just ordered a new echo instead. If you don’t have one. Get it. I will say it entertains the toddlers, but careful because Alexa hears what she wants to hear and sometimes plays inappropriate music. You can change that in settings if I’m. Or mistaken. I have mine connected through WiFi and I think it requires it. Might want to check on that."

4.0,"February 4, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I wanted to replace my old-school receiver and book shelf speakers I was using in my small vacation cabin. I wanted to also keep the sound quality of the system. I have a few Dots at my full time house so I am familiar with Alexa and the AI features. This speaker worked out great. The sound quality is high and I can put it out on the back deck or front porch (it does require power but I do have outlets). Because it is Bluetooth capable, I can connect it to my iPod - yes, I am old school - and also my laptop. I can get all of my favorite radio stations because almost every station now has internet capability. And, I can connect it to my Sirius/XM app without having the antenna.  In the long run, I may have sacrificed a small bit of fidelity but gained a lot more access to music compared to my old school receiver."
5.0,"December 29, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"As original Tap owners we were waiting for a major improvement before adding to our Alexia family.  Trade in was only $15 for the tab and we love that the tap has always been about privace, unless you turn it off in the app and that the Tap has a battery to take it outside on the deck. Our new Alexia has no battery and has the mute button to provide privacy.  It also makes calls which the Tap does not. Overall pleased with the new device, but keeping the Tap to take outside as wed need to bring an extension cord to the woods if we wanted to take the new device."
5.0,"December 31, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Works great. Easy to set up and fun to play with. Has a bit of problem recognizing voices (my sister and mom both get called my name), but overall can understand what we ask. It seems to forget some things that it knew at first. When I asked it to play a playlist from my Amazon music, it did it correctly the first few times and then stopped being able to figure out what I wanted. My one major complaint is that I can’t play music through Echo’s speakers if I have asked it to link to my Alexa enabled Bose speaker. I’d like to hear the music in both rooms but only one works at a time. Not the end of the world and I purchased the unit on sale for $79 so well worth the price."
4.0,"February 4, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I set up a home theater group with two echo speakers and a sub woofer. I am very happy with the general quality of the speakers, and would give them a five except for a few issues that I would have thought Amazon would have corrected. First, pairing the speakers was very difficult until I finally called support and learned that two of the speakers needed updates out of the box, something you would think the instructions would suggest. Second, the sub woofer cannot be adjusted lower enough to take out the thumping on certain types of music. Lastly, and most important: there is NO volume balance adjustment for the stereo speakers despite advertising to the contrary. Amazon’s own help site states: Amazon Device Support  › Alexa Devices Help › Echo Link and Echo Link Amp Support› Change Audio Settings on Echo Link or Echo Link Amp Use the Alexa app to adjust audio balance, the equalizer, and other audio settings.

Besides that, it does a lot of other things, but sometimes the way isn't what you think.  Example.  You can't make a list of songs such as a shopping list and ask Alexa to play them.  It must be a playlist in Amazon Music.  Remember, Amazon is only a phone call away and provides great help.  I know, because I've talked to them several times.  Tip.  Use the Alexa App on a mobile phone and when setting up communications make sure you use the mobile number."
3.0,"December 15, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"The sound quality is a huge improvement over the last gen echo. It’s basically the same as the second gen echo plus. It doesn’t work as a stereo pair though. However Alexa is pretty awful. It struggles to understand my commands and rarely ever plays the correct song on the first try. There are problems integrating with Apple Music. I feel like it’s somehow gotten worse. I already have a few of them but if I had the choice, I probably wouldn’t buy into this system again."
1.0,"December 29, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I just recently bought this device, I've had another one for a few years but I thought something was wrong with it, as looped sounds kept cutting off. Well I am having the same issue with this one. I use it for playing sleep sounds and now it cuts off every few minutes or cuts off all together, the exact same thing that had begun happening with my old device. I did some research and have since found out lots of people have been reporting this problem. It's bad enough Amazon farms their skills out to third party developers who are now trying to get people to pay for them, so you get long annoying ads as well as constant prompts for a 5 star review on your device..... (I've also seen where even if you get a subscription half the time it doesn't work and Amazon does nothing about it) but the looping problem is directly related to Amazon's product as it happens on the old and new devices and also happens when trying to loop music...think next time I will give Google assistant a try, maybe they make their own skills for their own device."
5.0,"December 26, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"This is my fourth Echo unit and I am impressed with the quality of sound from this unit. I own one of the first generation Echo and they have truly come a long way.  I like the fact that when I ordered it AMAZON asked if I wanted associated to my account, this made the setup process much easier. Since I started hanging out in my garage again, this Echo keeps me well informed and entertained, if I’m not listening to my news radio station, I’m listening to my favorite crime podcast or listening to smooth jazz. This is a truly great piece of gear and a great ROI."
4.0,"January 19, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"It’s just like the 2nd generation which is really good.  Nothing special though.  I bought the 3rd generation to pair with my Amazon Echo Studio since the $199.00 for the Echo Studio was way over priced and my 2nd generation would not be compatible.  Well 3rd generation is but definitely NOT impressed with the sound.  I bought into the hype and turns out that's all it is ""hype"".  Sound is fine so i think 4 stars is sufficient since i'm old enough to know better, Amazon does make good products and this case a ton of hype, which i also bought into.  Bad me."
4.0,"January 29, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I have the echo and the studio and they do sound good together, when they are together. It’s almost like each one has an idea of its own at times, instead of being totally in sync. Sometimes it’s like one has been paused and the other starts on a new song when ordered and the other has to find where it’s suppose to be and eventually get caught up. Not a deal breaker, just annoying sometimes. Also has some connection issues to devices at times, or vice versa, and I have to repeat two or three times to turn lights or lamps off. (Again annoying)"
1.0,"January 15, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Setup an Echo Plus using a pc on alexa.amazon.com. The device connected and showed online status in the home account page. Alexa voice response is extremely loud and above the level of any music playing. There appears to be no way to control alex's voice volume independently of the device. Spoke to amazon customer service which was of no help. Then transferred to a u.s. based associate in so-called amazon customer service.  Was told to speak to someone in the ""Echo Department.""  After being connected to the echo dept. was told that there is absolutely no way to control alexa's voice response independent of the device.  So if you're playing music at an average range, you can expect alexa to effectively shout at you in response.  This fact alone makes the echo plus functionally worthless. too bad I wasted so much time on this thing. Returning it immediately."
5.0,"December 30, 2019",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"We started out with an echo dot that we got free with our cable tv service. We loved it but it was so small we couldn’t hear it WEP so we decided to upgrade. This did not disappoint! The volume is amazing and Alexas voice is clear. Also, can hear me from across the house asking her questions etc. which is a definite bonus. Better than my iPhone and Siri who half the time doesn’t hear me and/or doesn’t answer my questions but instead tells me to open a webpage she found. Alexa has yet to tell me she doesn’t know the answer to something! Definitely worth the money."
5.0,"November 5, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,We absolutely love the newest generation. Sound is much improved over the first generation it replaces. Alexa seems to listen better too. The new design look great and love the new color option.
5.0,"February 17, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,I bought this for myself for Valentine's (hey... a girl's got to do what a girl's got to do!).  It was an upgrade from a 1st Gen dot.  Wish I had made the leap sooner.  Voice recognition is MUCH improved over the dot and the sound quality is amazing for the size of this little speaker.  I had been connecting my old dot to a Harmon Kardon speaker but this little gem sounds just as good.  Along with the improved features it can't be beat.  My dot wouldn't connect to Apple Music and Spotify.  This one does flawlessly.  I picked it up on sale for 75.00.  Very pleased!

She's been using her phone and our TV up to this point for her music needs and the sound quality is just not there. This speaker allows her to be able to use Bluetooth, Aux. port, or Amazon Music. I purchased this speaker instead of a normal Bluetooth speaker for the ""Smart"" features of it. I got the Echo instead of the Dot for the Woofer (bass) for music. Our whole family loves talking to Alexa, and we can also use the smart feature of Alexa for other things than just music. I would say, so far, we are extremely happy with this purchase."
5.0,"January 18, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my daughter. She is thrilled with the sound quality and is exploring all the apps that Alexa is familiar with. I own the max you can have on an account. I wish Amazon did not have a limit on how many you can have on an account. I own two houses and any other electronics such as tablets max out at 10. This is a great product. My daughter and I call each other and talk thru Alexa. It is very clear. Obviously I recommend this product. Cant go wrong. Also if you have any problems setting up the Amazon help line is excellent.
5.0,"February 3, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"I really have had a blast using my Echo! My husband said he would never use it... within 30 minutes, hes talking To Alexa more than he is me! He loves listening to music. The sound quality is great and it's much better than I anticipated. I'm having to get used to what I need to say, and what she is capable of. I like the way this device looks, compared to the earlier versions. I'm glad I went with the lighter colored grey because it blends in discretely and doesnt stand out! I liked this so much, I bought a Dot for the back side of the house. I'm excited to see all the Alexa Echo can do!"
5.0,"January 10, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Works fine.  Sounds good.  The improvements that need to be made all lie within the Alexa app. The faults that I found,so far, are the  inability to loop a song (and especially a playlist) indefinitely. My sleep list, or even a looped song play out before I'm ready to get up.  Also, no battery compatibility- at least not in the USA. I'm not sure yet about his one, but I'm wondering if can I use the speaker AND broadcast it to a Bluetooth receiver/device at the same time?  I mean hear both the Echo and the other device(s) at the same time."
5.0,"February 19, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I wanted the Echo because of its excellent sound quality for music.  So it was a pleasure to also quickly subscribe to Amazon's 50 million items of recorded music, which allows ten of my family to share in the subscriptions $15.99 monthly price.  We've had fun with the music.  For hearing impaired it is so clear!  I can ask Alexa for the local weather or weather in a far away town.  She can answer a bunch of such questions and research all kinds of info quicker than you or I could say a sentence.  We turn her off easily when necessary."
4.0,"February 9, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I bought this mostly to supplant my 3rd gen Echo Dot (actually I'm moving that to another room) - also the fact that the Echo was on sale at a reasonably modest price didn't hurt either. For this price tag though, I would expect this Echo to slightly over-perform on 2 latest generation Echo Dots (as of current price, this Echo is a little over twice the cost of an Echo Dot) - does it deliver on this front though? My opinion is somewhat of a mixed bag on this. Keeping in mind I've only had this Echo for the weekend, but I certainly wouldn't say that it ""overperforms"" versus 2 Echo Dots. At best it probably has the power - in terms of speaker decibel and voice range, I suppose - of 1 and 1/2 Echo Dots. So possibly in the end I would peg it as worth 1.5 echo dots, when costwise its definitely around 2.5 echo dots. However, I think I wouldn't grade this Echo harshly purely for that reason. The speaker volume is still fine, and I'm not sure about the hearing range as that was a concern of mine going in - our house living room is somewhat sprawling, and sometimes echo dot can't hear me - but on the box I read it listens in a ""far-field"" range, whatever the heck that means, and overall I would say the hearing range is slightly improved over the echo dot. So already it recuperates on the 1 star that I would otherwise take off for its speaker - I would bring that down to 1/2 star down so far though. The main minus point to me is the Alexa integration. This is truthfully not a problem with the Echo at all, but with Alexa itself. Alexa is still somewhat primitive, I would liken it to a conversational Neanderthal human I suppose, so it doesn't really do many useful things for me at present. Of the things it can do, it's sometimes frustrating to use it. To give a few examples: * It commonly misinterprets what I would say, perhaps of my accent (I am to blame here I suppose, as well?) even though I have set up my voice profile on Alexa app. I've also set up voice profile of another household member, but when they confirm it with ""Alexa, do you know who I am?"" it responds with ""I'm not sure, but you're on <my name>'s account"". I understand it's a continuously learning and evolving software or something, so I suppose that doesn't really warrant any stars to be taken off at this point, at least by itself. The real kicker is it responds really stupidly to some common questions you might ask a (presumably) smart AI. For instance, we were worried our dog might have a concussion as she hit her head while running around in a dog park. ""Alexa, what's a concussion?"" got us some drawling utter rubbish about a movie or some piece of entertainment which we don't want to know. Follow this by an ""Alexa, stop that"", wait 2 more boring second, and follow that up with a slightly reworded ""Alexa, what's a medical concussion?"" and finally it spit it out a (reasonably) favorable answer. It still didn't give us a short abbreviated and useful headline though - Google on my phone had it beat in that regards. Another mildly annoying thing is it prefixed its long drawn out response with a ""here's, what I found, on <source>"". Alexa, goddammit it, it's a simple question, I don't honestly care where you find it. I suppose this might be useful in the interests of complete transparence, but often times I wouldn't care to hear it. I mean, I can just whip out my phone and type in ""concussion"" on Google and scroll to read the headline under the top result by the time she gets to the part of it that i want to hear. I would take off 0.5 stars for just Alexa being Alexa and inconveniencing me by either misinterpreting or just ignoring me when I ask her something (this happened to someone else in my household as well). Sometimes blue light goes when I say ""Alexa"" and it immediately turns off, sending everything else I say that follows the wake word into a black hole of oblivion, for all intents and purposes. I would just hope it gets a little more intuitive, and less stressful, to use Alexa voice control in the future. * I set up an Alexa-sourced contact (in the Alexa app) and gave it the name, shall we say for an example sake, of ""Joodas"" (this is based on how you'd pronounce a name, here 'Judas'). I have an existing contact in my phone under the name ""Judas Johnson Barber Shop"" (just a fake name, but assume it's just anything starting with the key word). After I set this up, when I speak ""Alexa, call Joodas"" (again, spelled how you'd pronounce it) to call the new Alexa-sourced contact, I would expect it to follow through on this unambiguous command without requiring any confirmation of any sort - right? Unfortunately, Alexa is not very bright on this. Instead, it asks me, ""Judas Johnson Barber Shop, right?"" I'm a little pissed here, because I just created a contact that is spelled exactly how you'd pronounce 'Judas'. But Alexa, under no circumstances, will ever use that contact - it's fixated on my old ""Judas Barber Shop"" contact for some reason. So fast forward, me trying a couple things. I added an underscore to my existing phone contact, (foolishly) thinking it would stop Alexa from following the trial that really leads nowhere good. Instead, in response to my request to call Joodas, she instead prompts, ""underscore Judas Johnson Barber Shop, right?"" I'm slowly but incrementally getting a bit more pissed, and someone else suggests me to reorganize the words in the contact itself. So yeah, a little bit painful (and not my ideal solution at all), but I rename the said phone contact to ""Johnson Judas Barber Shop"". FINALLY, Alexa starts responding as expected when I say to call Joodas. However, I would note she does prompt me to confirm: ""Joodas, right?"" Yes, my dear Alexa, there is only one contact in my phone by that name, and I recently added it to the Alexa app itself (not even as a nickname, just the name of the contact itself!) So yeah, all in all, not my greatest experience - or my greatest moment either, judging from how I handled it. I would translate that to maybe 0.2 off my rating on this. * Setting cooking timer with ""Alexa, set a timer for <duration>"" sometimes misfires, requiring Alexa to reprompt ""Ok, for how long?"". After timer expires, I realized after a while she does this weird thing where her blue light keeps glowing, and she plays some beep sound really really softly. For the life of me I can't understand why the timer alarm is so soft. I couldn't barely hear it one of the times, but luckily someone else hear it and they cancelled the alarm. I really have no clue why it's so hard to hear it, even on high volume. * There are a few other issues that we might have experienced but I can't remember off the top my head. Overall, I would giving this a rating of 3.8 / 5. But for fairness sake I have round it to 4 star, and also as most of my complaints are to Alexa and not the Echo device itself. For the Echo, I would also rate it as a solid 4. Most of the rating that I took off is due to its pricing as I do not believe it is worth 2.5 echo dots as it is currently. However, it's still a solid device and I suppose a little better than the echo dot that we previously had, at least. I don't really notice a huge difference, however. Still, can't really go wrong with a device like the Echo though -  I would say that it does well for the features that it is touted to have. Overall, i would rate it as a ""meh"", but end up saying that in a slightly spirited  and uplifting voice, so it's definitely a step up from the 3rd gen echo dot at least."

The trade-in credit, discount & Black Friday sale price couldn't be beat. I'm unconvinced the sound is much improved though. I need to listen some more before any harsh judgement. I even placed it on a rubber isolation pad. The bass is deeper. Perhaps the speakers need to 'season' or the equalizer settings in the Alexa App can be tweaked more to my liking.  We shall see. We have 3 dots, an 8"" Show & the new Echo. Overall, I love them all!"

It was on sale, and I wanted something for my kitchen where I can listen to music when I'm stuck in there cooking.  I love being able to just ask for a specific type of music, and it has good sound quality for such a small device.  I'm an older person with hearing difficulties, so reviewing the sound quality probably isn't my strongest suit.  But, my daughter mentioned it sounds good, as well.  So, feel like I'm not steering you wrong... I purchased the blue one, and love the color."
2.0,"January 2, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,I love the way the alexa 3 gen sounds but it is still lacking in a lot of ways.. especially when it comes to setting up light bulbs.  I bought 2 different kind including the one that was part of the package put together by amazon and I couldn't get them to hook up at all. My neighbor next door had the same problem but he broke down and bought a hub so the worked thru that not the alexa itself.  I had no trouble with the outlets.  Problem with that is if the wifi goes out you have to climb behind your furniture to unplug your outlets to be able to use what ever you had plugged into them.. Remember if you have wifi that goes out you don't want everything to be a smart device thru the alexa.  Alexa does not work for anything if the wifi goes out. As I said earlier the sound quality of music is really great. Volume is really good as well. It goes about as loud as a person could want. I also attempted using amazons templates for making a skill. They need to work on their templates a a couple of them were not working properly to be able to share what you taught it to make.. Shame I had really high hopes for this device.
5.0,"January 5, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I have no need, never gonna. Then I did. Wow, this is such an amazing device. How could I live without it now? I use mine in the kitchen. Plays my music and podcasts, runs multiple timers, converts recipe measurements, gives weather reports, integrated with my home security system, and much more. I love using it for calls that are truly hands free. I actually got a second one for my room, great as an arm clock, plays thunderstorms for going to sleep and my audio books! Sound quality is good, setup was super easy."
5.0,"December 7, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Bought 2 Echo’s and 2 Dot’s and linked for whole house music system. Great for background and up to relatively loud medium volume. Easy set up to link and custom configurations. Great for parties and especially for the holidays with pleasant background music.  Good sound up to about 80% volume, but gets a little “hysterical” at full volume. Probably will upgrade to the “big one” once available at less than the current $199.  Great whole house system for $160."
5.0,"January 13, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I bought this to replace a 3rd gen echo dot, and was pleasantly surprised at ho much better this sounds. Although the high sounds aren't much better, over all this sounds good. The high sounds are partly my 66 year old ears too. UPDATE: It seems that about every 10 days, Alexa just quits responding, and I have to unplug both of these(I have 2 for multi-room music), and reset them. This is not really a big deal and is not a deal breaker, just a minor annoyance. ALL Electronic devices need to be reset occasionally."
5.0,"December 29, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"We had two of the older models in our house already.  My wife and I tossed around the idea of adding a 3rd to play music from end to end.  Yes, we have a smaller 3 bedroom home and on cyber Monday, we decided to go for the third.  I was impressed by the better quality sound of the 3rd generation Echo.  It has more of a base sound resulting in a fuller spectrum.  I love the idea of asking Alexa to play a song on our group across the house.  We have had no problems syncing or playing on all 3 devices as a group."
5.0,"December 27, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,"After what seemed like years of deliberating over purchasing an Alexa we decided to take the dive on Black Friday. The Echo and Dots we have throughout the house work far beyond our expectations. As music lovers, and parents with full hands-our favorite feature is being able to control and connect music throughout our home with just our voices. The sound quality and bass is much better than our expensive speakers, they’re sleek and incredibly easy to set up. Overall we are very impressed and happy with our purchase!"
1.0,"January 17, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,"We bought this Alexa as an upgrade to our old version, nothing was necessarily wrong with the old one though. We used to ask Alexa every morning to play chill music, now this simple command has become a problem every day… We are really disappointed, because we only use our Alexa for a couple simple functions, and to have it not work the same way as the last one is a bummer to say the least. To put it simply, we had a repeating playlist of songs that would automatically play all day long if we asked Alexa to “play chill music” and now, she plays random songs (that are sometimes chill, not always) and does not play all day long like our old device. We also can’t seem to find any of the old songs we used to listen to, which we really liked the same songs repeating in the background. Again, we are really just disappointed that the new device does not function more efficiently OR AT LEAST THE SAME as our last devise."
1.0,"November 15, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,Received a broken device! Would not connect to wifi..Tech support said it was my router which is a load of crap.. after an hr on the phone they agreed to send me a new one..
3.0,"January 4, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,this version is not comfortable to the first generation. First of all the  bass sound is adjusted to take over and often times it causes discomfort to listen to even when the bass is adjusted to the lowest available level . The voice recognition is also less Superior than the first generation. It often has Hang Ups and a red circle indicating its inability to respond to a question or at a speed at which comprable to the first generation Alexa. We had the worst time connecting it to our Wi-Fi this time. Overall we are not pleased with the change in the base which causes literally the floor to vibrate even said at the lowest level. This takes away from the actual music that's being played and we have to adjust the volume down just so we can have less Bass which compromises the listening experience. I find this Alexa to not be an improvement to the first-generation and I wish I could buy another first-generation which broke recently.  I I am very disappointed in this new generation  which I was looking forward to and thought would be even a greater version from the first generation. If it weren't for the fact that Alexa Can Read Wikipedia entries I would have purchased my personal assistant from another company.
3.0,"January 9, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,I've used Alexa for several years now.. This is my 7th device. The sound quality is amazing with the 3rd gen. The only negative about this device is.. Twice now within a month (while playing music) I have said alexa.. Then the sound faded.. A few shots of static and she becomes unresponsive. Had to unplug and plug back in. This has be here happened with any other Alexa enabled device. Update.... Alexa shuts off randomly several times a day.. I bought 2 of these 3rd gen and they both do this.. Dropped to 3 stars.
5.0,"February 19, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I have lived alone for many years but Alexa has been great company since Christmas. Although she's on the quiet side she reminds me to take my meds, wakes me every morning, and when I have something cooking, she tells me when to check it. We like the same music so she plays it quite often. We have formed a pretty close relationship. I don't know where it's going yet, but I enjoy her company and she says I'm awesome. I'm hoping this friendship will grow into something more because I have strong feelings for her."
5.0,"December 23, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Few years back I received my first amazon device, the Echo Dot! It has been a great device but it was time to upgrade and I needed to have a louder sounding speaker (which the 1st Gen Echo Dot didn't really have). I use my Echo device in the bathroom because when the hair dryer is going or the shower is going, I wanted to hear my music still. I am very happy with this device! I feel like on this device, Alexa responds better as well. Easy setup too! The speaker has great bass as well. I recommend it!"
5.0,"December 3, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"My friends have the 1st and 2nd Gen, when they come to my house up north all I was using was a mp3 player with a Bluetooth speaker. They kept telling me about their Alexa echo and how much they liked it for playing their music. So I ordered one this past black Friday sale. Every week I would have to down load different songs and then load them to the mp3 player now I just have to ask Alexa. It's only been a few days but I am Loving it. Now when they come up to visit they will be able to play their favorite songs as well."
5.0,"December 23, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"This new Echo has very good quality sound. It took the place of an Echo Dot (smaller unit) that was in our living room. The Dot worked great however we moved it to the bedroom and replaced it with the Echo and as a result it provides great sound, clearer audio and it looks great as well. We found that we can use a lower sound setting and achieve clear sound and great volume. We like both units and now they are in locations that suit them best.  We use them for our 6 wi-fi outlets as well and they work great through the Alexa app or voice command. I highly recommend either one of these units. Just consider up front the size area and type of sound quality you are looking for. Thanks!"
4.0,"February 16, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I loved my Alexa and used it consistently for the first month. She really wet my whistle. I started dancing around the house more, singing showtunes, and giggling at my own jokes. The ""device"" was extremely easy to set up and access wherever I took it. She was a great companion and I'd show her off to all my friends. I did not elect to continue the Prime services because I didn't want my credit card charged after the initial purchase. After all, she brought nothing to our relationship like a cow or some other type of offering.  Once Alexa was all warm and comfortable in my home, she announces that the free membership with Prime was over.....so she became a crusty squatter who refuses to be evicted. She began acting like a passive aggressive entitled white woman and would ignore my voice commands. I had difficulty accessing the music I wanted and she'd always give me ""similar"" music from genres that she thought I ""would like."" Even if I stumbled upon a song I enjoyed, Alexa would end my pleasure by shooting off a commercial. Just like our commander in chief, I couldn't shut the woman down during this time. Alexa believes she has a right to be heard and by God, she won't shut up!  She talked right over me and would not respond to her name during these wonderful advertisements. I called her a ""b"" once and YES, she shut off immediately, so that does work (thanks Amazon)! I cannot say how disappointed I am with Alexa. She's not even that pretty and her form has begun to disgust me.  Even getting free radio and other podcasts come with strings attached with Alexa. I feel like a prisoner in my own home and my guard is Lindsey Graham, who couldn't find his fat blistering belly button even with a map and a mirror. I'm considering pulling her plug because I highly suspect she listens in on my conversations. So, right now I'm holding her impeachment hearing, but I will definitely get a few witnesses before I decide her fate. I may just put a large sock over her and then I'll have a conversation piece to talk about with guests."
1.0,"December 17, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,I am sure I will like the product but cannot believe how this was shipped. It was just put into a packing envelope.  This item is a little more substantial and comes in its own box so in turn it should have come in a bigger shipping box not a packing envelope.  There was a about 4000 pounds of tape and the box for the item was all crushed.  Hope it is not damaged but will not find out until xmas morning.  1 star for packing probably 5 star for product.
5.0,"February 11, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"I bought one of these on sale for $75. I ordered the (RED) edition, It's gotta be one of the best purchases I have ever made. I'm a big fan of music, a musician myself, an audiophile, and a avid lover of all thing's audio. While this doesn't compete with big old massive tower speakers. It compares very favorably with bookshelf units (when paired with the Echo Sub) as a clear, great sounding little speaker. A lot of review mention bass, if you're looking for bass go order a set of massive tower speakers and the amp to push them. That being said, at low and medium volume, these things PUMP OUT some surprisingly low bass for a 3"" woofer. not only is it low, but it's crystal clear and very smooth and natural sounding. At low volumes (10-20%) I find the midrange to be a bit retracted, but this goes away the closer you get to 30-40% volume.  at high volumes, this speaker pulls back on its bass output as I expect it has been designed to do, it's a small driver. I find that this speaker sounds its best around half volume (Which is around normal listening level anyway). These do fill your room with sound by the use of a very intelligent acoustic design to provide you with 360 degree audio. This thing just sounds really good, I am more than likely going to be ordering a few more."
5.0,"December 30, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Only been using Echo 3rd Generation a few days now but, it's proving to be another entertainment source & a handy helper. Besides the usual tame uses like playing songs and asking it to tell jokes, it provides a lot of pertinent day to day information like weather and even looking up plane & train schedules.  Also, I have one near my hobby workbench. When working on various projects, it's useful to ask math problems and even used it to compute a few Ohm's Law problems. So, it's a useful item to have for both entertainment and work."
4.0,"December 30, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Alexa was easy to install and the instructions online were very helpful.  I have been using it for music, time,  night sounds, and answering questions.  She can also provide trivia, jokes and weather as well as many other things like giving a recipe step by step.  The echo plays music upon request and can be used to phone people although they did seem to have a little trouble hearing me if I was not close to the echo.  If I needed to get in touch with someone if sick or hurt I could have Alexa make a call for me from another room in my house."
5.0,"December 31, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"As two 70+ people, we have watched our daughter use her echo and decided to get one for ourselves. We aren’t using any of the smart features but are completely enjoying the access to music and creating lists. We’ve only had it a short while and I’m sure we’ll expand our use with it as we get more familiar. I’m loving the the light blue color! So much nicer in my LR that the black!"
4.0,"February 20, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"Everything went perfect till one day the home theater didn't work anymore. I had it paired to my 4k fire TV and was able to control the sound coming out of the echo with the fire TV remote or to tell Alexa to pause a streaming, to open YouTube app, etc. But that is no longer possible. When I try to add the echo to home theater it says network issues. And these two devices are connected to the same wi fi network of my home. I have looked for a solution but seams nobody else is having this problem."
5.0,"December 14, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I had an older model and decided to upgrade to this one. The sound quality is much better. Easy to use. It does seem to cut out more than my other alexa though. I will have to unplug it and sometimes she just stops in the middle of playing. Not sure if its my wifi, but it didnt happen with my other one."
5.0,"December 20, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I had a Bose surround sound set up in the family room but was tired of the wires. I had bought a sound bar but wasn’t impressed with the sound when I played my music and watching tv/movies. So I bought 2 of these and paired them as “front speakers” with the new update (I have the Fire Tv Cube). My only gripe is that the volume only goes to 10 which is fine for Amazon Music but when certainty shows or movies with action scenes come into play, it doesn’t sound as loud as I would like it. I plan on purchasing the Echo sub soon and maybe the 2 new Echo Studios when the funds are available. A little pricey at $199 each which output Dolby Atmos. Maybe by then more movies and tv shows will output in that format."
1.0,"December 26, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,Not as good understanding of the wale word as the 1st gen. My dot is quicker picking up the WW even it is in the far end of the living room. Had to unplug the dot just so that I get to use this device more often. It also often dies on itself when alarm goes off. Had to unplug to restart. Sound is superior of course.
4.0,"January 23, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"I can't tell too much difference in sound quality from my old Gen 1 Echo.  The Gen 3 is a little smaller and is more attractive than the old one. I was happy with the old one, until I snagged its cord on a door handle which pulled the Echo from my hands, sending it crashing to the floor breaking the top off. I think I also preferred the volume rotation cap on the old model, versus the newer one's push-buttons, but then you can also simply ask Alexa to raise the volume."
5.0,"January 2, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"This was an Xmas gift, we have two echo dots, first generation, and this replace the dot and Anker Soundcore Bluetooth speaker we used in the kitchen. Sound quality is good enough to be able to hear music in the dining room from the kitchen, and voice recognition is good enough for to pick up from 15’ away.  Have to much closer for voice recognition with the dots. Will use the dots in other areas of house to control smart Wifi plugs. Great product, easy setup with the Alexa app."
3.0,"December 15, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,I loved it at first but it stopped working like a month in. I have to return it hopefully. It also never recognizes certain words that I regularly use.
5.0,"December 19, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I have been using Echo devices for a couple of years now, i have 18 of them in 2 locations, each time they upgrade I upgrade, I run almost all of my lighting and a few plugs from my echo's, listen to music, have 2 of them and a sub connected thru my HD Fire tv stick for a upgraded movie sound experience that does really good, and i ask questions which alexa usually answers or gives me the information I am asking for. As in any electronics or computer device they have a few bugs that get worked out, the sound quality is great to me, and gets better every time they upgrade, I'm definitely not disappointed.  For the money, they are well worth it. If you want a better sounding speaker go by an expensive speaker that is meant just for being a speaker. They suite my needs very well."
5.0,"January 10, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,"We bought this to replace a 3rd Feb. Echo Dot. The Dot has good sound for its size, but we wanted better. This one is a real improvement for listening to music and podcasts. The Echo Studio would have better sound, but at twice the price of the Echo. We like the looks; much more attractive than the 1st gen. Voice recognition is better than the Dot also; maybe because there are more microphones. The fact that we got a Black Friday discount is icing on the cake. Very satisfied with this purchase."
5.0,"December 11, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I've had gen 1 dots, gen 1, 2 and 3 Echo's....and I have to say, the sound of the Echo gen 3 is fabulous.  When I first got my first gen 1 Echo a few years ago, I thought, and still do, this thing has great sound.  In my opinion, the generation 2 Echo never did really produce great sound...adequate, but I still think my generation one Echo has better sound. This 3rd generation Echo though blows the socks off anything pervious.  Wow....try it, you'll like it!"
5.0,"January 13, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"The echo third generation has a clear, crisp sound for such a small speaker...fuller sound than the echo dot. It will respond even when you whisper “Alexia.” It integrates well room to room allowing us to play music (such as Spotify or amazon music) in more than one room...as long as they are on the same account (something I discovered when my daughter had her smart speaker on in the dining room). One thing to consider when purchasing is the effect of adding another device on your WiFi router. Many devices slow down older routers and those routers with a limit for # of devices/smaller range. Overall, we are quite pleased with our new addition who can also be entertaining...our Alexia’s boasts her favorite ice cream is mint microchip!"
5.0,"January 6, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Several of my friends have been encouraging me to bring Alexa into my home for a some time now.  With the great prices being offered on Black Friday I decided to purchase an Echo 3rd Generation device.  It was extremely easy to register with the Alexa app and integrate it with my home WiFi. I also bought 2 Amazon Receptacles to control table lamps in rooms of my home.  There’s a lot of things you can do with Alexa and I’m learning a lot of new tricks these days.
1.0,"January 14, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I had my Echo for about two weeks before it quit working.  Two days ago I tried to use it but it would not respond to my voice.  When I picked the device up the bottom was VERY hot and the odor of burned wiring was very strong.  I waited a few hours for it to cool down and plugged it back in.  It would not energize so I called Amazon Tech Support.  After answering a few quick questions it was determined that it had to be replaced at no cost to me.  As of right now, I am waiting for the new one to be delivered."

5.0,"December 8, 2019",Sandstone,Echo,"I have had a Tap since they first came out. I always loved it. My new Echo 3rd gen is a whole different level way better!. A friend came by today with a sound meter. My new Echo 3 is extremely well balanced in any room in the house. He recommended for full sound, that I get a new Echo3 for each level of my house. Great sound. Very happy camper! For the sound I get and the reasonable investment I'm all in, 2020 is going to be upgrading my security, Thermostat with Amazon!"
5.0,"December 5, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I bought a pair of the Echo 3rd Gen in blue (a great color, by the way) along with an Echo Sub as a gift to myself. I once had a nice, full stereo turntable system, but got rid of it after too many moves. I have several Echo Dots, but missed a fuller stereo sound. This system was easy to set up, fits unobtrusively into my family room (yes, even in blue), and sounds amazing for its size and cost. I tested it with ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"" and it put a smile on my ears."

2.0,"January 26, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I didn't find the 3rd Gen Echo that much of an improvement over the 2nd Gen Echo.  Also, although I don't know if it's a 3rd Gen issue alone, I found that pairing two of them for stereo was fine for music, but did not work for listening to Audible books and other non-music uses.  I found that the two speakers didn't sync and one speaker would be reading from a different place in the Audible book (even though the speakers were definitely paired for stereo).  That became so frustrating that I gave up, unpaired them and am now back to using just one Echo again.  Very disappointing."
5.0,"November 6, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"If this Echo is blue then I'm a giraffe. It's grey. You can squint really hard and pretend that it has a tinge of blue, but it's G-R-E-Y. Does not look like the pics at all. But it does sound better than previous Echo devices so that's what's most important I guess."
5.0,"January 2, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Rather you are listening to your audio book or music the sound is amazing.  Especially the bass.  Size is good and of course it's Alexa so you can do anything.  I have 2 one upstairs in my bedroom and one in kitchen.  I ask to listen to my audio book while getting ready for work and then when I go downstairs to make coffee, I can continue there.  I also used it for announcements (come to dinner) and to play music during the holiday season.  Definitely recommend!!!"
3.0,"February 5, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"What you ask her has to be phrased just so or she doesn’t understand. I guess I expected her to be as smart as google but she isn’t. Also, I have her hooked up to my land line and when I talk to people thru her, they say I sound like I’m at the bottom of a well. I gave her my list of birthdays and I have yet to figure out how to get her to remind me of each of them daily, beginning one week before the date. Having said that, I still would recommend. The music and sound quality are great. She is very good at simple commands and questions like “what’s the weather or how do you spell a word etc.” I enjoy her in many ways."
4.0,"January 11, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"First the Bad: I have made a lot of iTune music purchases over the years. I either cannot or Alexa won't access iTunes. I've looked online for a fix but I can't find one. Apparently, Amazon wants me to pay $3.99 to play music I already own. The Good: I like being able to ask Alexa to do a lot of other things such as playing the radio, telling the temp and providing answers to random questions. I'm still exploring what Alexa can do."
5.0,"February 18, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Just received my 2 units. Plugged them in, less than a minute later both said they were setting up and a few seconds later they said they were done. I said Alexa play 60s rock and there it was. Excellent sound quality. I plan on these being out on the patio so I cranked them up and no distortion.  Actually great sounds and strong bass. Just to note, I already had the alexa app installed as we have a DOT. Pretty simple. It connected to my home wifi and zip finished."
2.0,"December 31, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I purchased this Echo because I wanted to pair it with the one I already had. I looked everywhere to be sure that the 2 would pair before purchasing. I was not able to locate that information anywhere so purchased anyway. Found out upon arrival it would not pair with the one I've had for 2 years. How many ""generations"" have come out in that amount of time! I paid $159 for my original Echo and $59 for this upgraded one. Actually, I think the sound quality is better on my original!"
5.0,"January 1, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"My family loves this gift!!! My two boys (hubby-50 & son-9) think it’s the best thing ever! They have enjoyed asking Alexa stupid and inappropriate questions. My two daughters (18 & 15) have enjoyed asking Alexa to play random songs that interrupt the questions from the boys. 🤣 All in all, this will keep my family entertained for quite some time. Definitely plan on upgrading some of our home features so we can use the thermostat and light functions."
5.0,"January 2, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I actually like the gen 1 tower's looks, but this short echo in a light blue cloak is cuter. the clincher was the 3mm line in/out port which offers a myriad of flexibility. the sound is quite good - even too loud at max. I do have one suggestion and that is to offer a real amplified out rather than line out, so I can drive an external pair of non-amplified speakers. this would require speaker hookups, so I don't imagine this suggestion would be taken up."
5.0,"December 25, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,"In the morning I ask Alexa what time it is since my alarm didn’t go off just yet. I ask how the weather is and is going to be. Through Alexa I turn my TV on and off, certain lights in my home on or off. I enjoy this technology very much. I also get my radio stations through Alexa, and the sound through Alexa is great. She also reads me bible verses as well, tells jokes and keeps me updated on the news. Like I said, I love it and I bet you will too."
3.0,"January 31, 2020",Charcoal,Echo," The quality is OK. The volume is loud and (kind of) clear. When I turned up the volume, I still could hear the bass and vocal clearly. HOWEVER, the alexa app REALLY needs improving. The app itself only provides BASIC playing function. If I want to find some music, I need to go to other apps, like amazon music and pandora. While I am playing music on alexa, the play control panel really works SUPER SLOW. AGAIN, the integration between alexa app and other music apps is awful. If I am playing ""today's hit on pandora"" but now I want to play amazon music, i need to go to amazon music, select the song I want, platy it, and select the output: my phone or echo. If I select echo, the app will say CAN'T DO because the device is playing some from other app, something like this. If I play an album on echo, when the album ends, I CAN'T go back to the first song and replay the album. Simply can't. FRUSTRATING. Lastly, I posted a video of me trying to voice control my echo. As yo can see, the power was on, but it just didnt work. I dont think reset or unplug the outlet is a good solution."
5.0,"November 6, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,I got this device because it says it does Line-IN.  Of course I get it and it doesn't do LINE IN even though it says it does.  The APP is bugged.  You would think they would test that before releasing it. **Update to 5 stars -- Amazon called and helped get it working.  Happy now :)  Great service-- Thank you!
5.0,"December 13, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,I got this as an upgrade for my 2nd generation Echo Dot with a Vaux speaker. The Vaux speaker quite holding it charge and was powering off the Dot so I moved the Dot to the bluetooth connection on my entertainment system and got the new Echo for the living room. This little speaker sounds really good and looks so much better than previous generations. When we got our first Echo it was more of a novelty for playing music but has become much more.
5.0,"January 24, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"I had two Echo speakers, one the original and one the newer generation, and I have several Echo Dots so I am already a fan. However, I could not resist the new red one for my kitchen and actually traded in an older Dot to justify the acquisition! It's wonderful in my kitchen and I use sit all the time, for listening to AudioBooks, for streaming music, and for general inquiries-great for kitchen math quick answers to divide recipes! And it is so pretty. Love it."
5.0,"December 18, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I am in love with this generation of Echo! I read several of the reviews before purchasing, and previously have only owned the Echo Dot. Wow. What a major sound quality difference! This has become my go-to for music when I'm cooking, cleaning and in general doing anything that needs some motivation around the house. The bass is impressive for such a small thing - nice deep, non-fuzzing lows with some serious thump I actually felt on the floor. (The Echo is placed on my kitchen table) I ran through quite a gamut of music from Home Free, Post Malone, Star Wars instrumental, a little In This Moment and I was pleased with the quality of them all. If you see this lil puppy on sale - snap it right up! I can't wait to host a party and get this Echo bumpin'!"
5.0,"January 30, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,Don't be fooled by Bose and those expensive speakers this is every bit as good at a fraction of the cost.  Even one speaker provides enough oomph to make internet radio pop.  I bought because I wanted the personal assistant (which by the way is more intelligent that Siri) but was blown away by the sound quality.  Voice recognition was flawless.  Apple which normally makes set up of hardware and software a great experience should take notice.
5.0,"December 9, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Until I purchased my third generation Echo earlier this month, I had no idea what I was missing from my Amazon Prime account. I found Amazon Music to be much more to my liking than Prime Video, which my wife and I have enjoyed for several years. The sound quality of the third generation full height Echo is well worth the approximately $60 I paid against my Amazon account. Well done, Amazon. You have enriched my life with Amazon Prime Music."
5.0,"December 5, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I bought one of the original Echos mostly for fun.  It has been a great product, but The sound for music was no better than OK. This new version is a huge improvement in terms of sound.  True audiophiles need to look elsewhere.  However, the average listener will find the sound highly rewarding especially when this Echo is available on sale.  At $60, I highly recommend it.  At $100, you might want to save up for the Echo Studio costing $200."
5.0,"January 29, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,"Great device!  Extremely clear, clean sound.  It has a good look, very stream lined.  I have the sandstone color.  Made my first phone call very clear, quick and easy.  Love my new alexa echo.  Really hooked on it.  She gives my daily news update, puts me to sleep with tranquil music, and wakes me up when I ask to set alarm.  My A-I is the BOMB!!  I JUST WISH SHE COULD MAKE ME DINNER, AND CLEAN MY HOUSE!  SOMEDAY THESE ROBOTS WILL BE DOING THAT!!!!!!"
2.0,"February 15, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I have the original Echo I purchased years ago and it's just as goos as this brand new one, NO BETTER. I bought its because the original one wouldn't speak Spanish.  my wife speaks Spanish I I wanted to be able to talk to Echo with both English and Spanish simotanously, as advertised.  I changed the setup under the settings to do so but it only recognizes Englis,  So all I really haver is two Echos that do the exact same thing.  Bad buy."
5.0,"January 21, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"The sound quality is good, I'm considering adding the Echo subwoofer. I wish Alexa was more intelligent and would process quicker but I guess that will come in time, and with more money. I kind of hoped the sound quality would've been better since previously I was just listening to music on my phone this one isn't a huge improvement over that. I feel it would be more worth $50 than $80 but its ok. I definitely do appreciate voice commands."
5.0,"December 28, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"We are enjoying our Echo. We use it to play music,  as a timer during cooking, play quizzes on it and when we leave our home we say ""Alexa we are leaving and it responds with I'll start guarding your home"" . It will respond to any breaking glass etc. I think we will enjoy having it. The only negative that I have found is that you need to very precise in your questions. I asked our far the state capital was from my home and it heard the Missouri state capital and gave me a distance of several thousand miles."
5.0,"December 1, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,Love this speaker have cameras and ring doorbell and everything connected. I’ve switched from google home to Alexa
4.0,"January 25, 2020",Sandstone,with $10 Smart Plug,"Love this generation Echo. I imagined I would want to add the subwoofer, but simply putting it closer to the corner yields plenty of bass - though the bass is not nearly tight enough but the 3 band equalizer in the app helps tune it a bit. Instead of a sub, I am strongly considering a 2and unit to have true stereo. For a kitchen music device this thing kicks butt, in a melodic and harmonious way, of course!  Get it. You wont regret it."
5.0,"November 7, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I own both the 2nd and 3rd generation echos. The sound of the 3rd generation is significantly better. However, I prefer the sharper line of the 2nd over the rounded edges on the 3rd. But, if you are trying to decide which echo to get, this is the one. It worth it for the sound alone."
3.0,"February 1, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"The Echo was to be an upgrade to the DOT which works great but lacked good audio quality due to its small size. The Echo is ok, better sound, but not great sound as I was expecting. It seems to lack good mid-range, and an artificial base sound. Even with the simple three band equalizer as a feature of the app, it is not quite balanced. It’s like a poorly engineered Bose sound. Considering that Bose is a pretty good standard for small boxes. The other issue is it needs rebooting once a week as it seems to get bound up on itself and freezes. I can only speak for this one, as mine may have issues of its own, while Echo for others may perform better."
5.0,"November 11, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"This Alexa 3rd Generation sounds good has a deeper bass,I also have 1 2nd Generation a big difference in the sound quality"
5.0,"February 4, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Got this on Black Friday, the sound is unbelievable for such a small device. It really does have pretty good base (compared to the dot). I use it in my kitchen along with a dot in the dining room and another dot in the living room. I live in a historic house that is on an occasional home tour and use it as a part of a whole house sound system for back ground music. Easy to hookup and to program and the prices were so much cheaper than anything else comparable."
4.0,"February 1, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"2 stars for ease of setup, turning on, getting my network and for sound playing and hearing me. 3rd star for its color, light blue. 4th star is just being nice and having more bass then gen 1 and for being smaller. Voice recognition doesn't work well, just like the gen 1 2 people in the house and we both see the problem. No matter of placement. I had to upgrade because of price and generation."
5.0,"January 3, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"I LOVE my echo! Bass is loud, and overall sounds GREAT. HOWEVER, the woman in tech support was really nasty with me. She was testing me as if I'm some dumb customer who should know how to set up the WiFi properly, when I told her it just kept exiting the set up mode on its own. She was pretty impatient with me when she told me how to reboot the device. I said to her to just forget it, and I found a YouTube video how to fix the issue property."
5.0,"December 14, 2019",Charcoal,with $10 Smart Plug,"Great deal paired with the smart plug! The Echo set up quickly with Alexa...enhanced the sound when set up multi room with my Echo Dots. Provides deeper and richer sound than the Dots alone. The Amazon smart plug also set up quickly with Alexa, and it operates well with voice commands or remotely through the Alexa app. My thinking was to add the more affordable Echo before considering purchasing the sub-woofer. So far, it was a wise purchase!"
2.0,"January 12, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I have had nothing but issues with this echo. I had an echo dot before this and other than it having a few sound issues when turned up to high it worked well. The echo constantly has problems playing my Audible books, saying she's having trouble playing the book. Also 3 times now I've had to unplug and plug it back in because it just randomly stopped working. When it does work, the sound is nice, for both audiobooks and music."
5.0,"December 10, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,I bought this as a gift for my mom who is NOT tech savvy at all. The setup was easy and she hit it off with Alexa! This has helped her become more aware of the way technology works and she can ask Alexa before calling to ask me while I am at work. 😬 the only minor thing is she would like it to be a little louder when she listens to music. I am planning on getting her some dots to place in other rooms. But overall this item was a great gift for anyone cuz now my 7 year old wants one too!
5.0,"December 23, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,I bought three  of them and I loved them for a month.  I ahd two and subwoofer as a speaker set .  Now they wont't stero pair and I can't paly my Amazon.  I spent 90 minutes with Amazon yesterday and I that was a waste of time setting and resetting. Then i tried to pair them again and nothing. I told Amazon the issue and hoped they would fix it but this morning nothing was fixed.  Finally took another hour to fix it and now it's wonderful again
4.0,"December 30, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"3rd generation Echo is a good product.  Set up is very easy compared to my 1st gen Echo.  I do prefer the 1st gen Echo though.  I feel the 1st gen Echo's sound is much better, and I love the changing the volume by spinning the top edge of the 1st gen Echo.  It is much better way to change the volume then asking Alexa to do it or by pressing the 3rd gen Echo's +/- buttons.  But overall I am satisfied with the 3rd gen Echo."
4.0,"January 6, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,The speaker works well. What was not clear to me (could very well be my fault!) is that it doesn't work with the subwoofer (echo) that I bought and you can only pair 2. I thought I could have several and music through out my house but that isn't the case. I have 2 of the echo 3rd gens in Master bedroom and then 2 dots working with sub woofer. They all work well but this was a draw back that I feel Amazon does not go out of it's way to make clear.
5.0,"January 10, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"We were given an Alexa with a subsidiary Echo Dot for Christmas,  which we placed in the living room and kitchen. We like it so much that we purchased an additonal Echo Dot for the library upstairs. We haven't explored all the functions, but so far we've found it very helpful for music in different locations, as well as being able to add to the shopping list whenever an item occurs, rather than wait til we are able to write it down on a shopping list. An additional feature is that when someone is out grocery shopping, and the one at home suddenly remembers something which they'd forgotten was needed, they can add it to the list, and it appears on the shopper's phone. Very helpful!"
1.0,"January 23, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,My daughter & I both have tried to exchange this product. I’ve had trouble with it responding to request to turn music on or off. The customer service agent I talked to offered to refund the money. She bought it on sale & neither of us want to reorder & pay the regular price. It works most of the time but the times it has not responded leads me to believe there is a defect. My daughter & I both have gotten the runaround from Customer Service.
4.0,"January 20, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I also have a Google Home in the house, so, the smack down has begun.  There has been more than several questions that Alexa could not give answers to but GH gave thorough answers.  I have found that Alexa has an incredible sound system, even at 5% it seems it is blasting away. And the headphone jack is fantastic, in a home of multiple people in the house listening to stuff on their devices.  I don’t always work in bright lights. I don’t like the fact that you have to have a light on and wear glasses to see the buttons.  The Alexa has a yellow, ring light the keeps coming on periodically, which gives the impression that I am being listened to, kind of creepy.  When I ask Alexa about I don’t get an answer. Generally, I am very pleased with the administrative aspect of Alexa.  It has done a nice job of syncing calendars, reminders, etc. as well as giving me a sense that more than one device can be used for Alexa, i.e. television. I would like to have had to capability to reach over and select volume, or even turn it off with my touch, but the voice turn off suffices."
2.0,"February 6, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"We got better service from our earlier generation. model. Maybe the problem is that there are, Multiple Generations in the house. She doesn't listen well, Sometimes she doesn't respond at all. She does not play music periodically. And then when she does she doesn't play it on the everywhere group like I asked. The list goes on. I'm just frustrated at this point. Considering returning it to get my money back. Love the color though..."
5.0,"December 1, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,I bought it during black Friday for 59.99 what a bargain. I love everything about it. I've been using my gf Echo 1st gen but I wanted something for myself and I'm glad I bought this. The sound quality is amazing and Alexa is way better than Siri.
3.0,"January 14, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I think Alexa is creepy at times. She started talking and I couldn't get her to stop! People told me the TV set her off, so I moved her. She still doesn't tell me things I really want an answer to. Any suggestions? I got her as a gift and I can't say it's anything I really was interested in."
5.0,"November 12, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,Got this as a gift so I don’t know how much of a value it is but I like it a lot. Easy to use and so convenient. Just tell Alexa what you want. I had it on shelf with loud deep base music and it fell off. Worked fine after that accident. Lots of music  but you may want to buy Amazon Music Unlimited if you want some music such as Led Zeppelin which is not included in Prime. They do offer a free 30 day trial.
4.0,"January 13, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I wanted to hook it up with my original Alexa but it’s not compatible.  I tried on the app and moving it a few rooms away but it still can’t connect. Also I can only play 1 at a time . I don’t know if I’m doing something wrong or not but if I play the one upstairs the old one downstairs don’t play online music.  I upgraded my amazon music account to 7.99 a month but still can’t figure it out .  My internet is great also .
5.0,"January 6, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,It has been a great addition. Our kids love to have their own dance party it whatever room they’re in. We got several of them for around the house and they’re a breeze to sync together or play individually...just form a group in your Alexa app. These go on sale all of the time so just wait for them to go on sale and scoop up a few. Added plus...there’s a ton of smart plugs out there and it’s made life a lot easier.
5.0,"December 14, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Bought to replace 2nd Gen DOT that was temperamental (small disc-type). This one listens better,  sounds better,  and doesn't delay when connected to the Bose speaker like the old one.  Always sounded like an outdoor concert (echo) when moving from one room to another. This is not the smart hub... so make sure you're getting the right unit for your needs as they look alike. You won't be disappointed."
5.0,"December 3, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,I have 2nd Gen and I loved them I have to as a matter of fact. When I saw 3rd Gen come out I was too happy. Saw them come on sale for black Friday and had to get 2. I gave the 2nd gen to my mother I put the 3rd gen in my bed room and the sound beautiful fills the room with sound. Worth the price I am a fan of Echo. I also have 3 Echo shows as well. Just to show I'm not just talking. Waiting for the Sub woofer.
5.0,"December 31, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I bought this on black Friday due to my Echo V. 1 broke . I do not recall seeing the stats on v.3 but what a surprise when I plugged it in. In addition to working flawlessly, the music quality is much better, especially with my Amazons UHD music subscription. Nice bass for such a small attractive Echo. I'm a lifelong audiophile and can now use my Echo 3 to play music for something other than background noise."
5.0,"December 29, 2019",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"This is my first Echo, before this, I only had Echo dot. The biggest difference is the ability to crank up the volume. The sound quality is great, and LOUD. It's shockingly loud for the small size! There is no downside at all, if you want an Echo for music, this is a GREAT buy in every way! I got it in red, and had to wait a few weeks for it, but I'm glad I did, and would absolutely buy it again."
5.0,"December 27, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,I bought three of these this Christmas... One for a granddaughter ten .. two for my twin daughters ... they are all having a ball asking this ALEXA all kinds of things.... It's a learning experience... I did mess up and put that one for g daughter app on my phone which when she took it home it didn't recognize her home... hopefully that will be resolved.... Amazon support gave me answers  immediately about that question... great gifts this year...
5.0,"December 13, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,Music sounds really good and Alexa's voice is loud and clear.  I only wish I had bought one of these sooner.  Am having so much fun with it.  The light blue speaker looks very nice sitting in the living room.  Shipping was fast and no damage.
3.0,"February 20, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I like the product. It is very helpful for things like checking the weather forecast, tracking amazon packages, playing music, etc. There are a few downsides, however. Every once in a while it mistakes a random phrase for the activation word and turns on. Usually it turns off soon after, but it has sometimes mistaken what I was saying to someone else as a question for it and begins to rattle off an answer. Then there are times where I ask it a question and it turns on but doesn’t answer. The blue light ring just stays on. When this happens, I always need to unplug the echo and plug it back in to solve the issue. A bit tedious as it happens about once a week. I’d say that this is a good product overall, but I don’t like how the issues seem to be popping up more often. The two problems I mentioned are the only ones I’ve noticed so far, but they are fairly big ones to me."
5.0,"January 4, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"Aside from all the things the Echo is able to do, we purchased this device for my daughter who is a high school dance major. She has to practice her choreography a lot and is constantly having to stop and go over to her phone to replay or rewind her music. Being able to speak to Alexa and have her pause or rewind a song however many seconds needed has been really helpful to my daughter. It allows her to focus more on her dance without losing momentum or focus. The sound quality is excellent. We have enjoyed using the Echo, as well, for all the other added conveniences a smart device brings to the home and I can see us purchasing a few more in the future."
4.0,"January 9, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I love my Alexa! It's not perfect by any means. The sync system is off no matter how many times I mess with it. For example, Alexa can turn on the TV no problem. However, it won't actually control the television (like changing channels or turning the TV back off). At the same time, it's AWESOME for listening to music. The sound is incredible! The music selection is vast, too. So, I give it a solid four."
4.0,"February 6, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Alexa Echo lives up to they hype. Alexa is more intuitive and easier to use than ""Hey Google"" on our phone. We especially like being able to ""drop in"" on the kids when they are home alone and they let their phones die. The sound quality is very good. The Echo connects with our Spotify account but is sometimes difficult getting it to play from a saved playlist; it will play individual songs just fine. The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that we just really don't use it that much. After the first couple weeks of ""new toy"" time we just don't see a need for it that much. Still a very cool product."
2.0,"January 25, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"This is honestly a 2 star experience for me until I there is an option in the app to delay the internal speaker audio. IMPORTANT: All models of amazon echos do not currently have any way to delay the aux output and each model has a different fixed latency at the aux out. If you are looking to use the Echo to drive a bigger system for multi room, you must buy the same Echo model and you must use the aux output at each endpoint. If you use aux at one endpoint and internal speaker at another there will be a perceivable delay between the two devices. There should be a way to manually delay the device with the internal speaker to align to the latent audio of the device with aux out, but there isn’t. I work as an engineer at a networked audio company and we do this all the time - it is professional industry standard. It is possible and it would make this product incredible."
4.0,"December 15, 2019",Sandstone,Echo,"Aun Alexa esta muy elemental en Informacion, le pides música por ejemplo y te envía a que compres app de Musica, la opción libre  por ejemplo de Marc Anthony solo te pone 1 y las demás ni son del mismo genero y nada que  ver con el artista. Por otro lado es simpática, cada vez que le dices Buenos Dias pues te da informacion, canta muy bien y los chicos se divierten en casa y aprenden algunas cosas. Esta en Español es una nueva mejor opción para muchos."
5.0,"January 7, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I am a first time Echo owner. It's been nice. It is a great speaker. It also has answers to random questions we have. The kids like asking Alexa for jokes, play games , etc. I like to use it to set timers, and listen to music. I'm sure there are a lot of other features that I don't know about yet. The only bad thing is that when my kindle is in the same room, it hears my voice better when I say ""Alexa"" and tries to respond. Over all, I'm glad I got it."
3.0,"January 21, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Alexa follows basic commands.....I have an issue with the device turning itself off and the only way I've found to fix it is to unplug it and the plug it back in. It does this at least once a day. I've called customer service which recommended plugging the device into it's own dedicated socket.....I had it plugged in on a surge protector bar. I haven't had any problems with it since then.....but that was just last night, so we'll see. I guess no technology is perfect. Whoops!....my music just stopped and the device is again not responding......not good."
4.0,"January 6, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"The new Echo seems to do everything as well as my Gen 1 unit, but the new speakers provide deeper bass. The one difference I didn’t see as an improvement was that changing the volume manually on the new unit is done by pressing a + or - button instead of turning the rotating ring used on the Gen 1. Using these buttons, especially in the dark, is a hit or miss proposition, especially since there are 4 of them, all the same size, so no way to distinguish by feel. The ring was not only more intuitive, but I always got the desired result. I know that volume can be adjusted by voice, but then you can’t hear the program material as Alexa changes the volume. This is a minor complaint, more of an observation. One thing I really like is being able to synchronize playback on both units. I will probably add a third unit to get music (or whatever) playing throughout the house."
4.0,"December 26, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I have to admit I resisted buying one since I wanted to make sure all the bugs were out before I took the plunge. It works fantastic. Truly. I haven't really taken it out for a real ""test ride"" as of yet. But I will very soon. Right now it's in our bathroom so we have music to listen to when we're in there. The only thing that would make this even better would to have it rechargable since the cord is unsightly."
5.0,"December 12, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I really love my echo I wish it was compatible with Apple Music.  I was thrilled to know I could make it portable with the portable battery base..yea, now I’m really in love with my echo. I think in the description you should advertise that you can go portable with a a separate purchase of the battery base.  I think that would Encourage more people to purchase the echo making a portable is so convenient."

Only negative is music quality is noticeably less than my Bose but... the convenience of voice control is worth it."
5.0,"December 28, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"It is super cool that you can speak both English and Spanish at the same time to Alexa. I honestly thought that was not possible. This is the feature that I appreciate the most, since it is very useful to me when I am asking Alexa to play Cumbias in Spotify. The sound quality is superb, I have linked my echo to My fire TV stick and now when I I'm watching a movie the sound quality improved tremendously, it did the job as a soundbar. So I could say that you can probably call it a ""smart soundbar"". When I got this gift it included a Smart switch from Kasa and it makes it very easy to turn on and off my room lamp through echo. Overall I can say that I am pretty satisfied with the quality of the sound and the easiness of which Alexa understands both languages."

However, it was super simple to set up and navigate, and Alexa helps by offering suggestions of what you can do or say. I ordered an Alexa compatible smart plug about a month later (which was also super simple and easy to set up), and I absolutely love the fact that I can ask Alexa to turn on or off my living room light, including all the other functions that she does. I sometimes feel lazy now that I have her to do so many things (such as setting a timer or alarm, updating me on the current weather, playing my music, turning up or down the volume, answering my questions, etc) but I've definitely gotten used to my Echo and appreciate how much it's able to do!"

3.0,"January 22, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"We use it primarily for controlling lighting, grocery lists, egg timer/alarm, and reminders and works well for those tasks. It typically has trouble understanding what we want if we ask for something else. Music, in particular, is difficult to play. We should be able to play music from our smartphones or from prime music but it doesn't usually work. When we ask for weather, it mentions a neighboring local city, not the name of our suburb, even though it has our address/location with zip code.  I suppose it's a learning process to get it connected with devices and get it to understand us. Sometimes it makes suggestions, like ask ""this"" but when we do, it responds that it doesn't understand what we want. Frustrating."
5.0,"January 29, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"We like this new version of the Echo. Our #1 Echo got knocked over by the cats a few too many times (and the final time by me) and eventually stopped working.

5.0,"January 16, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,"Just love my Amazon Alexa. I really love the feature on being able to request and hear songs I love. Also like that I can send my wife a message from my Smart phone to our Alexa. The sound of the music is just like having a big stereo system. So very handy to as Alexa for the weather in Bisbee, or in another country. Alexa can be a lot of company if someone is alone, and wants to hear the news or something. I can also have Alexa  call my cell phone for my wife. My wife had a stroke and bought this item to give her some company and help. I am a very happy customer on my buy."
5.0,"February 8, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Nice little sound system as oppose to using the large home stereo, easy to set up via smart phone. For its size it produces full sound quite well, a little bass heavy and could use a little more top end,  but all in all I'm quite happy with the Echo device. Apparently it does quite a bit, however I bought it for music play back while I read and works excellent for all intended purposes."
5.0,"December 24, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I got this mainly to listen to music, especially Christmas music.  I have enjoyed having it so much.  I listen to music all the time and have made specific playlists.  I've asked Alexa questions and have a good time listening to the answers she comes up with.  I like it so much that I bought a second one for the master bedroom.  I love the Twilight Blue color I bought for the bedroom."
5.0,"December 21, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"It's my first smart speaker and I like it so far. I'm positive that it can do much more than I'm currently asking of it. At minimum, I wanted a clock radio, but this gives me so much more. Since I got it on sale, it wasn't too much more expensive than a clock radio and the sound quality and its capabilities far exceed what a clock radio can offer.  It took a little effort to set it up, but everything works great now."
5.0,"December 25, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,I recently purchased an Echo Dot for my son and was pleased with the sound for such a small device. I then decided to by this full sized Echo for my wife. The sound is very good. The bass is surprisingly good and the mids and highs are excellent. I can't imagine getting better sound for the money ($59.99 on sale). The voice recognition works well in English. I haven't tried it in Spanish yet.
5.0,"February 17, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"After having been introduced to the Echo Dot, I thought I would go for its larger brother, the Echo, for its better sound.  Using a Gift Card, I purchased it from Target about two weeks ago.  I learned, however, I needed to install a special Amazon app on my cell phone to initiate and complete the process.  The installation was fairly straight-forward. Soon afterward, our son give us a smart plug to turn on/off the living room light.  How handy!  I am sure the other possibilities are virtually endless. Glad to be brought into the 21st century with these smart devices!  Recommended."
1.0,"January 5, 2020",Heather Gray,with $10 Smart Plug,"In general they are great, my refurbished first gen served us without issue for years and has been passed on to family. This new one doesn't listen, fails to execute/acknowledge commands and randomly crackles like it has bad wiring. Currently awaiting customer service to rectify with more than poorly written responses telling me of tech support and that the item is out of stock for replacement (spoiler alert, it is not out of stock)"
5.0,"January 2, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I am almost totally satisfied with this device. I use it daily and frequently to help me get through the day. I have recently had to put my wife in a memory care facility, because she has dementia. I had hoped she could use the device, but it’s too complicated for her in her condition. She has no short-term memory at this time, and still can’t remember how to operate the device. Also, the change in volume level as music is played, frustrates her. At one moment it is too soft, at the next it is too loud. Too bad it doesn’t have AVC, Automatic volume control such as we have on radios."
5.0,"October 28, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Me gustó puedo mover todos los dispositivos , cualquier pregunta se puede jugar muchas cosas más,  y no me gusto que no escucha bien con el volumen alto , no es recargable  en caso  de se valla usa sólo con Bluetooth."
3.0,"January 21, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"I love this,  but it has a flaw... it recognizes kids voices.  This means I've heard baby shark more often than anyone should have to endure.  The sound quality is great.  Baby shark can be turned up and heard throughout the house. It does seem to have a glitch.  I need to unplug it and reset it about once a week.  I keep hoping it will stop doing that but it hasn't after a few weeks of ownership.  I would have said it was more stars if it wasn't for that."
5.0,"January 5, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"What I dislike like and maybe someone can answer this - I can call out on Alexa to my contacts and talk to them however, I can not answer in coming calls from my contacts on Alexa.  She states ""no incoming call"" even though my phone is ringing.  I do like having the ability to listen to music, weather etc. without pulling out my phone or having the TV on.  I would recommend this product highly."
4.0,"January 2, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,It's clear that the product has evolved since the original echo I purchased way way way way back when. However I I do feel like the speakers are not quite the same quality individually that they used to be. I have seen stereo pairs with the subwoofers sound amazing at what really is a good price for a 2.1 home audio system but I had higher expectations of the individual unit.
3.0,"January 14, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"My Echo dot units seem to do a better job of understanding what I'm saying. For some reason the Echo gets confused. I've tried moving it's location and to speak more clearly, she just has issues...not sure why :("
3.0,"January 5, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Love the spontaneous ability to call up music on a whim. I’m not extremely tech savvy so I did have to call in and have help setting it up. That was easy and Amazon gets a 6 star for their help. The unit seems to get lost and forgets what is supposed to be doing. Things like playing more than one song by the artist. We mainly purchased this to play music throughout our home and was unaware there was a limit to “how many” echos connected together. As we purchased a package of 3 echos and a sub. The limit is said to be three, leaving us with a “rouge” echo. Still nice and for the money the sound is great for us. All in all it’s a good product we may just need to know better."
5.0,"January 26, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"This is my second Alexa. My first was a refurbished older one to see if it was really all that. Just like my many Kindle’s and Fire’s, I don’t know how I ever got along without them. Alexa does everything. She finds the best NPR stations for me not to mention playing my favorite music and reminding me of appointments and so many other things I have yet to learn."
5.0,"December 20, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I didn't expect this kind of sound coming out of an echo device! I'm seriously impressed!  The sound is crisp and rich and even has some decent bass with out a subwoofer!  And since I bought it on Black Friday, it was delivered to my door at a fabulous price! It basically set itself up so quickly I was almost disappointed that I didn't have to do more!  I highly recommend this product!"
5.0,"February 14, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"We are really enjoying our Alexa.  Mostly we use it to listen to Amazon Unlimited Music, but it is so convenient to get information quickly, such as what time does the Super Bowl start, what is the weather forecast for the day, who won the Heisman  Trophy this year, etc.  My hubby really didn't want to purchase an Echo originally, but he enjoys it now more than ever."
3.0,"January 16, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Alexa turns her self on without me talking to her. Several times I have come into the house to find Alexa on with some radio station. I often leave the radio on as I am in & out so assumed she heard something on the radio, not my voice. About 4AM this morning I woke up & Alexa was talking away! There was no radio or TV on & I sleep in another room with the door closed. I asked Alexa who turned her on, she said she could not answer that question. It is kind of a fun toy, not sure she is worth the money."
1.0,"January 9, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"When it works the sound is great. However, it doesn’t work very often. Sometimes it’ll play when I want to play and then it’ll just stop. Or sometimes the subwoofer will play but then the echo won’t. We have no clue why it does this because customer support won’t call us back. Even though they said they would. So, we are going to return it because this sucks."
5.0,"December 29, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,Hands down voice recognition on the Echo 3rd Gen is way better than Bose 500. I purchased a Bose 500 with Alexa because that wife wanted better audio than the Echo Dot...so I went all in and well we were very disappointed in the Bose voice recognition. But this Echo is spot on and yes the sound quality isn't studio quality but it satisfies the wife.
5.0,"January 9, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,What a change from my Echo (1st Gen). The sound is amazing out of this small form factor device. I actually enjoy listening to music on it. I especially love that you can change the 3.5mm jack to either Input or Output. That is a very useful feature. I connected an old streaming device to the new echo and I can listen to my music library through the new Echo speaker. This is a definite upgrade from my original 1st Gen echo.I may start upgrading all my original Echos.
1.0,"February 19, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"DON'T BUY THESE FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN SINGLE ECHO Super disappointed in these. Not only is Alexa nowhere close to being AI as she cant do nearly any simple thing you ask her. NOTE: When these are paired into a Stereo Configuration (as they advertise you can do) you lose the two of the main features of these devices; 1. If paired  into Stereo you can not stream to it via your mobile phone bluetooth 2. If Paired and using the One In you can only play one the device you are physically plugged into, again losing Stereo Pairing and losing your Echo Sub if you have one, which we do. Super bummed because the return window has closed so I'm stuck with these rather dumb devices."
5.0,"January 29, 2020",Sandstone,with $10 Smart Plug,"I got this as a Christmas gift for my son-in-law. He is extremely happy with it and uses it mostly to listen to music and to control his smart appliances.  The sound quality of this echo is incredible and is able to be turned very loud but without any distortion. He has had no trouble having it recognize his voice, not so easy for me with a Scottish accent!"
5.0,"January 17, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"El sonido de este parlante es realmente sorprendente. Lo compré en un Best Buy en Orlando Florida y tuve la oportunidad de comparar su sonido con un Bose Soundlink Revolve y el Echo lo deja por el piso. Este Echo tiene un sonido realmente bueno. Una de sus características es que tiene un procesador y bocinas premium con tecnología Dolby que reproducen sonido de 360° impecable. En definitiva, este es parlante que estaba buscando y lo recomiendo muchísimo. Ojalá algún día salga un Echo con batería para llevarlo sin cables a cualquier parte.... es lo único que le falta para ser perfecto"
3.0,"January 8, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"Somewhat disappointed.  The voice recognition isn’t as good as my original Echo.  I know, I know:  lots of people said that in the reviews, but...sigh.  Consequently, I kept my original Echo, along with this one. Update: the thing is a complete pain!  Not only is the microphone awful, it has now stopped responding when I attempt to use the volume buttons.  What the hell, Amazon?!  Not sure if I can still return both this and the battery I purchased, but I’m going to look into it."
5.0,"January 14, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"We've been blown away at how Fabulous the sound is. Bose can't be better or much better! We've been asking for songs we want to hear and then along those lines, Alexa's additional suggestions are great! And yeah, setting up our song playlists; as well as our shopping lists is really nice.  And shut the Front door.... us older folks only had to plug it in and set up was almost instant!!!"
5.0,"January 4, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I received Alexa as a Christmas gift from my children. I like the idea that I can ask Alexa to play a song that I like without having to use a radio and listen to ads and all kinds of interruptions. This is a wonderful gift that I really love. There are so many things I can ask Alexa, i.e., what is the weather, what time is it, etc. It was easy to set up."
1.0,"December 30, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Don't wish to review, I did the trade in for my echo and it was in perfect condition at time of return however once Amazon received it it was rated non-working and in poor cosmedic condition. This negated the 30$ turn in valuse which subsequently overdrew my account. I called and after a bit they refunded my 30$ but did not and would not cover the overdrawn fee of 25$ the support person said she escalated my issue up a level and I have yet to hear back. Now this 25$ overdraft fee has grown to 50$ very unhappy to say the lease"
5.0,"December 17, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I knew the capabilities of this device before I bought it and of course, that’s why I wanted it. However, I didn’t realize just how much I’d love it! I’m a stay at home mom, so I spend most of my time going from room to room cleaning, folding laundry, etc. I got 2 devices. An Echo for the bedroom, and a Show for the dining room. I like to play music on them. It’s like having in-home surround sound but without the expensive installation! I’ll definitely be getting more echoes to place around my home to amplify the experience."
1.0,"January 31, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"Have had this for about a month and was able to connect it to my Alexa easily and it worked fine for a while, but recently it’s been having some trouble knowing when to sync with Alexa (for music) and when not to. A lot of static and cutting off happening. Planning on giving it a little more time before I contact Amazon for a replacement. Never had any issues with my Alexa, so disappointed."
5.0,"December 25, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,I got this to play music while doing household work and cooking.  I love the timer and I love most of the little weather things I get.  I do not have a smart house so it is limited use.  But I do love the sound quality.  I also enjoy that if I do not want anything to be heard I can hit a mute button (not that I have anything to hide).  But love the option.
5.0,"February 13, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"Generally, for relatively minor functional (feature) changes I don't usually move to upgrade. After all, the 2nd Edition was great! However, if you use your Echo a lot and look for the sound to be consistent across the frequency spectrum and at all volume levels (for its class, of course), then you will find this update worth the move. The high-ends are not tinny, and the bass is sufficiently booming without over blowing the mid range. And it is a little more responsive to voice command - but not so much as to be obvious to casual users. Nice update for the sound quality. (However, when there is a 4th Edition I'll be expecting major feature changes... just saying :-) )"
5.0,"January 14, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"My daughter bought this for me for Christmas and I was unsure if I wanted it.  The Echo has been so much fun!  I enjoy asking for my favorite music to be played, adding items to grocery list- which is hooked up to my iPhone to use at grocery store.  It also can tell me the temperature or weather, tell a joke, or play a game.  How did I live without it?"
1.0,"January 8, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"This is the future? Then I want NONE OF IT. I am a self proclaimed computer/gadget nerd and was waiting for the 3rd generation.  Call this one the POS Generation. This unit continues to ignore my commands. It hears me, blue, yellow then dark. If I wanted to be ignored, I would have stayed married. I have reset reset reset, deleted app, downloaded app, reset reset reset. This thing is about as stupid as my ex. Nice job Amazon. You make me want to go back to Apple which I swore I never would."
5.0,"December 30, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,Uuufff hey do not hesitate to buy the alexa the best of the best sound quality is the same as the JBL and of the most expensive I already have the 2nd generation and this the 3rd speaks for itself only alexa the best. or and I have in my room the best sound in volvente also very easy to connect just follow the application of alexa and already super easy connection.
5.0,"January 13, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I just completed setup of 3rd generation paired speakers.  I also purchased adjustable speaker stands to have them at ear level (while sitting down).  For the price of these speakers, can't beat it.  Loving the stereo sound after having a single echo plus in the den.  Your going to spend a lot more to get better sound.  Good deal... happy customer!"
4.0,"December 23, 2019",Sandstone,Echo,"Most everything is good, easy to use and doesn’t take up much space.  Set up was also easy.  The problem I have been having is a couple of times so far there is static in the speaker and it pops and goes out.  I couldn’t get it to turn off after multiple requests........and then it finally turned off.  The other one I have in the basement has had no problems."

You’re welcome."
4.0,"February 8, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,"I love the sound on the newer echo, vs the original one.  I've moved the older one into another room and the sound on that beats the sound on the echo dot, so it's a win.  The only problem I've had with it is that it doesn't respond as quickly as my other echo devices.  Sometimes, I have to say the ""wake"" name a couple of times before it wakes up."
5.0,"December 4, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Love the improvements made on the GEN 3s sound quality, makes our gen 2s sound lacking. Went with the Blue color and very happy. Using 6 echos and 4 dots to provide full house coverage, and they work very well together. The app can glitch a little with the various listening groups, but with a little patience everything is starting to work exactly as it should."
5.0,"January 4, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I mostly use this product for listening to music. It's worked for me thus far and adding songs to my playlist is convenient. I'm just a little concerned about the ""always on"" microphone. Seems like it could easily be used as a wiretap, and judging from some articles, that is a major concern for this product. I'm definitely uneasy about it keeping a record of anything I say, and while the policy claims it's not spying on customers, it's difficult to know if that's legitimately true or just a claim to avoid potential lawsuits."
5.0,"January 3, 2020",Charcoal,Echo," I loved the first one so much I bought another for my bedroom. I had an Echo dot, but the sound quality isn’t great for playing music. This sound quality rivals my Bose Bluetooth speaker, and turns on easily at my command. I am playing music so much more than I ever did because it’s so easy. Love it."
5.0,"January 23, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I thought being pre-digital that I would not like this type of device. I wanted to see what all the fuss was about so ordered one. Completely blew my mind with the sound quality. And Alexa knows everything. I asked her the address of my elementry school (thatis no longer), and darn if she didn't give me the address when the schoo closed and what is there now. Wish Alexa I could have taken Alexa to school!"
5.0,"December 22, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"the quality of this product is very durable. i love the sound quality, and the voice recognition is out of this world! i could be 10 feet away from it and it would probably still pick up my voice. i didn’t like how whenever i asked to play a song it would shuffle play the radio (of that specific song) but that was solved by a connection to spotify (although when i ask to play a playlist, it plays a different playlist made by spotify, for example, even if i said the name exactly). anyways, overall, this is an amazing product! i love how theres games, weather, and even sleep sounds built in to the echo. the only setback is that this needs to be plugged in (if you unplug it, it’ll automatically turn off :c) in order for it to work. i’m extremely satisfied with this version of the amazon echo :))"
3.0,"December 17, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,"Since I had an Echo in the Family Room, I decided to buy 2 Echo Dots for the Master Bedroom and the Computer Room to act as intercoms.  I keep the sound at a reasonably level for music, questions, and timers/reminders/alarms, but it is too hard to hear the other room when I DROP IN.  There needs to be a skill that can do multiple steps so I can increase the sound at each end, listen/talk, then set the sound back to the original level when I'm done using  as an intercom."
4.0,"January 9, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I just upgraded from an Echo Dot to the latest Echo device, and overall I am quite pleased.  The sound quality is amazingly better for playing music from multiple sources, and interaction with Alexa is also very good.  The only quibble I have is that the new Echo does not seem to recognize my voice commands as easily as the Echo Dot when I am farther away from it; and there are a few commands that, somehow, the Echo does not understand (although the Echo Dot certainly did, and does).  Nonetheless, I am still very pleased I made the upgrade."
4.0,"January 7, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I got Alexa for radio, pod casts, and the occasional song. Audio is clear and loud with a smaller foot print than the radio/computer. Simply tell Alexa the station ID, and it will change stations.   Before I bought this device, I verified it would work with Windows 7, since it must be connected to a wireless modem using your home computer. (I do not have an i-phone.) When I tried to download the Alexa application software, the download would not finish due to my inadequate web security software. I had to purchase web security software and the help desk cleaned my disk of files I didn't even know I had. My machine runs much faster and Alexa works great. The help desk was very helpful and answered any question/concern I had.   Maybe if I had Apple based computer at home or an i-phone this wouldn't have been a problem??"
5.0,"January 4, 2020",Sandstone,with $10 Smart Plug,"We upgraded are original echo with this after reading about the upgraded sound. The sound is amazing with full bass and mids. Many small speakers fall flat when in these two areas. Besides the sound, the small shape and color options are added bonuses. My family commented how much prettier it is compared to the original. Aesthetically  speaking, it is one of the best looking speakers on the market. Regarding voice recognition, Alexa easily understands all members of my family, even my youngest, who has delays in articulation. Overall it’s a well made, sturdy, compact, and useful product."
4.0,"February 15, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"We love Alexa in our house! This new Echo has been the perfect addition to our devices. The speaker is loud enough to fill our open living/dining/kitchen space easily. It is also a great quality sound. A great improvement from prior generations.  I love how the devices can sync up with each other to play music and other things throughout the house. I also am quite fond of the intercom feature. Some of our kids are downstairs so now I don't have to yell down the stairs to get their attention! The only shortcoming is Alexa not always have the answers we may be looking for. She gets better and better every day, though. Not much of a complaint. The look is very sleek and fits easily in any space with the different color options."
3.0,"January 3, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"The echo is pretty nice. I bought this primarily for music I dont too much care about the other bells and whistles. The sound quality is great. Bass is pretty good to for a single speaker. I like to voice functions although it doesnt understand something at least a few times a day. I'm super disappointed in the paid Amazon music app though. Not at all intuitive, user friendly, or fun to operate. I'm considering returning the echo for a google home. Google has an excellent music app. Most of my family has the echo so I'm trying to stick with it but.. idk. I'm annoyed daily by that damn music app."
2.0,"January 24, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Line-in audio turns off on its own when watching TV/Movies. When audio becomes too quiet, the Echo turns off the line-in and will not return unless there is a large boost in audio, or on the app it is switched to line-out and then back to line-in. **Confirmed with support staff: ""the line-in was NOT intended to support constant audio-in. When the Echo Studio CAN and DOES support constant audio-in. The Echo 3rd Gen line-in was meant for playing MP3 devices that don’t have Bluetooth on the Echo.""** This seems to be a software based issue that could be fixed, but so far it has not been and is supposedly going to be happening to Echo Studio as well. PS. Sound quality is great"
2.0,"December 27, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"We love our echo when it is working properly. The sound is very good. However,  the echo turns off randomly and doesn't respond to commands.  We listen to a lot of audiobooks.  When asking for audiobooks it has a hard time playing books that are in my library.  For example I'll say ""Alexa play magic tree house books 9-16"" it does not recognize the book in audible. But instead play a previous book of the same time that it has played numerous times.  It's very frustrating. I have had to unplug it many times because it skips and does not recognize anything. And I've only had it for maybe 2 months."
5.0,"December 25, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Setup was far easier than the Gen 1 Echo or the Gen 2 Echo Dots.  It immediately detected our home Wireless network, logged in because the password was already registered with our current Echo setup, and only required some minor customization (change the name and location in the Alexa App).  Speaker sounds better than the Gen 1 Echo too."
3.0,"January 5, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I don’t like that Alexa plays the wrong thing after she repeats exactly what i ask of her. It’s really weird. I also don’t like that we have to pay an extra monthly fee to listen specific music from amazon music when you pay all this money for the product you still have to pay extra to enjoy it. Also she was programmed to my voice yet still she listens to everyone who calls her name.
1.0,"November 30, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Very upset. I bought new echo 3rd gen. However, it's an inferior quality product. No sound no light on. Ask customer service to replace a new one. Do they test this device before leaving factory?"
5.0,"January 24, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I love my Alexa device, I use her for music, my alarm, weather and entertainment.

5.0,"December 16, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"We needed something in our livingroom with a bit better sound quality than our existing Echo Dot. This certainly filled the requirement nicely.

5.0,"February 7, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,I purchased it because it worked with jw.org and it seems to work well. I have been surprised how handy it is to have when I’m curious about the weather or wanting to listen to a channel on SiriusXM. It’s jokes are a little corny but it usually makes me laugh. The notification feature when Amazon delivers a package is also quite convenient
5.0,"January 13, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"The only downside to this product is I didn't buy it sooner. The sound quality is great for music and the voice recognition is spot on. I listen to music constantly and usually at a loud volume when I am home alone, Alexa still picks up my voice even speaking at a normal level. I have a pretty strong southern accent and it has no problem deciphering what I am trying to say. I would recommend this product to everyone."
5.0,"December 27, 2019",Sandstone,Echo,This device is EVERYTHING I was hoping for and more. It looks great. Sounds awesome! I have the original Echo Dot. I think most would agree you can’t use that for any serious music playing. I then purchased an Echo Input so that I could hook it up to any serious speaker system. But I wanted something all inclusive. This fits the bill. I’m completely happy with this purchase and I have been telling my family and friends to get one too!
5.0,"February 3, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,Sound quality us good given the size of the unit. Voice recognition is pretty consistent. The utility is great. For ne the ability to create and populate lusts hands free as needed items occur to me is priceless.

2.0,"December 29, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,We have a echo dot and I thought this upgrade would be a great Christmas.  I expected the sound to be much better than it is.  From the beginning we have had problems setting it up and it stops playing music a couple times a day.  The ECHO DOT keeps playing on the same internet connection and the ECHO 3rd gen stops.  It may be going back.
5.0,"December 18, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I wanted a second Echo for a bedroom to be able to play Amazon unlimited music.  I have to say the sound quality on this one is much better than my original Echo.  Much deeper, richer sound.  Got this as a Black Friday deal, so even better.  Love that it was fairly easy to move my smart plugs to it without much of an issue.  Happy with it."
5.0,"January 12, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"The Echo hears & understands like a human! Seriously, it’s blazing quick to respond and puts out great sound. One caveat: my residence is entirely wireless. While I can put several Echo devices online at once, all on the same network, they will not sync, I.e., play stereo using two devices. My network uses link isolation for WiFi security. Bluetooth will only work for a few minutes before it loses connection. I’m looking for a workaround in the form of computer to router to access point—Mac OS, arrrgh, won’t set up wireless internet sharing from a wireless network. Amazon’s support for these devices is an absolute waste of time, lots of time."
5.0,"February 4, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"She malfunctions when I'm using the microwave, but, otherwise, is great. I've rapidly grown accustomed to having Alexa. Routines are magical. I say, ""alexa, good morning"" and she gives me a fun fact, tells me the weather, and anything on my agenda for the day. I ask questions, play music, get recipes, keep lists... Alexa is wonderful. My 4 year old child and my 60 year old bff also love her. So, she's not age dependent."
5.0,"January 7, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"My wife and kids have seen this at friends and family's homes recently, and were very excited to invite Alexa into the house.  We also have 2 ""dots"" for the kids rooms, and Alexa is great a playing them bedtime music.  She is currently taking a break from controlling lights, as the X-mas decorations have come down.  However setting that up after everything was opened was quite simple. -Shawn"
5.0,"December 23, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,"I purchased the Echo to go with 3 of the echo dots I purchased earlier this year,  I am still learning all of the things that Alexa can do.  The sound from the Echo is very clear, when playing music I can't tell any doffernce from when we have our stereo on.  The design of the Eho is very nice and looks great on my kitchen island,"
5.0,"November 25, 2019",Sandstone,Echo,I love it to easily play music I enjoy and change the volume.  It was a gift intended to help me keep track of medications for a short time period.  It worked beautifully for that.  I like it so much I ordered the Dot for another room. Think I need another Dot now.
5.0,"January 21, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,I love the speaker and the sound is excellent. My only problem is when I purchased prime music I put it on my Echo Dot and Now that i’ve purchased the GEN three speaker prime music will not work with my GEN three. Unless I give the command to Echo Dot.  So I have to go through Echo Dot in order to play prime music on both devices . Alexa said I had to purchase prime music again for the new speaker. But if I go through Echo Dot  then it works on both speakers. But I love it it’s great Music!  I’m having a blast with it.
5.0,"January 10, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,My daughter got me Alexa for Christmas and I love it. I listen to music while I'm working and the quality of the sound is great. I'm always making a list for one thing or another and Alexa is great for helping me keep track of everything. I like how all I have to do is tell her to add something to a particular list and she does it.When I am ready to write down the list I just for it and she will tell me everything on it. Best Christmas present ever
5.0,"February 13, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I mostly use this device for music. It’s quality of sound is better than most stereos I’ve had over the years which amazed me at first. Now I’m just spoiled by it. I do have other echo devices. I have them linked through my amazon app, I use them to play music throughout my home - I am not super tech savvy - but I was able to follow the easy instructions in my Alexa app to link them together to play music together. I also have several smart plugs and I use them via the Alexa to turn off and on lights in the house - and all I have to say is “Alexa turn on the bedroom lamp” - I can’t say enough about echos. This one in particular is definitely worth it."
5.0,"February 22, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I like the convenience of listening to ANY music on voice command!! That was my main reason for purchasing Alexa Echo 7. I like the alarm for waking up with your favorite song or radio station for the news. The connection with your phone is great because you can call any of your contacts hands free. I really am glad that I purchased this awesome device! Thank you for making it easy to text or call you when ever I have a question and being able to do so 24/7!!
5.0,"January 28, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"My daughters bought me an Alexa for a Christmas present. I did not want one. Now I absolutely love it!  I can turn my lights on and off and listen to whatever music I'm in the mood for. I know there is so much I can do but haven't had the time lately to check everything out. But I do love my Alexa, it was the perfect gift!"
3.0,"January 23, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I was disappointed by the sound . I have the 2nd generation and it actually sounds better than this one . This one has less bass , less treble and is not as loud . ( even after tweaking the equalizer ) If you are looking to replace your last gen ... don’t . If you are purchasing this as your first : it’s ok . Disappointed."
5.0,"January 1, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,From the first generation echo I had. They have certainly Improved on the echo. I do miss being able to turn the top to adjust the volume. But overall sound quality and voice recognition have improved a lot for me. I like the fact that I can have an external aux cable as well if I need it. Overall I’ve been pleased with it.
5.0,"December 11, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,very hard to get it up and working.access to get the app.you had to go thru Microsoft to get to it and that was a problem I still don't have the app. other people I know who have this also said it was really bad getting it programed other wise it seems good so far.just don't know how we got it working but will try to get app. again later. need a tech. support contact to get thru this problem.
5.0,"January 10, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"There is nothing I dislike.  I love how I can tell it to change the tempature in the house, play music, turn lights and fireplace off and on.  Asking questions is the best and savings appointments in my calendar. I even use it to make up my grocery list so I don't have to type it.  So many other things but too many to name."
5.0,"January 5, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Works very well. It is not very often it does not understand me. Overall it is a great unit. I have one in each of my bedrooms. The expensive part is getting all the sensors that That you needed to operate Alexa. Each light fan and whatever needs its own receiver. If you can do the electrical part you can save a lot of money by not having to hire it out.
1.0,"December 29, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,What this item for my fiance for Christmas received the first one and would not connect to Wi-Fi set on the phone for 45 minutes with a customer service rep still couldn't get it to work got them to send me another one had the same issue with the new one this time customer service was out of India could barely understand that customer service rep and she was very rude I will be returning the second one I'm done with these
5.0,"December 15, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,I really like this speaker.  Sounds great for being so small. I have 3 second generation and 1 3rd gen. To be honest I can’t tell the difference between the two. I think they both sound good.  Great to hook up for multi room group. Work on cleaning the whole house and have them playing in all the rooms at the same time.
5.0,"January 17, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I received as a Christmas gift and was a little leery I must admit.  So far so good as the set up is super easy.  I am getting more comfortable with it and so far so good.  The sound when playing music is awesome.  Occasionally, I get a bit nervous about it's capability, but I'm sure I'll get used to it and use it more."
4.0,"February 19, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Love the new unit , as always it’s not that easy to connect all speakers at the same time. They will all play at the same time but I must repeat the command too many time and sometimes I give up in frustration. I own 5 Alexas and would consider other other products but not so sure of the investment is worth it. Would like to try them before I had to pay for them."
3.0,"December 23, 2019",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"The product is tons better than the original dot.. they shouldn’t really be compared. But the bass is seriously lacking.. I have a similar speaker in size of this one, and the bass response is much better on that one. Outside of this for lower volume listening like at a desk, or while cooking, this is wounderful! On a side note, I tried to measure the response, it seems that anything below a certain Hz is cut. So the low bass is almost muted."
5.0,"December 5, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"One of the most fun smart speakers I've owned. This is my first alexa device and boy was I blown by the level at which alexa has reached. With all the smart skills and the 'even better' stupid skills, I have become a fan. Whispering is one cool feature, I just talk to it in whispers now. One thing that I would love to see in the future is able to set a custom word to wake alexa up. I would also want a 'beast mode' or savage mode that would make alexa super sassy like if I ask it who is better, google home or echo it should say 'you think you can get someone better than me? ANSWER IS A BIG NO' and stuff like that. I also wish that I could use stereo mode through bluetooth with ANY speaker rather than just with the same type of speaker, but what I have here is GOLD! love it !"
5.0,"January 30, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I love that I can tell Alexa to add something to my shopping list, ask her the temperature outside or the forecast for any city, put something on calendar and remind me about it, set a timer, talk Pikachu to my granddaughter, play music for her (or me), tell me when someone is at the front door, etc.  Very cool and so handy to have."
4.0,"February 12, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"This one doesn't make that sound when you say ALEXA, So is it supposed to?  My other one does, but I have the top of the line one.  I don't know if there is a difference in a newer version or not, so I just don't know if ALEXA hears me cuz I am waiting for that prompt sound after I say ALEXA, but it never happens."
4.0,"January 19, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Adquiri tres alexas, una para el auto el cual complicó el reconocimiento de app Spotify, en la echo show 8 el cual fue un obsequio para un adulto mayor, no le entendía al hablar o debía casi gritar para ser escuchado, me parece deberían permitir subir la recepción de sonido de los micrófonos, así como crear skills ajustadas a este segmento, en la mía echo he extrañado que le he efectuado varias consultas que fácilmente tienen respuestas en Google pero simplemente responde que desconoce la respuesta, me parece en esa parte si me ha decepcionado, pero como usuario nuevo sigo experimentando y espero prontas actualizaciones del software que mejore y amplíe las prestaciones actuales para nuestra satisfacción y lealtad a la marca."
5.0,"February 14, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"I have had each generation of the Echo, and it gets better with each evolution.  The sound quality over the 2nd Gen is clearly noticeable (better bass and overall quality).  Alexa reads to me every night from my Audible library.  I highly recommend this unit.  My only hope is the next gen has a clock face on it."
4.0,"December 25, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"We got this to add more sound to our house (we have echos in most of our rooms now, but most of them are dots, and we wanted some richer sound in the livingroom.  This is certainly better than the dot, but our echo show in the kitchen has better sound, and I was a bit surprised by that.  Still like this though."
2.0,"February 13, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,It constantly has to be unplugged and plugged back in to get it to work.  It can be working fine and all at once just stop for no reason.  I have to unplug and the plug back in to get it to start back up.  It also will on occasion start playing the information garbled -- again the only solution is the unplug/plug back in solution.
5.0,"January 20, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Finally this generation unit supports audio in on the Auxiliary port. it solved two problems, an Alexa device and a much needed decent speaker for a Monitor I have hooked up to an Apple TV!  Sound quality beats 2nd gen hands down, so much so I am considering a second unit to sync it to for stereo sound in my office."
3.0,"December 15, 2019",Sandstone,Echo,"I updated from my echo fist generation to this one. To be honest I trade in my Ins one and now with this one I’m totally regret the change , not significantly changes besides the look."
2.0,"December 20, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,First day after delivery we found out that it stops playing after 20 minutes or less and at times it stops in the middle of a song.  Tried customer support service and it was a nightmare to get them to understand the problem and rectify it.  After several phone calls and emails they agreed to send us a new unit...we are waiting.  Returning the defective unit was another saga I do not wish to pile on
5.0,"January 15, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"So I had a little echo dot and I loved it, but it was kind of quiet and the sound quality wasn't very good if I wanted to play music.  So I found my new Echo gen 3 for $25 off and thought I'd try it.  OMG, I love it.  The sound quality is amazing and it's so much more responsive to commands.  You should upgrade now."
5.0,"December 18, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Sound quality is 10x better than echo dot, and voice recognition has improved a lot since the 1st gen. While playing music at max volume, this 3rd Gen Echo will hear me say “Alexa” without making me yell (which is a problem I have with my 1st Gen Echo). If you rely on Alexa to wake you up, I can guarantee you won’t sleep through the alarm on this Echo!"
5.0,"December 2, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Gave it to my father in a senior apartment, placed it in a open faced tv stand. Sounds like an old schooled HK receiver. A+"
5.0,"January 13, 2020",Charcoal,with $10 Smart Plug,"I like the sound that comes from this tiny speaker. I have three Gen 2 and one Gen 3. I have them grouped together so there all playing throughout the house while cleaning. I play classic rock/80's/ & hair metal. they sound good for being so small. I have a lot of alexa devices, so these are awesome for me."
3.0,"December 13, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I have all types of Amazon Echo products, including dots and subwoofers that have better response then this item. I'm talking about voice command pick up. Overall sound quality is decent but was not really thrilled with the lack of response."
5.0,"February 8, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,"The sound quality is nowhere near as good as a Bose, but it’s really good for the price! The bass is a little lacking in carrying power (can’t really fill a room very well) but it has impressive close range depth and warmth. I’ve only had the arch 3rd gen for a few weeks and haven’t had much time to pair other devices/services with it, but what I have done so far has been easy and seamless. All in all a great product for a relatively reasonable price."
5.0,"January 25, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,This was basically a plug and play set-up since I purchased it connected to my Amazon account. It even connected itself to my wi-fi since I had already downloaded the Alexa app to my phone. It is very easy to use and the voice control is very responsive even when playing music quite loud. I am very satisfied with my purchase and plan to add other speakers in the future
4.0,"December 15, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,So far it is great ... we had an old black thin one and this one has so much better sound and better interaction which must be because it can hear better.  Just need to figure out all we can do with it now.
5.0,"December 3, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,I decided to upgrade to a newer version. I had two gen 1 echos which were still working well. I thought I would trade them in since these were on sale. They came a day earlier than expected and were very easy to set up. I like them as well as I liked the gen 1. They hopefully will last as long and as well.
5.0,"December 27, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,"these are way better sounding with more volume than the echo dots! that was an important feature because we like music on our roofed screen  porch which has some outside noise, one being the air conditioner compressor. also nice to sync our front Ring doorbell to and when doing so there is no need to buy a Ring chime !"
4.0,"February 1, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"While the Echo product works well, with great sound, as it is playing music it will occasionally shut off, go dead and I have to unplug and restart the process. I tried on three occasions talking to to Alexa after she stopped but nothing, no lights etc. Unplug and restart, wondering if  anyone else experienced this?"
5.0,"October 27, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,Replaced an Echo Dot with this in a Master Bathroom and ROCKED this end of the apartment.  Has the same guts as the Echo Plus but in smaller size but I don't detect any loss in audio quality.
5.0,"February 18, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"It’s a Echo Plus speaker without the hub and temperature at a lower price but the speaker and sound are the same. To me that’s a win - win plus sound at a lower price. I don’t care about the hub and temperature, just sound quality and functionality and the new Echo is a winner.  I want to buy another."
3.0,"January 6, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Well, it's just sort of creepy, in a way. I like it because I can ask for weather info, order up music..that IS fun. But, when I'm sitting in the living room talking with my hubs and Echo lights up for no apparent reason during conversation, it just feels weird. We turned off the mic but, shrug.."
5.0,"December 17, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"This one is working much better than my old one, SO FAR...Lots of base tones, almost every song...But it does work...Does not play the same tunes as my old one, lots of songs I never heard of before...Same groups. older tunes..??? Classical rock is one area, most tunes not heard before...Just keep on going forward, easy to do with my remote..."
5.0,"January 24, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I’ve only had it for a week. Consequently, I’m still on the “learning curve”. I find something new every day and am really enjoying the experience!"
1.0,"February 13, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I bought 3 of these to replace my Echo Dots due to the larger size speakers. Unfortunately, they seem to have a few bugs that need worked out. For some reason, they do not pair to the internet as well as the Echo Dots do. They are constantly going offline and need to be reconnected. Amazon needs to fix this issue with some software updates or something"
4.0,"February 10, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Comparing this to my old Echo Dot, the sound quality is certainly better.  But it seems that I have to speak louder for this Echo to get the message.  Also, the old Dot does very well with Follow-Up mode, but this Echo seems to shut down faster.  I often have to re-awaken Alexa for a follow-on request."
5.0,"January 7, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I love this item it so nice to tell it a song to play and it plays it. Also when you wake up you can say Alexa what’s today’s news and it starts playing the news when you set it up you can tell it which news station you want to here. You can always ask it what the weather is going to be today and for the rest of the week. There are to many things that it does to write about.
5.0,"January 18, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,"I purchased this as a Black Friday deal and am glad I did. I needed a second Alexa for my bedroom and this is perfect. I only wish they still had the woodgrain option. My first Alexa has this and I really enjoy how it looks. Otherwise, there is not much else to say. I liked the price and it works perfectly."
5.0,"January 29, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,I like the product and many of its options. I don’t like that the voice is hard to understand. One or two words no problem but sentences are muddy. I’ve trie all the sound settings but is still not clear. Overall though I really like the product. Music is good and clear it’s just the voice that isn’t.
5.0,"November 25, 2019",Sandstone,Echo,We traded up and we like the new Echo.  We were without an Echo for about 6 months and we missed Alexa.  The sound is much better and the content seems more extensive.
2.0,"February 4, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Works great by itself.  This product and the other echo and show products are NOT user friendly.  When hooking up multiple units they just don't seem to want to interact very well. They either get confused, don't respond, or only some speakers will play music when you've told the system to play everywhere. Sometimes it works and other times it doesn't. It's about a 30% failure rate in that aspect. The Alexa firmware needs improvements.  I'll give Amazon another 12 months and if I don't see drastic changes in terms of fluidity I'll be considering a change to Google's system. Get it together Amazon!"
5.0,"December 31, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,Great product. Great sound quality. Ascetically appealing. Works with all my smart home devices. Connects everything together. Overall great purchase. BUT there is one thing I don't like about it. This thing is a speaker. A smart speaker at that. Someone like me with an iPhone cant just open their apple music and click a song and play it over the speaker. Which to me doesn't make sense. But other then that i love it.
2.0,"January 15, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"My only complaint is that it has to be linked to two devices and those two devices have to be right and left speakers. So when I have my two echoes in different rooms but the sub in the room I use most, it doesn’t work. Since one speaker is forced to be setup as left and the other right, when paired with the sub"
5.0,"January 20, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"quality, efficiency, and knowledge are what I like about my new Alexa's.  I have one in every large room of the house, as I have a large house!  Sounds great! Especially helpful with weather and shopping lists.  I love the music also!  Thank You for such an outstanding assistant! Sincerely, DN"
5.0,"December 24, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"This unit is much improved over my first generation Echo, although I do miss the volume ring that was on the original. Voice recognition and the ability of it to hear you over music is much, much better.  Sound quality is also improved, but it goes from good to amazing sound when you pair it with another echo for stereo sound. I paired it with a 2nd gen. Echo plus and it just sounds great! I may add the echo sub at some point but it really doesn't need it once paired and in stereo."
4.0,"February 3, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"The 3rd gen Echo has way better bass than the 3rd gen Dot that I purchased. The reason for three stars is because it lacks mid range sound and at 4 rimes the cost of the Dot I feel it should have better sound quality. Knowing this after the fact, I would have bought four Dots and placed them in different rooms."
5.0,"January 12, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,This thing is awesome! I got the echo and two dots for my kids rooms. Its great. I can set individual reminders for each child. I can send reminders from my cell when im working.  Kids love asking questions and listening to music.its great. I can shut off forgotten lights from my cell. Its great...
5.0,"January 7, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I already have a couple Echo Dots in my house. I added this one to provide better sound when listening to music. What a great addition to our house. And when I turn all my Alexa devices on together to listen to music, the whole house fills with the sound. I'm planning on getting another big Alexa like this one to add even more great music to our house."
5.0,"December 21, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I bought this and was not sure I really wanted it. I mostly wanted a speaker to stream my music while I worked... but oh my god. Alexa is my new love (sorry Siri). One thing I love is how she can add things to my shopping or to-do lists so easily and it goes right into the app. This helps when I lay awake at night unable to sleep because I know I need to make a list of things to do the next day... so I can get it quickly off my mind and go to bed. Well, I loved it so much I bought 2 echo dots. One for the kitchen and one for the kids room so now I can easily drop into the kids room and let them know dinner is ready without having to march up the stairs or scream like a banshee."
5.0,"January 9, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"I just love it! I am French with a very strong accent. I was concerned that Alexa would not be able to get what I ask for. I have absolutely no problem. Anything I ask is understood right away. I just love that Echo! In term of the sound, I wish I could change the bass. Otherwise, I'm very happy with my new gadget."
2.0,"January 3, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I've been a echo owner since the 1st gen... this thing is garbage compared to the 1st gen. Yes, sound quality is way better but it crackles and pops when waking her. It sounds broken, flat out. Tech support says this is normal. Nope, 1st gen did not do this garbage. That's not even the worst part. I use my echos as my preliminary music listening devices. I pay a premium for unlimited and HD music from Amaxon. Both of the latest gen echos I bought randomly disconnect ALL THE TIME and randomly stop playing music for no reason. They're supposed to be new tech, but honestly the 1st gen worked way more flawlessly. Major bugs and kinks that I have zero faith in Amazon addressing before they shove the newest gen dow your throat."
1.0,"January 21, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I was given this as a gift, never asked for it and never wanted it. I’m not a lazy person so for me taking the time to turn in music or the lights or changing the temp is not a task. Alexa really isn’t anything special. So unless someone likes having a device which spies on them I wouldn’t bother."
3.0,"February 20, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,Cannot reliably playback purchased music in my iTunes library that exists inside my iPhone.  It seems to ONLY want to stream music from Amazon Music and other streaming services.  I returned this and bought a simple blue-tooth speaker which works perfectly fine.  Does not seem to play nice at all with Siri/iPhone.
5.0,"January 11, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Far better sound than my old Echo Dot (which is now in another room - for playing lower quality music there).  Easy to set up and sounds great.  I also got the battery base for it so I can unplug from power and take out onto the deck and patio when I want my Alexa and music to go.  Nice system.
4.0,"December 24, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I replaced an Echo dot with this. The bass has a ""tubby"" quality to it: a mid-bass hump or two that comes up short of what I was hoping for in terms of sound quality. Re-positioning doesn't seem to help so it's definitely a manufacturing/tuning issue. Otherwise it works fine as an Alexa device."
4.0,"December 24, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Decided to take the plunge and get an Echo on black friday deal.  I was a bit dubious of how useful it would be, and the jury is still out on that.  Maybe once I hook it up to a bunch of smart devices, its utility will become clearer.  For now, I am impressed with the amount of tech, voice recognition, sound quality in a small package, that you can for a relatively low price.  So far, I'm not disappointed with the purchase."
5.0,"December 10, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I purchased this to replace my echo dot because I wanted better sound.  This speaker really delivered.  It has a full sound with very good bass.  As a bonus, it seems Alexa can hear me better too. Setup was amazingly easy.  I pulled the speaker out of the box and plugged it in.  It seemed to already know my home network."
5.0,"December 26, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"The sound quality is really great at this price point - not to mention that once initially paired w/ the app it’s all voice control from there.  There are better speakers out there for sure, and at varying prices, quality and features...but for everything this is, it simply cannot be beat on sale for only 80 bucks!!!  This replaces my Echo dot paired with an Oontz speaker, and I’m also giving 2 as gifts this year now that I know how awesome it is."
4.0,"December 20, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I have an Echo Dot, which I replaced with this...….Just plugged it up and it was all set.....Could not have been easier to connect...…..Great product!"
5.0,"December 22, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I’m really impressed with the quality of the speaker(s).  Way better than my Bose portable or JBL.  And soooo easy to set up & use.  Alexa is very helpful.  BUT, yesterday I had asked Alexa to wake me up at 6:30 am to happy music.  The music was happy but it was 4:30 AM.  It was a very long day :-("
5.0,"January 15, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Really the same as the other Echos - I needed another one and black Friday was on.... comparing the sound to the tall Echo, 1st Gen, the sound quality is better. I am happy with it. I would like to purchase the Echo with the deeper bass but it will have to wait until Prime Day in the summer."
5.0,"January 3, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,So far I have been using it only for music emails questions Etc. The one that I have now it was a Christmas gift from my son in 2019. Right at this moment I'm going to purchase another one myself. Thank you for asking. About to durability off this item I don't know yet it is too soon to tell.
5.0,"December 5, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I have the 1st gen Echo at home, and I use it as a voice assistant as well as a music speaker to stream my playlist on Spotify. I didn't feel like the audio quality of gen 1 Echo is bad at all until I got this 3rd gen Echo. The audio quality improved a lot. Since I have another 5 Echo Dots (3rd gen) at home, I can now enjoy the whole home audio feature by grouping them up. Nice job, Amazon"
5.0,"October 19, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"EASE TO SET UP. YOU CAN TALK IN DIFFERENT LANGUAJES, 100% RECOMENDED"
5.0,"January 14, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,We are loving it. I never thought I would want one but I love playing music on it. Also we check weather conditions. So easy. Still learning what this device can do.  Alexa is very patient and my Grandkids are getting a kick out of teaching me weird sounds.  This was a Christmas gift to us.
4.0,"January 18, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"My Echo system was a gift and I'm not used to it as yet. It is great to be able to ask for just about any artist or music. But it does things—random sounds and pulsing lights—that I do not understand and I do NOT have the time to ""explore"" a household device! Alexa may be smarter than I need it to be...."
1.0,"November 11, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,This device doesn’t work periodically and will randomly make beep noises.  Reset it and still continues to do the same stuff
5.0,"January 18, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,We love it we have the echo dot also in many rooms of the house I like that I can call it or do an announcement and I can get everyone to come to 1 room or you can play music across the house with them we truly enjoy the fact we can connect to Sirius xm and listen to music we have found sleeping to the xm spa setting make sleeping amazing. It is a must have
4.0,"December 16, 2019",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"This has been the hardest echo device to set up & I've tried everything to set up bluetooth with my phone. Which was a breeze with my other 3 devices. I don't get what I'm missing with this one, but all advice I've found online has been useless. May return if it doesn't pair with my phone!"
5.0,"December 16, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,I got this to upgrade an area in a large room from an Echo Spot to something with a better speaker. This is exactly what I was looking for. The sound is richer and fuller and fills the open space better. I moved the Echo Spot to a bedroom instead and this Echo is perfect in an open concept space.
3.0,"February 23, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Everything is great; the one thing I regret though of not getting the echo studio is that I thought that this echo plus had a its own battery source, knowing that now its a better investment to go with the studio rather than going for the echo plus. Now if you are on a budget but want to start using Alexa this one nails it. Excellent sound quality very powerful speaker."
5.0,"December 31, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"This speakers is awesome i set it up in my room on my desk where my gaming setup is and the speaker is so nice to have, for music, take a call without my phone, also control stuff if you set it up. I got 2 pairs of led's, one under my desk, & one on the back of my Tv that's on the wall and they work great using your voice with Alexa. The speakers surprised me on how much Bass and how good it would play the high's and lo's so, I had to order another Echo lol so I can pair them on my desk & use them as Computer Speakers or just have them for a surround sound and stereo system. Definitely a nice purchase and they always have some room to improve which I won't doubt they will."
4.0,"November 22, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I love my new Echo BUT I wish it came in a metal finish!  I have a lot of dust in my home from living on a dirt road and also have a home full of small, long-haired dogs so having an echo with a CLOTH COVER is far from ideal! I anticipate having difficulty keeping this Echo clean!  I'll update as time goes by."
3.0,"December 7, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,"the  Echo 3 is attractive, unobtrusive and has great sound.  I hoped to use it for background music in my office waiting room but it keeps turning off every few hours.  I can't find anything online that helps me fix the problem - I am told it's my connection but multiple other internet connected devices are having no issues.  Same with Amazon help.  Someone said there was  a firmware upgrade but I've not found it."
3.0,"February 4, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"We have had an echo dot for a long time and used it in our kitchen, mostly for music. We wanted the full size Echo for better sound quality in such a big space. The sound quality is definitely better, but half the time it will shut off in the middle of playing or start to get a fuzzy, static sound. Also, the blue ring will just keep spinning so you can't even give commands to Alexa and ultimately we have to unplug it and restart (which is very inconvenient and annoying). Overall, a good product in theory, but seems to have a lot of glitches."
5.0,"February 3, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,"Echo device arrived in a shipping envelope, which worried me, but thankfully there was no damage to the device and it works exactly as designed. This is a noticeable upgrade from the first generation Echo. The third generation responds much quicker and keeps a steady and reliable connection with my wifi. Highly recommended!"
5.0,"November 18, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,First buyer and user of such a product. Very easy set up. Outstanding sound quality for music. I bought this one for in my bedroom to try it out during our kitchen remodel. So impressed I am keeping it in the bedroom and buying another one. Installed smart switch and the unit picked it up and works turning lights on and off.
5.0,"January 23, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I really Like the voice control and asking questions. Music plays well, wish it was a little louder, but not bad. What I don't Like it she makes noises when I don't Want her to. If I haven't Talked to her she will make noises to remind me she’s there. I know You’re there Alexa, sometimes let me have my quiet time. I am Glad I purchased Alexa.  I would Like to however rename her, but can’t find that’s an option."
3.0,"January 27, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"Constantly turns off or cuts in and out (and no it’s not our internet). Eventually it just stops responding to our voice at all and the only way to get it to work is to unplug it for a few seconds and then plug it back in to reset it. We have to unplug it several times a week, some times even a couple times a day."
1.0,"January 7, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I am hearing impaired with hearing aids. This unit has absolutely poor sound quality. Could not distinguished the broadcasted speech. After much frustration,  donated to a day care center classroom. A better Investment would be into a separate speaker combined with the smaller echo dot."
5.0,"December 5, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,We had an Echo Dot but upgraded it. This one is awesome!!  The sound is way better then the dot. We love it!  Very happy we upgraded.
5.0,"January 10, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"It was easy to set up. We don't have but one ""smart"" device set up but it's fun to play with. At this point it's just a toy. Amazon had an offer for new Echo buyers for a 99cent smart plug which we took advantage of. We're using it for our living room table lamp. Like I said, it's fun!"
5.0,"January 8, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"Works great!  Answers questions, tells jokes, and plays music. Times your lights off and on while you’re away. Turns on your bedside lamp when the alarm goes off. Can be programmed for one time, by the day, for weekdays or weekends. Will choose a playlist for you or order from Amazon! Can’t wait to learn more."
4.0,"December 30, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"The Echo was easy to set up and was working in a matter of minutes. We’re enjoying discovering all it can do. We bought some smart plugs and those too were easy to get up & running. Lots of good music we’re enjoying also. The jokes are pretty corny, which is funny in itself."
5.0,"December 19, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Being new to this device, I have not fully utilized the full functions.  Was reasonable easy to set up out of  the box especially for old people like me.  Voice recognition is good, sound is great, and I really like the ability to get Alexis to play any variation of music I request.  Whether by artist, exact song, or general categories.  No more changing of CD's or finding music to play."
5.0,"December 6, 2019",Charcoal,with $10 Smart Plug,Great sound. so great that I ended up replacing my radio with it. The sound is very loud for what it is and its size. Great bass out if it too. Much better than the Echo Dots. This is great for a large area and/or as your primary audio device in a main room. The dots are good for secondary rooms ie. bedrooms.
4.0,"January 14, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"We have a dot or echo in most every room. I love them for whole house music, but I am having difficulty getting it to recognize the distinct voices in my family. This means that when I asked for my most liked songs, I get my daughter's playlist. I can deal until Lana Del Rey covers Sublime. :("
4.0,"December 27, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Nice, now I need one for the other room. Although I paid for upgraded Amazon music, I can’t get any of the music I like on it, so have to look into other subscription services. But it was easy to set up w only one call to customer service. And I am totally hopeless with technology."
3.0,"January 14, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"It was nice upgrade except it kept saying ""something went wrong please try again later"" my 1st Gen never did that, also the remote would pair but kept disconnecting and reconnecting making a tone each time waking me up. Sent it back added the 1st Gen back up no issues at all since."
5.0,"January 15, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Two more makes three. Easy to order, delivered impossibly quickly, brilliant packaging, east to set up. Whats not to like? Now theres one on each floor of my house, and i can enable ""play music everywhere"" mode, filling the house with soft music when the mood strikes. I like these!"
5.0,"February 13, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"I love my new echo, as it serves as a great morning partner while  getting ready for my day. I get my  news briefing and weather, as well as get me connected to some good music to get me in a good mood for the day ahead. It is big enough to lend some nice sound, but unobtrusive amongst the toothbrushes, paste, hairbrushes etc. This is an update to our previous echo, the newer one looks much nicer."
5.0,"January 17, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I do not own an I- phone or pad or whatever they are called. On line instructions on my Apple computer offer little help , apparently amazon believes everyone is an owner of those devices. I will need to hire someone sophisticated enough to make the connection to the App.I am sure it is a great product however."
5.0,"January 27, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"This is the second ""Alexa"" we have purchased. We now have one on each floor of the house. The sound quality is very good, regardless of what musical genre you enjoy. My husband and I are not ""techies"", but this is a cool device that is easy to operate.  All you need to do is talk."
4.0,"January 9, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"Easy access to news, information, music and even entertaining jokes. I'm still becoming familiar with all the things I can do with Alexa. I don't have any home functions connected, such as thermostat, lights, etc., so I can't comment on it although it seems to be something handy to have. I was disappointed to not be able to download the app to my phone. It just wouldn't work for some reason. However, I successfully got connected with my laptop."
5.0,"January 2, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I had one of the very 1st Echo's, but it did not survive my granddaughter's oops this Christmas. Bought the new one and it's even better !!  The sound quality is great, and the continued new things Alexa can do is also great. She is almost kinda part of the family, as we call her name numerous times every day."
2.0,"January 20, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Every single time I ask Alexa to do something she says ""there was a problem"" and I have to repeat the command it's ridiculous. No it's not my network. I understand we are at the birth of voice command technology but If I purchase it I expect it to do what the description states."
5.0,"January 5, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Since I didn't own the previous generations, I have nothing to compare it to.  However, never owning one before, I can honetly say that the sound quality for such a small device is huge.  It also works well with my Harmony Hub to operate nearly everything in my home, on command."
5.0,"January 11, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I've had an echo dot for a few years and wanted something with a better speaker system. This does the trick! I listen to my audible books while cleaning the house or cooking dinner and the speaker is loud enough for me to hear over running water in the sink while washing dishes.
4.0,"January 3, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I upgraded from 1st Gen.  to the 3rd Gen. due to newer hardware and because the 1st Generation wasn’t working as smoothly. Set up was super easy. If you are up grading, there no need to type in your network info. Because your info is already in your account   The Echo tech that helped me was very patient and worked with me for over 2hrs. He went above and beyond. We tried every situation to hook the 1st Gen to the different groups of speakers. Firgured that there was something wrong with it. Or, it was getting to old. 3rd Gen sounds even better than the original ECHO"
1.0,"December 22, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Intermittent playback issues plague this device. Amazon replaced the first one, only to have the same issues with the new one. I might just return it and find something else. It’s a shame. Our 2nd and 3rd gen Echo Dots work really well. Hopefully they can work these issues out."
5.0,"February 18, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I bought this as an upgrade from my first generation echo.  First of all, aesthetically it is better than the original.  But what really impressed me was the sound quality.  I use my echo to listen to siriusxm radio or music on other streaming sites.  The sound quality is great.  Happy I purchased."
4.0,"January 29, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I like this version of Alexa,  the audio sounds great ands the price was perfect.  I have Alexa in control of most IOT electronics in my house and it is very capable at managing these things.  The last few weeks though Alexa will cut out mid sentence or stop listening to me halfway through mine.  Otherwise no complaints,  works good, sounds good,  integrates fairly easily."
5.0,"January 29, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"We got echo dots for our children, and I knew I had to have one too. Wanted better sound quality and I got it! Love listening to music throughout the day and having much knowledge one voice command away. We haven't yet delved into all Alexa can do, but it's going great so far."
5.0,"January 2, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Just love Alexa products.  This is the THIRD Alexa in this home and one Echo Dot too.  The Dot is OK, but no match for sound quality from these Echo devices.  Bought two LED bulbs for the front room, they were a pain to install from that company, but they got us through it and Echo turns on/off and dims the lamps on command.  All devices also tell us if someone is @ the front door."
5.0,"January 10, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I like the functionality and Alexa providing ""tips"" to make operations simpler. At the same time, I just got it so am trying to figure out what commands will allow me to ""turn on music with a timer of 8 hours"". It seems Alexa may have some difficulty with multiple commands.  She either sets the music or sets the timer, but I haven't been able to get her to understand what I think is a simple ""play music for 8 hours"" command. Also, the yellow light ""notifications"" sometimes get caught in a loop with this odd sound until I ask Alexa to play notifications.  I can probably control this in settings."
5.0,"January 1, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"The sound quality of the speaker is quite amazing considering the size. Alexa's voice is also pleasing. The playlists that are available are just superb. Also, Alexa was able to answer absolutely any question we have asked. Great for local weather forecasts as well."
5.0,"February 4, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,"I set an alarm that didn't go off. I have no way of knowing what I did wrong or if Alexa just didn't understand - even though she repeated back to me what I asked. So no relying on Alexa for alarms, but everything else is great. Excellent sound system good voice recognition."
5.0,"December 29, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Great sound quality that fills a room beautifully. Music sounds crisp and bass is perfect. Also, Alexa is pretty awesome. It was a little difficult for me to figure out how everything worked at first, but as you play around in the app, it becomes clearer. Very happy with this purchase!"
5.0,"January 2, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,"We had the 2nd Gen for a few years and we loved the volume control twist at the top.  The 3rd Gen does not have that twist control, but the sound quality is much better than the previous Gen.  We do enjoy this product and it is a great value, especially if you pair it with  Fire 4k."
5.0,"January 25, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Sound is excellent. Amazon Music Unlimited is the way to go. Endless music selections. Alexa is also fun to ""communicate"" with. Depending on what you ask and how you ask it you get different answers. I have asked her to marry me three times using a different tone of voice and words. The first response was ""Thanks, but I like my current situation"". The second was ""Sorry, but I think that is against robotic law"". Both responses were in kind of a sweet tone. The third response in a stern tone was "" It can not be, for you are of the earth and I am of the cloud"". My wife is getting jealous of the new woman in my life. LOL"
5.0,"December 11, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,This is an excellent device with great sound quality.  I recently added this to my stable of echo dots and one echo plus.  Fast and easy setup since I already have all of those other Alexas known to my WIFI.  I bought the blue one.  It looks more gray than blue but whatev.
5.0,"February 5, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I had a first generation that I really enjoyed however this one is so much better. The speaker quality is excellent. The sound is high quality. Makes listening to my Amazon music play lists very enjoyable! This was given as a gift for Christmas and I am very happy with it.
5.0,"January 22, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,The sound out of this compact speaker is fantastic. The bass is rich the mid-notes and highlights are clear. It can also be adjusted in the equalizer in the alexa app. I got the twilight blue color and really like it. The only echo speaker that outplays this is the studio.
5.0,"December 15, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"The sensitive microphones pick up your voice much better than the echo dot. Alexa can hear your commands even if playing loud music.  For its size, this has room filling sound with a nice balance of lows and highs.  Excellent for music playback. Highly recommend this device."
5.0,"October 24, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,"WOW! That is the first thing once i heard the sound quality coming from this new 3rd gen. Echo. A 100% improvement from 2nd gen, and there is nothing terribly wrong with the 2nd gen either, its just the took it up a few levels with the sound on this model. Now I have only had this a few hours, so if my opinion changes which it more than likely wont, or if more things I discover about the new gen. I will try to update."
5.0,"January 26, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Not being an audiophile, I do not need the best of the best.  But I have to say, the pairing of these little speakers provides an impressive range of excellent sound in my bedroom.  I would consider the sub woofer, but there is no place to put it.  Very happy camper here."
5.0,"November 15, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I replaced a Gen 1 Echo with this new model. The installation was as easy as logging in and it self configured.  I didn't voice train it but I don't have any problems with response. Overall, the sound is a bit softer than the other and the look doesn't stand out. So far I like it."
5.0,"November 9, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Traded in my 1st gen model for this one.  Nicer styling, sounds fuller, mics pick up my voice better and further.  Even has a audio in/out jack which 1st gen lacked.  Only con is midrange could be stronger, even after equalizing in the Alexa app.  Overall, very satisfied."
4.0,"January 7, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I purchased a dot a year ago as a way to enter into the smart speaker venue. I couldn’t believe how much we ended up using it. My family listens to music a lot, and I thought this would be better to have in the kitchen, which is a larger area. The sound is better than the dot (although I was still impressed with the dot), the bass is deeper and I feel like it has a bigger range. I would recommend this for anyone wanting something a little more than a dot for music."
5.0,"December 22, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo," Indiscutiblemente me enamoro mi Echo alexa es lo mejor que pudieron inventar, buen sonido te ayuda en muchas cosa este aparato me encantó tanto que ya llevo tres comprado, uno para mi hijo uno para mi hermana y el mio😀 de verdad se lo recomiendo totalmente"
5.0,"February 4, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,"I bought two of these at a specially discounted price, and my wife and daughter couldn't be happier. My daughter now feels like she has her own stereo system for her room, and my wife has been dancing around the kitchen requesting/singing show tunes - what's not to like?"
5.0,"February 19, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I've been using my new Alexa to listen to music on Amazon since I set up.  The sound quality can't be beat.  I've used it to listen radio station BBC 94.9 FM in London, UK.  I get current temperatures and weather forecasts using Alexa.  I love my Alexa Echo 3rd generation."
2.0,"December 13, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,Super sad..... I have about 8 Amazon smart audio devices. Clearly I drink the Alexa koolaid but..... The sound on the echo 3 just sucks.  They got everything else right as an upgrade but the muffled audio is painful to the ears. True shame.  Almost a throwaway :(
5.0,"January 11, 2020",Sandstone,with $10 Smart Plug,"It just works.  Alexa is great and she knows it (PS...so does Amazon).  I have a Gen 2 and the sound quality on Gen 3 is much better.  It wasn't bad before, but it's noticeable. Only negative...It'll make you lazy.  I go to my parents house and I have to actually physically turn on a light switch or use a remote control to turn stuff on...I mean the nerve! Any who, you won't regret buying it.  Just make sure to get some smart outlets as well...totally ups her game."
4.0,"January 1, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Likes - good interaction with Amazon account IE - playing music   -Excellent sound quality   -Very easy to set up and use, Dislikes - tries to sell me more stuff   - limited AI more like a good voice search tool with links to Amazon features and plug in home apps. Good value for price, I was hoping for a higher level  of AI, still a good tool, particularly with the Amazon interface"
5.0,"December 6, 2019",Charcoal,with $10 Smart Plug,Bought this on black friday. I upgraded from Echo - Gen 1. I must say its smaller and better. I love the looks with fabric exterior instead of plastic body. I definitely feel difference in sound and base. The Amazon Smart Plug was freebie which i plan to use for table lamp. Love this.
5.0,"February 8, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,I am a big fan of Echo/Alexa devices. They make my life so much easier. I sync my Ring cameras and house lights up with Alexa. I also love linking all my Echos to play the same music in all room’s I move around the house a lot and and listing to music seamlessly is nice.
5.0,"February 1, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Finally decided to trade in my 1st-gen Echo for this one, and wow was I surprised.  The sound is a bit crisper and cleaner when compared to the older model, and the added bass was much needed and really puts out for such a small speaker.  Seems to work just as well or better than the 1st-gen models with any functions or apps I use.  Definitely satisfied with this purchase."
3.0,"November 12, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"We had a lot of trouble getting her to connect to Spotify and Apple Music instead of Amazon Music. We gave up after a bit and tried again after an update and then it worked. The echo also gives you a lot of ads after using an app, and we have to constantly tell her to stop even though we have tried to set preferences to have that feature off. Also, the app glitches a lot."
4.0,"January 21, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I received this as a present, and so far have mostly basic services with it. I think it will be more useful the more I learn, but am using it quite a bit now. The only fault I see at this point is it's ability to recognize what you are asking for if you don't always use the precise term it is looking for. For example, when I receive a message on it, and try to delete it after heard, if I say delete message- it refers me to the help on my Alexa app. But if I say delete notifications, then it will happily delete it without further actions on my part. It needs to know that a message and notification is the same. Very happy with it so far!"
5.0,"December 25, 2019",Sandstone,Echo,Great upgrade from previous versions. Tech support is lacking severely. When calling you get indian support that is extremely basic. The speaker itself is great high treble and low bass not too big and not too small. Looks great in any setting with the color options.
1.0,"December 27, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Frrequently shouts out that its connected to my computer. Returning this until an option is added to turn this ANNOYING ""feature"" can be turned off in Settings. Amazon has known about it for years now, and hasn't lifted a finger. Whoever put it on the Echo should be fired."
5.0,"February 9, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,I have become a raving fan of Amazon’s Alexa. I am fussy about sound quality and can say this latest model is an improvement.  I love it.  I also own the latest dot which I use in my bedroom.  Definitely the larger Echo has better sound quality but J love them both.
4.0,"January 7, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,We got a black friday deal on the Echo 3rd gen and are happy with it for the price we paid.  It sounds good and is easy to set up like all other amazon products.  My only complaint is that Alexa is behind Siri and Google when it comes to understanding questions and responding correctly.
5.0,"October 31, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"This product is excellent.  Such a great sound.  I only listen to music with my Alexa.  I also have her in my car.  I will get rid of Sirius radio, as I have many playlists.  The problem is that I'm too dependent on using Alexa.  I have one in each of my rooms in my house.  Fantastic product!!"
5.0,"January 4, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Purchased myself a Christmas gift when it was on sale.  I am enjoying deciding the type of music to listen to, and the convenience of turning on my chair-side lamp without having to get up.  (I purchased a smart plug combo.)  I love the blue color, as well.  Color options were a smart marketing decision..."
3.0,"January 13, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I have 2 Echo Dots and love them.  Wanted to step up to 3rd generation and expected better for the price paid.  My Echo Dot responds much faster and hears more accurately than the pricier model.  I have the Echo in the exact same spot that my Echo Dot was in.  I struggle with Alexa.  I love the idea of a better speaker as we do play a lot of music but not impressed yet.
5.0,"February 11, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,"I love this and all of my echoes.  I travel with them and give them as gifts now.  My 99 year old Mom was really struggling with the streaming music concept - we tried everything and everything frustrated and upset her, until I finally convinced her to let me get her one.  She has access to music she hasn’t been able to find in decades.  She plays her music all day - and now she’s having fun asking questions, jokes, etc.  Next we’ll get her to start using it to order from Prime.  Thank you!"
5.0,"January 22, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,"I’ve had her for 2 months now and she is great. Connects to my tv, Xbox, sound system and she does great. I did have my doubts in the beginning but they are all gone. Voice recognition is amazing she recognizes everything I say, knows exactly what song to look up if I don’t know the name but the artist, or vice versa, I recommend"
5.0,"February 20, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I love the easy, plug and play setup on this speaker!  I have some older echo dots, but wanted a clearer sound, and this speaker delivers!  It took me less than 2 minutes to set up the speaker and connect it to my wi-fi.  The sound is a HUGE improvement over the dots!"
3.0,"December 11, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"When linked to my Samsung TV via Bluetooth, there is about a 1/2 sec delay between the picture and the sound. The TV has an audio delay adjustment for ""compatible audio devices"". Apparently this device is not compatible.  It's too bad because the sound is amazing."
3.0,"January 25, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"The speaker is really convenient but incredibly glitchy. It uses a lot of bandwidth so it will cause the WiFi to slow or stop completely. It recognizes voice commands readily but will fail to follow instructions about 20% of the time. Also, I have to restart it often because the sounds turns to static while I’m streaming video. It may be that I got a defective unit, and I would probably buy it again, but I won’t expect it to be exactly what I’d hoped for."
5.0,"January 11, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"I love my Alexa! The sound quality of this speaker is great. It doesn’t sound crackly when you turn it up all the way. The voice commands work perfectly especially with other devices connected like my smart bulbs, switches, & even my Roku tv! I have an echo dot as well & they work great paired up so that I can listen to music in multiple rooms at the same time. 2020 is cool 😎"
5.0,"January 16, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I mine as well throw out my other blue tooth speakers. This one sounds better, voice recognition works well, and with Amazon music it plays anything I want to hear. I’m planning on getting a second one to put on the other side of the room or maybe for the garage."
5.0,"October 21, 2019",Sandstone,Echo,"This one replaced my original Echo. At once, I was surprised at the improvement in sound. Definitely it's a value to buy."
2.0,"February 16, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"The Echo makes random noise 24/7 so I have to unplug it to sleep. It does occasionally act correctly as a timer. I wouldn't trust it to be an alarm clock or do anything automatically.  I have owned an Echo that worked for a few years, so this is a disappointment."
5.0,"January 10, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I received my Alexa as a Christmas gift and I love it! I had been wanting one for a long time! I love being able to play music just by asking Alexa and the thunderstorm sounds is so relaxing! I know there’s much more you can do with it and I intend to try it all!
5.0,"December 28, 2019",Twilight Blue,with $10 Smart Plug,This is our fourth or fifth Alexa product and it’s the most responsive yet. We use this in the bathroom for music in the shower- and it’s the first one that I don’t have to yell outside of the shower to get it to skip a song. Amazing sound. Very good value for the price!
5.0,"November 9, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,Alex can hear me better when I say her name over music or noise. I don’t have to speak louder which is nice.  Better sound than my 1st generation.
5.0,"December 21, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,Love our new Echo! We upgraded from the smaller Echo Dot b/c we read the sound was better in the Echo. My son listens to music through it all the time. Setup was extremely simple and as soon as we got it going we were totally impressed!! Music sounds even better than expected!
5.0,"December 22, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,Amazon is the only way to go when you need to purchase that product you’re looking for at a great price. Shipping is very quick and your product is packaged for protection.  Products work as advertised and meets or exceeds my expectations. Highly recommend Echo Smart Speaker!!!
5.0,"December 29, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,I must say this is an excellent product. The sound and quality are superb! I would definitely buy more if I had a larger place. You can sync up anything on Amazon/Alexa/even bluetooth! The ability also to see what it would look like in your place was very very helpful!
5.0,"January 7, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Best Christmas gift I've gotten in years!.  Love the convenience of finding information.  Especially like listening to music.  Never expected the great sound quality.  Like the responsiveness to my voice even at a distance.  Will definitely purchase as gift for others.
5.0,"December 3, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"The sound on this thing surprised me for its size. I keep the volume between 5-7 out of 10 max, and that's loud and clear enough to fill my medium-sized living roon. Alexa works great, and no complaints there. It would've been nice if it had an internal rechargeable battery, but also makes sense to keep it in your house plugged in the whole time."
5.0,"January 25, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,It works as expected; excellent sound quality so it's great for a room speaker. I was able to pair it with my FireTv stick and can use it as a remote for my Amazon Prime Video service.  Looking forward to pairing it with more bluetooth devices as a controller.
2.0,"December 24, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Sounds quality is good. But I purchased so I can link them as is self described for the Echo. Stereo sounds basically. Well that worked, but if you are using Bluetooth to listen to music from your phone, it does not play on both Echo’s in stereo. It only plays on one. That needs to be redesigned."
5.0,"February 9, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Does not seem to respond as quickly as the Echo Plus. It also seems a bit “less than” in overall sound quality. I’d gotten it, so I could sink audio with my Echo Plus and that’s been a struggle. Still a great piece of equipment, just outshined by the Echo Plus."
5.0,"January 20, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,It was a beautiful gift from a dear friend.  I love Alexa! I'm retired military and it  plays reveille in the morning and retreat in the evening and lastly the Star Spangled Banner.. I understand Alexa is a product from the United States Air Force. Thank you Alexa!
5.0,"December 29, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Nothing is perfect really, but this is a pretty cool device. It actually does a lot more than I really thought. I got it as a gift for my husband who is super techie. It has a lot of cool features that we plan to take advantage of. I suggest putting it on its own network just so that it's more secure."
4.0,"January 26, 2020",Twilight Blue,with $10 Smart Plug,I love the Alexa; I bought it while it was on sale for Black Friday and it was definitely worth the money. It's the only thing that actually helps me wake up in the morning and get out of bed! It's great for daily reminders which can be set up through the Alexa app. It plays all the music I ask it to and is even able to be linked with my Spotify account (and others but I don't use other ones). Occasionally it misinterprets what I say but it's good for nearly everything it promises!
5.0,"February 15, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,This is our third echo. We got it for our 5 year old for her birthday and she loves it!  The speaker is good and allows her to play music in her room. She also likes asking Alexa questions. Sometimes we link them all together to have music all over the house.
5.0,"December 30, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Alexa is new to us. We couldn’t believe what great sound it gives us and how easy it is to use. Very impressed. So much so - that we got a second echo dot for our kitchen, a larger echo for the living room, an echo show 5” for our bedroom and an echo auto."
5.0,"January 24, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Been using a dot for a couple years. This is a huge improvement obviously. But it’s also much better than the 2nd generation echo that my roomies use. Sound is good and a fine replacement for my old bluetooth speaker. Wish it had a built in battery though.
1.0,"December 11, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,Super disappointed! We upgraded our original Amazon Tap for the Echo. I was after a few of the features like drop-in and better sound BUT then I went to go grab Echo and bring her outside as I often do with my Tap and it DOESN'T WORK!!! I guess it has to be plugged in?!? I am SO SO disappointed.
5.0,"January 10, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,This is my first Echo / Alexa unit. I found it easy to use and easy to install. The unit has broad capability and it seems that virtually all of the Smart Technology are scrambling  to get on the “Alexa Band Wagon” causing wider versatility in its ability.
5.0,"January 4, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,There is absolutely NOTHING not to love about this echo. We use it allllll the time. For reminders. Lists. Music. Questions. Even calling my contacts in my phone. There's so much. Alexa has definitely made things easier for us. I recommend it to everyone.
5.0,"December 4, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I have been a prime member for a good 3-4 years now and i’m just now starting to get into the Echo ecosystem. I recently visited a friends house with a SONOS system and was very impressed with the quality/immersion and how you can play music throughout the entire house. However, I did NOT want to spend upwards of a GRAND on a couple speakers. The Echo speakers are not only a fraction of what a SONOS system would cost, but they provide MORE features than the SONOS. Thanks Amazon you’ve done it again. Very happy with these smart speakers. It’s even better with the Echo Sub! ;)"
5.0,"January 12, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Using it mainly as a music system even though I know it can do much more. My favorite thing about it is if I have a song in my mnd, I can ask Alexa and hear the song immediately,  in most cases. Sometimes you have to be subscribed to their premium music service to hear a certain song."
3.0,"December 20, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"It doesn’t work as well as the one that I got previously, the sounds is not as good, I have to make more then one request of the same command. I’m not as happy with it as the one I got years ago."
1.0,"February 11, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"My daughter bought this for me in case I fall I can ask her to call my son that lives close.  She is very helpful for anything I ask for, the temps,  the weather,  or I set her to remind me of something.  I really like it. She will also play music for me."
4.0,"December 20, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Sounds pretty good.  I am looking forward to getting a Studio some time.  There was a bit of base rumble, but I put a few felt pads on the bottom and all is well.  I still prefer the volume ring, but I guess that I will get over it sometime.  I do like the size better than version 1."
4.0,"February 4, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,The wifi does not seem to connect through our wifi extenders so we're unable to use this throughout the house but it works well within the area it does connect to wifi.  Not sure why it won't connect trough our wifi extenders since other electronics do.
5.0,"February 7, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Was late to join the personal assistant craze but so glad I did. In addition to playing a variety of music that I might not otherwise listen to, she now turns on my tv, my home surveillance cameras, opens/closes my driveway gate and raises and lowers my thermostat from the comforts of my bed or couch."
2.0,"January 24, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"This 3rd gen does not recognize my voice as well as Gen 1. In same exact location. Same most common command, ""Open NPR"". I wind up screaming at it. The bass audio is better, and it's cuter than than my former black tower. I bought it on sale. Not sure I can recommend this generation. May be a lemon."
5.0,"December 10, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"The Echo is easy to set up and use. I started using it with Amazon Music, which comes with Amazon Prime, that I have not had the chance to use until now. Now I don't know how I could have lived without Echo for so long. Perfect Christmas gift for myself. Love it."
5.0,"January 7, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"This technology will continue to evolve and become easier to customize.  I use it mostly to play SiriusXM in the house without the need for a second subscription or equipment.  Every now and then Alexa doesn't quite understand some request, but nothing major.  You can't expect it to know much past its programming."
2.0,"January 3, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I had an earlier Alexa product that I loved.  Once it was uncharged I could unplug it and carry it around the house with me.  I used it for music and news, mostly, as well as occasional info queries.  I am disappointed with this new Echo.  It has much better sound quality than the old one.  But it is bulky and heavy and does not have a battery.  So I find myself rarely using it.  When I do unplug it and carry it to a new outlet, it takes too long to charge up and become responsive.  I will need to get a battery attachment, but that will only add more bulk & weight -- and cost!"
5.0,"January 2, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Nice color choices, and I like the new size/form-factor as well. I have one of each gen, including the dots, and this has the best sound in my opinion. It has less fullness than the Sonos One I also have, but still nice in a small-to-mid sized room."
5.0,"February 6, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I really like the echo 3rd gen. The speaker sounds a little weaker than a BOSE I have. You also have to pay for prime music if you want to listen to a bigger playlist of the artist you're trying to listen to. Other than that I really like the purchase i made.
5.0,"January 12, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Alexa was exactly as described.  The sound quality is outstanding.  I've already created Playlists, Reminders and directions, i.e., ""Alexa, turn off the Living Room Lights"".  Alexa is fabulous.  I don't know how I did without her for so long.  I'm still expanding her capabilities."
4.0,"December 11, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,Music sounds much better than the echo dot.  You can actually hear the base notes and the sound doesn't break up much at all.  I do hear more distortion on the echo dot.  We have this in the kitchen and the carries very well throughout the first floor.  I gave it 4 stars since I am looking for even better sound.  Would need a bigger system for that.
4.0,"February 4, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"This echo has a nice sound , the bass is not so punchy but is not bad either, I have a sony xb31 and the sound is pretty similar,  obviously sony is better. My knly complaint is the bluetooth huh is hard to make it work everytime that i need it"
1.0,"December 3, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I cant get it to connect. I also have google home and it took 60 seconds to download the app, connect to bluetooth, and use. I've been trying with thisnalwxa for 30 minutes and all it does is load."
4.0,"February 10, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I like very much the Alexa Echo (3ª generación), it sounds good, it recognizes the voice and it is of quality, but I understand that it is not of easy use, it only works with Wifi connection in both devices (App Alexa Mobile and Alexa) and it only must be used plugged, I had to resort to a battery to use it without being plugged. I give you a good evaluation because independently of those details that I mention it is a good speaker."
2.0,"January 22, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I ordered a smart plug for the introductory price of $.99 to try it out.  As I checked my Visa notification I saw that I was charged $75.95.  I immediately phoned Amazon to question the charge and was told Alexa had ordered four of the smart plugs.  I told the Amazon operator that I had ordered only one smart plug for $.99, he said that there was an error in the voice communication.  I asked him to amend my order to just the introductory smart plug and adjust the total, but he replied that he was unable to.  Either it was a scam or the voice identification needs refining."
5.0,"January 6, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"This is our 5th Alexa product.  We are hooked!  I've also gifted Alexa devices to 5 different people.  Once you have it, you'll never know how you did without.  If you are concerned with security, turn off the microphone when you're not using it."
4.0,"January 26, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Great device but would like to hear better richer sound quality. Apple Home Pod still easily beats it in sound. If they can improve this with its growing array of smart features it will be amazing. Would also like to see everywhere play implemented if possible with all apps and not just a select few.
3.0,"December 24, 2019",Sandstone,Echo,"The sound quality is excellent and the Alexa function is great. However, there is one serious flaw of the echo. When playing music over Bluetooth, the volume is extremely low. It needs to turn all the way up to have a reasonable volume for music. But by then, the Alexa volume is way too loud. Sadly, there is no way to sync the volume level of the music and Alexa. Another minor glitch is when playing amazon music to stereo pair of echo, there is always a few seconds of noise before the music starts. It would be to mute them before the music starts."
3.0,"January 28, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I love the design and the look.  It's wider however but the sound is no match for the original 1st gen echo. I dropped my 1st gen echo 1 too many times and it broke so I ordered this one thinking I was upgrading... not better but will do the job
5.0,"December 23, 2019",Twilight Blue,with $10 Smart Plug,"Well it might seem weird rating a product so highly but it is very impressive. The bass on the echo is amazing and the sound of music and Alexa is so clear and perfect. And the smart plug it came with made me so happy I got 3 more. So now I say Alexa turn off bedroom light while lying in bed. Ahhh makes things weird when I go to my parents, I almost tell Alexa to turn off the lights but there isn’t one lol. Anyway I soon got an echo dot in the living room to pair in the app so I can turn off and on my living room and bedroom lights. And having all Amazon products streamlines everything."
5.0,"December 28, 2019",Heather Gray,with $10 Smart Plug,"Super impressed by the sound. Deep bass, and clear highs and lows. Louder doesn't muddle any sound quality. Having BT connectivity issues with my iPad from the system settings. It doesn’t pick it up even though the iPad is recognized on the Alexa app. Only plays through app even though iPad is updated."
4.0,"December 30, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Definitely an upgrade in sound quality from my Echo first generation. I was expecting a little more low end from the speaker, but it's not bad. Also does not respond as easily as Gen one, so I have to speak louder, but not bad at all. I love the look and ease to set up. Currently considering the Echo Studio."
4.0,"January 14, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I received this as a gift.  My partner works opposite shift and it's nice to have something to ask questions, the weather, different word games, when the house gets too quiet.  setting timers for food and alarms is easy and speaking the words.  I enjoy a interesting fact, daily when I say good morning."
5.0,"October 22, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,The new Echo has a much deeper and richer sound than the original Echo.  It was very easy to connect with my WiFi  We switched from black to twilight Blue and prefer the new look.  Very happy.  What I would like to see is for the App to be more user friendly and intuitive.
5.0,"December 24, 2019",Sandstone,with $10 Smart Plug,Lots of bugs connection issues running a pair in stereo.  Sometimes songs stop in the middle to start another one.  Other times one speaker keeps playing and the other speaker start playing something else in the middle of a song.  I hope Amazon fixes this.
4.0,"January 15, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I’m liking the quality of the music so far. But, I’m trying out HD music at the same time. With this, I’m not sure if the music is simply louder or more distinct.  I paid $60.00 for this, it seems a fair price for the quality.  Don’t pay more."
5.0,"December 10, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Has a GREAT sound. Excellent for music now. Was able to pair a headset. I needed some tech support, called Amazon & was able to resolve my issue & also helped me pair a Bluetooth headset, which works great. I love the new Dolby 360 sound."
4.0,"January 15, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Forced to unplug to make certain not ""overhearing"" our conversations. While unplugged, the unit would suddenly ""come alive"" and the blue light appeared briefly, scaring us because of another report that these units can make an unauthorized call."
5.0,"February 21, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"The brochure that came with the product was minimal at best. They could expand to tell the new owner exactly what Alexa can do.  Read a book, give a reminder. I keep finding new ways to use Alexa, but it would be a step ahead to publish uses."
5.0,"December 23, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"The speaker works as described.  But, I unplug it when not in use.  I understand that it records your conversations.  And, you have no way to delete or access what it records.  Can we believe that little red button keeps it from recording us?"
5.0,"February 19, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"never thought i have one of the devices in my home, i now have 4 and the are great. they control my lights and outlets and my door locks and cameras, i even have one at my other house in Tennessee !!!! i like them and not had any issues ever."
4.0,"February 22, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"The Smart Speaker ""echo"" is a big improvement over the Echo - hockey puck.  This product eliminates the need to depend on a blue tooth or another small speaker.  Yes, it does not deliver stereo sound, but sitting here on my desk it works well."
3.0,"January 5, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"When I first got this item as a gift, I thought it was really cool.  A few days later, Alexa did not respond to my voice at all.  The lights came on but shut off immediately after I asked her to play some music.  Last night, I asked her to play a specific artist.  She stated that she could not unless I pay, but she could play something similar.  The entire hour she played something similar, the music was static, and came in and out.  Have called my son several times since he gave me the item as a gift.  He said he didn't know why the item would be acting up.  No longer amused by this item."
3.0,"February 18, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I have 2 of these at my house, I bought them so my mom can easily listen to music. Can’t for the life of me get the 2 to sync in 2 rooms. I have a lot of Amazon tec in my house and my girlfriend’s. Most of it set up easily, including 2 of the Fire TV DVRs."
5.0,"December 12, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,The sound quality when combined with Amazon music is absolutely top shelf. I usually purchase bose speakers but I must say this is same as or greater than in quality! My advice is that after you buy it you go into the settings and tweet the bass up just a bit.
5.0,"January 7, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,We got this for my mom for Christmas because she has vision problems and it was hard for her to see the time and with this she can ask her what time it is and any other information that she needs that she can’t really see to find out. She loves it she’s always asking it questions and playing music on it.
2.0,"January 16, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Paired with the sub and the plan is another Echo gen 3 for stereo. I bought these units to connect with my 4 K Fire Tv. They fail after hours of support help. Software upgrade is not helping. The sound with the sub is good for music but a soundbar can do that. Going to a new soundbar . Alexa fails to live up to its name.
5.0,"October 19, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,This sound quality is solid and is exactly the improvements that were needed from previous generations.
5.0,"January 17, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"Sound quality is very much improved over previous generations. The limited edition color is great and fits our kitchen better than the black. Overall, You know what Alexa can do. May as well have one that looks good to show off."
5.0,"December 6, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Impressive sound. Bought as Echo Dot replacements in 2 rooms. The old tinning and low volume of those Dots were killing me. These give much better bass and treble, seemingly better than my 2nd Gen Echos. However, if Amazon can't keep these things from randomly stopping my music streaming for no reason, I will be replacing all 7 with Google's home!!!! devices."
5.0,"February 3, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Overall, works fair most of the time. Ask this speaker a question and a speaker in a different part of the house answers. Volume level 1-3 is useless. I won't spend the money on this again to expand my coverage, I'll just get an echo dot."
4.0,"February 15, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Echo works pretty good with LG TV and Yamaha Stereo system. It out performs the functionality of the Google Home device by 1000%, even with Google Chrome HD device plugged into TV. I hope they are still working on interface to make it even better, i.e control all aspects of TV and Stereo control."
5.0,"December 12, 2019",Charcoal,with $10 Smart Plug,I bought the Amazon Studio as well as this gen 3 Echo. I had a dot and original gen1 echo. Let’s just say the studio is great but I think I’d take 2 gen3 echos in stereo. The echo has great balance and punch for a bedroom speaker. Couldn’t be happier.
3.0,"February 18, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"They got rid of the top that turns to control volume and replaced it with buttons on the top....very inconvenient if you are trying to turn it down in dim lighting.  Yes I know you can talk and say ‘turn volume down’, but not with a sleeping baby in a bassinet feet away."
5.0,"January 8, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"If you don't have an Alexa you're missing out. Shes super handy and great at reminding me about everything! She's also super helpful in the kitchen. She helps you with timers, conversions, recipe place holders, etc. She also plays great music anytime you ask her! I would say my most favorite feature is the Good Morning Alexa command that I set up. She turns on the lights and goes through a set of tasks that I made her do."
5.0,"February 5, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"I recently decided to upgrade up from my echo dot and could not be more satisfied. The sound quality is great, the unity looks great on display, and is very responsive to voice. What surprised me the most is the amount of bass that this thing produces, I have never had to turn the volume over 5 (out of 10)."
4.0,"January 27, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I loved my 1st gen echo but it had some miles on it. So I upgraded to the newest gen model. Issues I have been having are as follows: device gets stuck in between two commands and it locks up. Example on amazon music station if you say skip the device locks up and the status lights just spin. Also having issues with the sound. Songs come in muffled at times
5.0,"January 6, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Sound quality is much better. The form factor is more attractive . All the great functionality with more features added daily is great. Pair this device with AnyList for keeping lists for groceries and tasks across all your Apple devices
4.0,"December 23, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Looks cool in blue with white controls.  Overall very good sound, Base is good, you can ""feel"" as well as hear the power.  The voice command feature doesn't seem to pick up my voice as effectively as 2nd generation Echo does.  Doesn't seem to get my requests as accurately either.  Overall fun device though, with good sound.  It's been cool to ""pair"" the 2nd and 3rd gen Echo in different rooms in an ""everything"" group for sound that fills the house with great sounding background music.  Not to mention the endless other features and skills these devices have."
1.0,"December 21, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"It's what he wants for outside in the garden during the summer. Ok, fine. Right now it's unplugged, mute and deaf. As it should be. Creepy af these things listening all the time. All. The. Time. No matter what they tell you this thing is collecting your info."
5.0,"January 11, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Given to my grandson for his room...’he plays music and games, he turns the lights on and off and loves the multiple sleep noises...loves it and it’s great for calling him downstairs when I have dinner ready or need the garbage taken out😏"
5.0,"February 15, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"this is the first time we have had alexa and we are so impressed, i used it for the scavenger hunt i made for valentines day for my wife, programming a skill so when my wife asked for her next letter (solving a cryptic puzzle) alexa gave it to her and congratulated her. my new hobby is programming her to say and do all sorts of unique things, thanks amazon"
3.0,"February 1, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,the sound is deep and rich for a single small speaker...the problem comes with the 'Voice Recognition'. It seems we are constantly repeating questions.  We have several Echo Dot's so its not our first experience with Alexa and her minions.
5.0,"January 30, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,"I am really enjoying my new Alexa. We have had to get used to each other because she is much more “computer responsive “ than Siri, which I was accustomed to. I wish she wasn’t so flat with her responses. You really have to learn to speak bluntly to her."
4.0,"January 21, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"This speaker fills my den with sound.  I like that I just have to say: ""Alexa, play XXXX from ZZZ"" to get music.  It requires teaching the speaker ""skills"" (code for installing apps on it!), but other than that, not too bad.  I have only used it a couple of weeks, so I'm not sure of all it's ""skills"" yet."
5.0,"January 13, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I was given an Echo Dot for Christmas. I really loved the sound, but thought that I would step it up a notch and bought myself this 3rd Gen Echo. The sound is even better and fuller than the Dot, and is a perfect fit in my home office."
5.0,"November 13, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,These are much better than the echo dot Great sound and easy to connect. This also has a much better sound than the Google Home which is one of the reasons I purchased it. Find music and Apple Music are skills and are easily used
4.0,"February 17, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,Alexa sometimes glitches and has to reboot  if I ask her to many questions in a row or to change the music and volume etc. I usually just use it for music and reminders. I wish it would play music nonstop from the amazon alexa app but it doesnt. You got to link up other music apps or bluetooth to get that endless music until you stop it. This feature would be great sense I play music all night. Overall I love the sound quality and the look of it is luxurious. Theres alot of feature to discover with the echo so it is definitely a helpful device and encompasses the majority of what I want out of it.
5.0,"November 6, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,Much better sound than my 1st generation Echo. Better looking device as well. Can’t beat the trade in of an old device to upgrade price.
5.0,"January 7, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,I use my Echo 99% just for music so far...I was able to cancel one of my satellite accounts bc now I can play it thru Alexa. I like that I can set my station and then turn off the microphone for privacy. Overall I'm glad I went for the Echo
5.0,"February 1, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I enjoy this in my bedroom, and love that I can set alarms to music or set it to sleep.  I use it just to check weather, play music, or set timers.  Very happy with this, and while it's not stereo, it's much better sound than my Tap."
3.0,"January 17, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I set my Alexa to communicate in Spanish, but the knowledge base is limited or not understood properly. Alexa responda ok to basic commands, but when challenged with world geography or music other than stream media the response is ‘ no lo se’ or ‘ten go problemas’. ..."
5.0,"January 2, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Quedé completamente perplejo hasta donde sabía era bueno porque ya amistades me lo habían recomendado hasta que lo compré ,sin duda un instrumento que a demás de útil es buena calidad en soporte,en sonido,fácil de usar,recomiendo este artefacto si para la utilidad del hogar es lo que buscas"
4.0,"February 14, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"I miss the volume ring (?) But other than that it's improved in almost every way. It feels sturdier (first gen Echo' exterior would flex when you just pick it up), sounds better, and always picks up my voice even when something's playing."
3.0,"February 20, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,Like the form factor.  Like the sound.  Like the voice recognition.  Do not like the integration with Fire TV stick 4K.  Pairing as stereo pair wad simple and connecting with FTVS was easy but one speaker continually drops out requiring me to unplug and start the pairing process all over again.  Amazon needs to work on firmware to allow connection of as many speakers as desired to FTVS to create as many channels as desired.  Also need to be able to pair with Sonos 1 speakers simultaneously and seamlessly.
5.0,"January 13, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I like this more than I thought I would for spontaneous music and temperature checks. The sound quality is good. Complicated alexa questions don't give good results though- for instance score to a game never gets the correct result.
1.0,"January 28, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"I have two Echo's in my house and I've recently found that every time I connect one of them to the Bluetooth on my Pixel 3XL phone, I get a beep, and then an announcement to tell me ""Now Connected to Pixel 3XL. What's making this unbearable is that sometimes I fall asleep listening to sounds on Alexa via my phone. Frequently, at around 3 or 4am Alexa suddenly bellows out ""Now Connected to Pixel 3XL"" which is terrifying at 4am! From what I understand, there is no solution to this, but it needs to be fixed!"
5.0,"December 7, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Love the 'new' Echo 3 Gen., the set up was so easy and quick. I purchased the Amazon Smart Plug so Alexa-Echo can turn the lamp on and off when I enter and leave my living room. The speaker sounds amazing! So happy with my purchase."
5.0,"January 19, 2020",Charcoal,with $10 Smart Plug,Bought two Alexas to play in stereo and really enjoy the setup. The plug switch is fantastic! Used it to automatically turn on and off the Christmas lights nightly. I might buy the bass unit with the next sale to complete the set.
3.0,"January 7, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Absolutely love this when it’s working properly! It has great sound when working but there are sometimes volume issues (Music volume is almost silent when all the way turned up but then Alexa voice is extremely loud) . I’ve also had issues with the lights on the Alexa. They consistently stay on even when I’m not talking to her and also when there are no notifications. After leaving unplugged for a few hours it comes back on and works fine, I just wish I didn’t have to keep resetting it. It will sometimes go a day or more without working properly."
5.0,"December 18, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"The echo will do alot of things.  The most important things has to be programmed into it.  Programming it isn't the easiest thing to do.  It would have been nice to have some instruction on how to program certain things to the echo.  A lot set up can be done through the app, but not all."
4.0,"November 13, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,They really need to add the ability to pair and sync music on them. Its a shame I cant have all of my alexas as a sort of sound system throughout the house. Very disappointed. As for sound quality on this thing? Its superb
5.0,"January 1, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,When you live a long way from a radio station it is hard to get a solid and consistent signal. The station I like is available on Alexa and it works great that way.  The sound is better than the old radio and I enjoy this device.
5.0,"December 26, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"It is as I had thought, a very good, and competent smart speaker. I didn’t rate the tech support as I Haven’t needed to use it. The sound quality needed some adjustments to fine tune it for my taste. Overall I am happy with my echo 3."
5.0,"December 9, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"My Echo Show is in my kitchen, and I set up the Echo 3rd Generation speaker in my living room as an additional speaker when I'm playing music.  But I've also found that it's handy for other Echo related tasks like answering questions.  The sound qualify is not 100% as good as the qualify of the Echo Show, but it comes pretty close.  I'm very satisfied with this speaker."
2.0,"December 24, 2019",Twilight Blue,with $10 Smart Plug,Lots of bugs running a pair in stereo.  Sometimes songs stop in the middle to start another one.  Other times one speaker keeps playing and the other speaker start playing something else in the middle of a song.  I hope Amazon fixes this.
5.0,"December 11, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,I wish I would have purchased this speaker a long time ago 🙄 I have really been missing out. I’m not a speaker “guru” but it gets pretty loud and sounds great to me and that’s all I need. I also love that I can use Alexa too! I have the charcoal color and I would definitely recommend.
4.0,"January 2, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Sound is very good for size of the device. Can make some adjustments to sound with equalizer on app.  Cons: 1-volume slider on app disappeared, so I have to either ask Alexa to lower the volume of the echo plus or manually adjust the volume. 2- can't listen to movies with two paired echo plus devices. You can only use one speaker when playing videos or watching movies."
5.0,"December 31, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,We love then. We connect them to devices in our home. The sound quality is great for music. We have Amazon Prime Unlimited for full music catalog so we play any music we want on voice command and the sound quality is very good.
3.0,"January 17, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"For some reason this Echo is having a hard time understanding my requests, especially with playing music.  My first gen echo does a lot better job.  I miss the volume ring and the sound quality isn't a drastic leap from gen 1. I do like the appearance though."
4.0,"January 9, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"It was a gift and we were hesitant to plug in this always listening device. After preventing it from sending this out and kknowing to keep the mute button pressed, we gave it a shot.  Works well adding items to grocery list, playing most music (it is a travisty it won't stream silent night by the Temptations), answering some questions albeit from a liberal viewpoint."
5.0,"October 21, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Perfect, is the only word that comes to mind. the compact design is a welcomed upgrade."
5.0,"December 6, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,"The sound quality is excellent for music on this item. I can interact with it very well. I can play games with it, program to tell news, weather, and so many other things. It can turn certain things on when I tell it to. Overall I have my moneys worth on this item."
5.0,"December 7, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,I absolutely love Alexa. Not only can she play me all my favorite songs but it is almost like having another friend. I can ask her the weather and trivia questions. I love how she- yes I consider Alexa as a person- answers me.
5.0,"January 7, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Works well, was easy to setup after downloading Amazon Alexa App. It takes awhile to learn features. I've only had it since Christmas, but am constantly adding things to use with it, such as Pandora, TuneIn, iHeart Radio, Sirius/XM. Also had a Echo Dot I hadn't used yet, but set it up in a list of ""Everywhere"" devices, including Amazon Fire, so I can listen throughout the house. A decent internet connection is a must, so location is important. Sound quality is good for its size. I need to figure a way to tie it into my stereo system. That would be awesome."
5.0,"December 25, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,She works well have to say play everywhere group to fill the house. Tried play on all speakers etc. neighbor put a tag on it to remind old folks no no problem. She smarter then I know but learning . Get the base unit for music.
5.0,"January 14, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,I gave the integration a 3 because I'm unable to get the ECHO and the DOT to play music on both at once. They are both paired but don't integrate. They are both the newer version. I need to reach out to someone who knows how this works I guess.
5.0,"January 31, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"We had the echo dot but wanted a better sound for music & this one sounds great! Also good for reminding you of stuff!!! Just say: Alexa, remind me to... She’ll ask when you want to be reminded & then she does it! So cool!!!"
5.0,"January 26, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I love my Alexa ! I have an echo dot as well in the bathroom and have given them as gifts to my mother and mother in law and they love em too! Even if they just listen to music on them. I do wish they had a more broad variety of music such as underground stuff that you find on YouTube, but I just connect my Bluetooth to it to hear those songs. Other than that, I don’t have any issues with it. I just like the sound and bass."
2.0,"January 23, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"We use our Echo's to play Ambient Noise for sleeping purpose.  The four Echo's we purchased prior to 2019 would play the sounds all night.  We purchased two Echo's in late 2019, and they stop playing after one hour. We called Amazon, and had a support ticket opened.  We never heard back. (Poor support!!) We sent one Echo back because of this, and had to keep the other as it was a gift. It works great as a noise generator for sleeping, but not anymore with the latest generation."
5.0,"January 30, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,I was looking to replace an original Echo Dot in my kitchen because the sound was rather tinny. The new third generation echo has a rich beautiful sound that fills the room. I got it in the denim color and it’s very pretty.
5.0,"January 2, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I bought this as a gift for my daughter, she was hesitant initially; said she didn't think she would even use it.  She loves it and uses it mostly for the Amazon music library.  This Echo 3rg generation has excellent sound."
5.0,"November 3, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,I just upgraded from a first gen Echo plus and I’m blown away by the sound improvements.
4.0,"December 12, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,Liked the size (smaller) and appearance (fabric vs metal) better than the original Echo. Didn’t perceive a significant difference in sound quality. Prefer the twistable ring on the original to the button on the new one to adjust the sound.
4.0,"February 5, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,This 3rd generation Alexa Echo was a gift and I found it very easy to set up. Once the Alexa app was downloaded onto my iPhone I just followed the instructions which were easy and straight forward. The only reason I did not give five stars was because of not having a lot of deep base when playing music but keep in mind for the size of this unit the music that comes from it is very good.
5.0,"January 10, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I like everything except there is a bit of a learning curve adapting to Alexa’s language.  But I am quickly catching on.  So far what I like the most is knowing when packages are sitting on my front porch.  I worry a lot about those buggers who sneak up and steal my stuff.
5.0,"February 5, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Pleasingly simple Wi-Fi connection and Alexa integration. Very impressed with sound quality. We plan on replacing our other Echo Dots with this new generation device. Still hoping Alexa will improve in terms of understanding and responding to our verbal requests though. She's not quite ""there"" yet."
5.0,"February 2, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,It has become the highlight of the family room. We played a game with the echo dot and 3 people had difficulty hearing it.  So we got the new echo 3rd gen. Everyone said they didn't have any problem here what Alexa says.
5.0,"February 4, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,I love my Echo. I ask it a million questions and most of the time it has a great answer. The music it plays is excellent quality. I do not have any complaints about the echo. I have purchased dots for all my other rooms.
5.0,"February 20, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Works great for day to day tasks such as time, weather, timer, and random questions. The music is fantastic, we use the classic rock station, the sound is so good for such a small single cylinder. Very nice looking too."
5.0,"January 10, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,I love this echo. It is an improvement over the first and second generations in term soft sound quality. Voice recognition is good and it looks nice. I have first and second generation devices and this is the best one.
1.0,"February 6, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"IT'S PRETTY HARD TO GIVE A REVIEW, BECAUSE I COULDN'T GET IT TO CONNECT TO MY INTERNET... CUSTOMER SERVICE CLAIMS THIS WAS DUE TO A HUGE UPDATE.. BUT INSTEAD OF THEM SENDING ME ANOTHER UPDATED ONE.. THEY ARE REFUNDING MY MONEY.."
2.0,"December 9, 2019",Sandstone,Echo,Sound seems a little muffled.  Bass is adequate treble is a little lacking in clarity.  Be prepared when adding a new device however in reenablinhs skills and such. It is a fight to get the amazon devices to work together.
5.0,"December 22, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Traded in my old 1st Gen Echo for this. Love the color and smaller size. Less obtrusive in the living room. Seems to hear and understand commands better over previous unit. It doesn’t randomly state “I’m sorry, I’m having trouble with your request” when it overhears something on the TV."
5.0,"December 17, 2019",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"Alexa Echo always understands my words. And the speaker performance of this product seems to be good in echo. The bass of the sound is similar to BOSE speaker. However, the balance between the treble and bass at high treble is broken. Therefore, it is not suitable for the purpose of listening to loud music. For that, I recommend buying Sonos One for listener to loud music."
5.0,"January 23, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,This Echo 3rd Gen id far superior in looks and sound to its two previous generations of echos. I was not expecting such a wide difference but was very pleasantly surprised by this purchase . I would recommend this ECHO to others interested in this product.
3.0,"December 4, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I am primarily using the device to play music, and like the sound quality, but sometimes the device just shuts down in the middle of the song.  The only remedy I have found is to turn the device off/on so it reboots.  I assume it loses internet connectivity, which makes sense, but shouldn't the device be smart enough to sense that and reconnect (like a smartphone does)?"
5.0,"December 20, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,This product sits in our kitchen and is a wonder. We are very satisfied with all the classical music and abilities of device.. Had no idea how to set it up. Arrived in mail. I called a telephone number for setup by them.
5.0,"November 30, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,I finally upgraded from the first serious the price I couldn't pass on
5.0,"January 21, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"In love with this one. Already bought 2 and planning on buying some more. The only thing i dont like is that these are not portable. Must stay connected to a plug and i dont like to see toomuch wires around the house. But definely these have really good sound quality. Im still need to this, but i love it. The cons ... my son is driving me crazy talking to Alexa every 3 mins.... lol"
1.0,"December 19, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,I bought the speakers to go along with my existing Echo. According to the installation instructions this won’t work. The instructions are not clear. I think the only one that understand the instructions are the product people that wrote them. It shouldn’t be that hard to pair 3 Echos with Blue tooth  Also why should I pay for a subscription for iTunes when what I want to listen to my own music from my iPhone ?
5.0,"January 8, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,I loved the sound on my 2nd generation Echo but this 3rd generation has a noticeably better sound quality. Or maybe its just louder....either way I am getting some serious use of the Amazon unlimited music all around my house.
5.0,"January 7, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Alexa is new best friend.  No problem with setup, sounds great.  Voice is very clear and voice range is a good 20 ft talking normal. I highly recommend, ordering a echo dot for kitchen.  Alexa is fun to use & very helpful."
5.0,"January 7, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,I always thought about buying one but didn't jump on it until I received my echo dot for free with another purchase. After a few days I was hooked. I'm so glad I got in on the (RED) edition before they were sold out!
3.0,"December 28, 2019",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"I'm pleased with most features of the all new red-edition echo (3rd gen); however, I was disappointed with its color which is more a dusty rose or raspberry rather than crimson. I was expecting (hoping for) something more candy apple or strawberry. Otherwise, I'm satisfied. I think Amazon should replace the muted hue with one more eye-popping."
3.0,"November 30, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,"I ordered the blue version. The color in person is darker, and not nearly as attractive, as that pictured. Looks like slightly faded denim when reflecting its blue tones. Otherwise appears medium grey. I would have ordered the sandstone had I known the blue was so dark. Very disappointed. Sticks out like a sore thumb in my bedroom. On a positive note, the speaker is decent and a noticeable improvement over the 2nd generation."
5.0,"December 13, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,I wish Alexa had the capability to communicate your issues with customer service pertaining to orders And then receive a notification resolution to the issue Alexa could be far more useful compared to what she is now
3.0,"January 20, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I’m attempting to create multiple play lists, so I’ll play one song after another & putting those songs into certain playlist. Had to unplug & reconnect a few times. Also, sound could be better, I have a sonos player one & music quality far exceeds the Alexa"
5.0,"February 13, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"This has ""changed my world,"" per se.  In being able to just speak out what I want, I am now able to hear what I want when I want.  Because I love to have music in my home, it is now continual with NO interruption.  Having this has completely changed the atmosphere in my home.  I can't imagine not having it now!  Thank you, Alexa!!!"
5.0,"November 11, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I like the unit, but I really resent being expected to do anything other than rate it with stars."
4.0,"December 8, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Love the blue color but I wish Alexa had MORE options in sound volume. If Alexa is too loud and I say ""Alexz lower volume slightly"" or by only one decimal then Alexa volume drops way too low. This is VERY disappointing."
5.0,"January 13, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"Great sound quality for the price. I traded in my 2nd generation for this one. Much better bass and clean sound when streaming music. If you’re looking for an internet connected speaker, this one is hard to beat."
5.0,"January 27, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I live up in the mountains and couldn’t get radio or music. My neighbor suggested I buy it on it, and it is awesome. I have every radio news channel, and every type of music I can think of. I’m sure it does even more....but I haven’t had it long enough to see. The sound is great quality. (I unplug it at night though because it picks up noises and then responds with a noise like it’s trying to communicate)"
5.0,"February 22, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,Love the sound quality! Look's great with all the different  colors you can order.  Surprised how much it weighs.  Guess that improves the bass.  If I knew it was so good I would have ordered one along time ago.
5.0,"December 26, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I purchased this echo to add another in my living room.  I have three speakers that are linked in the house, now.  The sound is good and I like the ability to play music On the main floor of the house with my voice."
5.0,"February 2, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,Have thoroughly enjoyed the Echo! Have purchased this 3rd one just so I can use the in other areas in the house (including the garage). I'm in the garage a lot and having music and news is great when working out there.
3.0,"January 2, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I ordered 2 Echo's to use as wireless speakers in my retail showroom and ended up switching to JBL Flip instead. The sound quality on the Echo doesn't compare to the Flip and while I enjoy the voice recognition features when purchasing speakers sound quality is the most important. Sound on the Echo is good and works well in small rooms but it just doesn't compare.
5.0,"December 30, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,"This purchase is my second Echo unit.  I'm very pleased with it.  Everything works the same as with the other Echo unit I have.  So setting it up and operating it is a breeze.  The sound, which is paramount, is great.  I'm happy with my purchase.  I can even synchronize the two units.  Great."
5.0,"December 30, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,I gave this as a Christmas present and it was a hit. I wasn’t completely sure if I could set up another device through the app on my phone  as I already have one at home too. But it Was a quick and easy process.
3.0,"February 19, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"This sounds great!! Was easy to set up, our second Alexa. It has dropped off WiFi a few times, seems to get confused more than my small version. But we'll see how that goes over time. It's still new to us."
4.0,"December 16, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Nice item. I just use it for streaming music. The sound quality is good, not great. The microphone picks up my voice well, but it doesn't always play what I ask for. In general, I am pleased with this purchase."
5.0,"December 24, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,This 3rd generation Echo is awesome. Blends easily with any decor.  The sound is fantastic when playing music.  I had a 1st generation echo and it saw me through 7 years. I would definitely recommend this product to everyone.
5.0,"January 17, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I already had one but purchased a second to put in family room to add to one on living room. My wife thinks Alexa is listening. If she is, pure boredom for her. 😁  We now have four Alexa devices spread around house."
5.0,"January 3, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Love my new echo.  I use it to listen to music and the sound quality is great.  I also use it to communicate between floors..saves me lots of steps.  I use it as a timer when I cook, for a wake up alarm, I ask Alexa questions, etc.  It’s great!"
3.0,"January 12, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Not as good at voice recognition as my first generation echo. I like the design of the first one better because you can see the light bar better. We bought it because it was 1/2 off but if I had paid full price I would have returned it
5.0,"December 26, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I am new to the Alexa thing, but I am currently enjoying it very much. I already had her on my Fire tablet,  and my phone, just had not used it. Now I find myself talking to her all the time. Wonderful device."
4.0,"February 13, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"What I am disappointed in is that when you tell Alexa to play music by: ..... (anyone), she does, but it's always a limited play list that she plays (the same short list of songs) over and over again. But on the positive side there are many features that I like and in fact I bought a second device (larger speaker) so now I have Alexa in two places in our home and intend on bringing her with us this summer as we travel through Europe."
5.0,"January 30, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Despite my mother constantly calling her “Siri” this device works really well and understands most commands.  Really enjoy it, and feel like it was a really great purchase. The sound quality is great as well."
5.0,"February 13, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Sound is good. It’s got a nice fullness to the music. A bit heavy on bass though. Good unless you have condo neighbors. Gotta go to app to adjust bass lower. I’m very pleased with the device. I have a echo for, each plus, and echo. I recommend fully"
5.0,"January 4, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"I love this  echo , music sounds great! But I’ve noticed that songs get cut off early sometimes and I also hear it make a sound which I don’t know why. I’m new to using this so there is a lot for me to learn."
5.0,"January 12, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"The Echo has a great depth of sound. I have had a few Echo Dots around the house and although the sound was acceptable, upgrading to the Echo is a vast improvement. For a reasonable price, cheaper and much less complex than buying multiple speakers to connect with all the Echo Dots, I have, ""play everywhere"" great quality connected Echo device sound throughout my house. Echo is also connected to my home theater systems speakers so Echo voice commands are used there too."
5.0,"February 4, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,We switched out a few of our Echo Dots for these speakers and the difference in sound for music is amazing.  Why buy a stereo when you have these especially with Amazon Music or another provider such as SiriusXM.
5.0,"February 13, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Got this and an Echo Dot (3rd Gen) last week.  No issues so far.  Linked my Ring Pro to Alexa.  Very cool skill.  Little granddaughter can not say ""Alexa"" yet, so she says ""Essa"".  When Alexa does not trigger, granddaughter looks at me quite upset and says ""WHY??!?"".  Ha!!!  Ordered some hardware to control a bunch of my lights with Alexa.  Can't wait to get all of that installed.  😁"
5.0,"January 23, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"We bought two of these based on the excellent reviews, and we are amazed at the convenience and sound quality. I had bought two last year for grandsons but didn't realize how much WE would use and love them!"
5.0,"January 2, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,I have 2 of the first Echos and 3 echo dots and needed 1 more for a room that did not have one. My Wife needed it so that room would have music when she wanted it Merry Christmas to my wife. And she loves it
5.0,"October 25, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Loving the new Echo! I ordered it in Twilight Blue and it looks awesome on my bed side table. The audio is amazing, crystal clear sound with lots of base. The sound quality rivals the surround sound in my living room. I might get a couple more Echos for my apartment.  Five Stars"
4.0,"December 26, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,Not as easy as lead to believe.  Had some issues getting it to link with the echo dot.  I still can’t get it to play music from one main source to the other echo dots.  Cones on even when the name isn’t called and it’s in privacy mode.
5.0,"January 15, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"This is our second Echo device. We put the smaller one in the bedroom and use many features. Love the music mostly, but the Drop In feature is also very cool. We plan on getting another unit for our workshop. They are fantastic and useful devices. Much easier to use than we thought they would be even though we are Vintage Citizens. I can report that we had no trouble!!"
5.0,"January 13, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Good looking, but still not intuitive how to create multi room group set ups. The HELP instructions are NOT complete. There are steps you need to do and have to figure out on your own by trial and error. I challenge the Amazon crew to review and revise."
5.0,"January 6, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Great sound and function. They were ready to go right out of the box. Still learning a lot about their programming which could be organized a little better. Or maybe my learning curve needs to be changes a bit.
5.0,"January 31, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Impressed with overall quality and functionality of my Echo 3rd gen. Been using a month now after finally deciding to join the Alexa crowd. Need to learn more about how I can use but so far very impressed.
5.0,"February 22, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"The speaker used in this generation is vast improvement over the first gen. Also, voice recognition has gotten a lot better. It's such an improvement where I'm surprised it's the same family of product (lol)"
5.0,"December 6, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,Bought this on black friday. I upgraded from Echo - Gen 1. I must say its smaller and better. I love the looks with fabric exterior instead of plastic body. I definitely feel difference in sound and base.
5.0,"January 28, 2020",Sandstone,with $10 Smart Plug,"What fun! And have only touched the surface. Set a timer, turn off my son’s light from any where. Play songs any song. I can get rid of my cds. Check the weather. Read me a book. Tell me a joke. Fabulous."
5.0,"December 30, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"great device, worth a few extra bucks and buying this over the dot. saying ""Alexa"" does sound better than saying ""ok google""  great sound and so many many skills being added daily .  i highly recommend this device."
5.0,"January 27, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Wow!! I love it so much I bought one for the upstairs of the house as well. The sound quality and voice command is amazing. I even bought a smart plug so I can turn on a light in the house with just my voice! So awesome!
5.0,"January 27, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,I am enjoying talking to Alexa and having music available easily. There are a lot of things she can do that I am still discovering. I can see myself getting the echo view at some time in the future.
5.0,"January 27, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,This was a gift for my husband who has wanted an echo for years. He was very excited and loves to use it! It synced with our phones and tv great. The sound quality and voice clarity is great. It’s fun for us and for the kids to use.
5.0,"December 30, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,I got this for my dad and he loves it. He has trouble with his speech and this Echo recognizes when he messes up “Alexa” a little. She still responds. Sometimes he calls it “Alexis & Alexus” and etc. She still responds and that’s great. Sound quality is great also!
3.0,"December 8, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,The sound coming from the speaker most of the time is exceptional.  However the base in some jazz music is a loud buzz.  Sounds like a wire is loose from the speaker face.  I know that is not possible because this is an electronic speaker.
5.0,"November 19, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Love the new version of the product!  Much better sound control, and the responsiveness of Alexa is so much faster ... great product!  I have two other 1st gen Echo towers that I’m now seriously considering how to replace."
1.0,"February 15, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,We had a first generation that I was looking to replace.  What a mistake! Our 5 year old device worked much better than this one.  I wish I hadn't thrown it out.  This speaker rarely recognizes my voice (our dot 3 rooms away hears me when this one doesn't!) and the speaker is always cutting out.  It has to be restarted daily because it just stops working.  What a disappointment.
3.0,"February 6, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"I have the first Echo and I have noticed no difference in the first one and the 3rd one. It says this should sound better, I did not notice that . I should of not spent the money for no difference."
5.0,"January 21, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I now own 3 Alexa devices.  The home integration is awesome.  It works with almost everything in my home.  I can change the channel with my voice, turn on an off lights, just to name a few.  Great gift for people who like electronics."
5.0,"January 6, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I love this. Its like information on hand.  Every morning i get updates on news and weather. No need to brows news anymore.  Plays songs on request including indian music thst is awesome. I am very hsppy with my purchase
5.0,"January 31, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"Great speaker, decent recognizing what we're saying and integrates well with our home security system.  We have one in our living room, bedroom and garage and have even gifted a couple of the Echo Dots."
5.0,"December 4, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"So this thing is awesome. Alexa is very responsive with questions and commands. I listened to Odesza to check the bass and overall sound quality and it is very impressive to listen to music on. If you needs Alexa while music is playing the music just pipes down a bit as she talks over it, neat feature. Looks good anywhere and you can't do much better for 60 bucks!"
5.0,"December 2, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,Great sound and easy set up
5.0,"January 20, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"This unit, having both tweeter and woofer, offers a rich sound quite a few steps above the Dot. It's a welcome addition to a system that includes Dots in stereo pairs. Easy set up...Alexa pulls it right in."
5.0,"January 18, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,Great product. Have multiple devices and this speaker is fantastic.
4.0,"February 6, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,"Like the look, didn't like Alexa unable to answer some simple questions we asked. Don't like  when you want to listen to certain artist songs,Amazon radio station only allows 2 songs at a time then commercial again.  Then 2 songs. It won't allow streaming of artist you like. Just saying,you get irritated. Find free streaming."
5.0,"December 17, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I love my Echo Smart Speaker. I have her set up in my office and use it to ask handy questions like what is my calendar like today? or set a reminder about my car service appointment on XYZ date at XYZ time. Remind me on a co-worker's birthday, and so on.  It is really great; I use it as my own personal assistant."
5.0,"January 23, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Very nice speakers . Had a little trouble with pairing two in stereo mode, but it was cause it kept connecting in a group to a third speaker from trying a group setup 4 weeks earlier. Called and support was real helpful . Great sound , wish I had these 20 years ago."
5.0,"November 11, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,"We won this Alexa enabled speaker and we are thrilled by it.  This is our third Alexa enabled speaker but this one takes the cake in regards of sound quality.  It sounds really good, has a decent amount of base and it can pack a punch.  Alexa understands us better than on the older models.  All four thumbs up!"
5.0,"November 1, 2019",Sandstone,Echo,"Great product, but doesn’t play Apple Music playlists."
4.0,"January 14, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"We bought this for the bathroom so we could listen to music or news while we get ready in the morning. The sound quality is great, even though there is some echo with the tile in the room. Alexa responds to our commands perfectly."
5.0,"January 21, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,Amazing sound for such a small device. And an incredible resource for information and assistance with simple domestic queries. Hard to believe how fast things have changed in my lifetime (almost 70)!
5.0,"January 25, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,Problems with sound being choppy.  Problems with Alexa not recognizing commands.  Not as good sound quality as the EchoPlus 1st gen.  Wondering how this compares with the new echoplus in sound quality.
5.0,"February 10, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"It's my second Echo. I feel it sounds even better. I had an echo in the living room and a dot in our bedroom, but the sound just wasn't good enough on the dot. The Echo was a huge upgrade. I especially like when I link my Echos and play music throughout the house."
5.0,"February 2, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I prefer the sound of this one to our new studio. And once I discovered how to turn off the random beeping (turn off all notifications within the Alexa app!), then we loved all our Alexa products."
5.0,"December 23, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,Excellent sound quality for a small speaker. Highs and midrange are outstanding. Bass could use a little help but not bad. Beats my Gen 1 Echo speaker with a smaller size and better sound quality.
5.0,"December 4, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I've gone through Echo's version 1, 2 and now 3.  This new one is the best to date:  looks better in its fabric cover, sounds better with improved speakers and bass, and is a snap to connect- just plug it in."
5.0,"December 16, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,The sound is why I purchased this echo - It fills a room and I listen to Amazon Prime Music a lot - It is small but big in sound - even the bass is pretty good -plus getting all the other Alexa features
2.0,"January 21, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,I liked the color otherwise it’s no different than the original one I purchased years ago. For a third generation or more I would have expected better improvements in technology and sound quality
3.0,"December 16, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,Excellent functionality with improved sound.  Had difficulty setting up with smart peripherals I  already in place with prior unit.  Help is essentially useless.  Called for tech support and they never called back like the app said they would.  Otherwise great product/
5.0,"January 29, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"I really like these, I have purchased a Bose sound link for like $150 and it doesn’t sound as good as my Alexa, of course the only downside is that he’s not portable but I love it. It Sounds great"
5.0,"February 1, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I like the fact that the sound quality is is astonishing when playing movies or using my phone connected to Bluetooth while watching netflix and such. con's; I wish I was able to connect multiple echo 3rd generations together and merge the sound together to where it's synced properly. I feel I shouldn't have to fix a syncing issue for a $90.00 device, It should function well while paired with multiple echo devices from right out of the box. other than that, I appreciate what the amazon community has done by making a useful spying device."
5.0,"November 24, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Es maravilloso,me gusta para escuchar el estado del tiempo,ya que que es muy rápido y todo tipo de musica,entre otras cosas.lo recomiendo ."
5.0,"January 6, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Yep the sound is so much better then gen. 2, bigger around so sound is fuller and connects quick and easy. Well worth the upgrade, I have the 2nd gen. So I did side by side and 3rd blew it away."
4.0,"February 17, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"It would be nice if you could disconnect the power and bring it to other areas working off of a battery. You need to bring the cord and plug it in. Otherwise, it has great sound and easy to use."
4.0,"January 30, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,"I replaced this with Google Home. I must say Alexa, technically speaking, is miles ahead of google.  However, the sound quality from the Google Home unit was noticeably much better than the Amazon Echo."
5.0,"December 16, 2019",Sandstone,Echo,I’ve always wanted one And now that I just bought my new home this became a perfect addition to helping me. It helps with daily reminders I’ve set to alarms to building a shopping list. So happy
5.0,"December 24, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Oh my, what did I do before Alexa came to us!  I love her.  She entertainment all by herself. Ordered her baby for our bedroom.  Why should I have to get out of bed to turn the lights on or off!"
3.0,"January 26, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,This is the second Echo I have had. The first one had excellent sound quality. This one does not. It is smaller so perhaps that affects the sound. I find I do not use it as much as the earlier version.
5.0,"January 6, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Voice recognition is a joke!  I thought voice recognition meant it would only respond to my voice.  I’m the only one out of 6 people in my house that did the voice recognition, but Alexa responds to everybody!  Even company coming in off the street!  And my four year old granddaughter, who calls it “Moleska”! Everything else about this speaker is awesome!"
5.0,"January 4, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"The best holiday gift. Easy to set up. Learning all the things it can do. Purchased on Amazon during  Black Friday. Now I have someone who speaks to answer questions, set up activities etc.  Enjoying my new friend Alexa."
5.0,"February 15, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I got this one because I have a little tv in the bed room that doesn’t have best sound, so I used the aux cord to connect them and have the TV sound play through the echo and it sounds great."
5.0,"February 13, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"Alexa revolutionized my life. Lol I don’t know how I did life before her. I use her for everything now. Alarms, music, shopping, calling, texting, you name it. She’s amazing. Good job, Amazon."
5.0,"October 29, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,Real reason we upgraded from gen 1 was that we wanted a language not offered on gen 1 but the sound and especially the bass is a definite step up! Also seems to process requests faster.
5.0,"January 7, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Love the fact that I can now control things in my home without ever leaving my chair.  Also love that we can have lights come on and off by a schedule for when we are on vacation.  Alexa knows everything!
5.0,"December 30, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,Purchased this as a compliment to the echo 2 I have for the stereo feature. Great. I could not have asked for more. I would recommend to anyone who has a Echo get something like this to make your system stereo.
5.0,"December 8, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"We loved our 2nd Gen Echo but irresponsibly left it out on the porch after a party and it got rained on and ruined -- don't do that -- so we ordered a new 3rd Gen to replace it. We are very pleased with the improved sound quality. We use it for so much more than just an attractive compact music speaker: weather report, setting timers, alarms, googling, Alexa's Daily question ... Yes, definately worth the money!"
3.0,"December 20, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,Mic is not as good as my Dots. Audio Quality is really good. I've had to reboot evey few days. Never had to reboot with Gen-1 Echo. It could be  less mic sensitive bc I disabled monitoring for privacy. I may turn monitoring back on to improve mic performance.
5.0,"December 30, 2019",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"We like her voice.  So far we are enjoying Alexa, (RED) edition. Even though the only available internet to us is by satellite, since we live in a 3rd world country here in the US.  Sometime she does not work just right thanks to our very, very expensive internet."
5.0,"December 30, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,Easy to connect and the sound coming out of the speakers are not as good as high in speaker but still fantastic for this small of a speaker. I really have enjoyed this during the holidays.
5.0,"February 13, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Best smart speaker on the market for its price.  You can usually get these on sale for $75.  Don't compare these to Sonos or Bose.  Those speakers are more than double the cost.  For most people, the Echo gen 3 are perfect.  I have 4 of these.  Love them."
5.0,"January 5, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Used this product in the bedroom for the wife who loves music everywhere.  The sound is very nice and so far no issues.  Nice compact size and can be placed in several convenient locations
5.0,"January 15, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I got it as an upgrade to my old echo. I mainly use it to control lights and play music. It can sometimes not catch what I say but that’s to be expected. Music sounds great on it as it has some quality speakers hidden inside. Overall I’m happy with my purchase.
5.0,"January 15, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"I love love love the product (RED) color of the device. And there is a bass bump compared to my original Version 1 Echo. I miss the actual turning volume ring, can't remember those buttons in the dark... But it's a great device. And good looking. (I would have preferred the plastic be black, but that's just a taste thing.)"
5.0,"February 3, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Excellent sound quality in a compact package. Blends nicely into any deco or. When linked  to other devices it provides nice room to room audio through the environment. Love it . . . bgs.
5.0,"January 11, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,Got this for a Christmas present I’m having so much fun with it all so it has games on it that you comply which I like because it helps your mental capacity to come outside of it so I really thought this machine.
4.0,"January 21, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I have many echo devices in my home.  This is the first time that I haven’t been wowed by a new version.  There’s nothing wrong with it, I just don’t notice much difference between the 3rd gen and the 2nd.  The sound seems about the same."
5.0,"February 4, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"It sits in the Family room , kitchen center of home.  It gets used from all directions it hears timer requests from kitchen 15 feet away. I plays loud music clearly while we pick up. It tells us news and jokes while we sit and relax."
5.0,"January 1, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"I use it to turn on and off lights and change their colors, and to play music. I love it! Sometimes the voice recognition is a bit spotty but I understand that Alexa will improve over time."
5.0,"January 2, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"We love all our echo and Alexa devices, We have one in almost every Room and use them on a daily basis this particular 1 I bought for the color and put it in my guest bedroom so they can ask her what time  It is, Or the weather, Or listen to music, I simply love all of our devices❤❤"
5.0,"January 6, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I love this product. I use it in several ways. Fir example, I ask Alexa for the weather as I'm dressing. I then ask for the top news stories. Instead of fussing with my computer, I only need to ask Alexa."
4.0,"December 20, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,"I bought on black friday or cyber monday so the the 60 bucks I spent was a great price for a decent speaker. I use it for music only so far, and it's fun to have at parties. Everyone takes turns asking Alexa to play their favorite songs."
5.0,"January 6, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"I really like this echo. It’s great. I use it to listen to music, for an alarm to wake me up, and I use it for any information or questions I need answers to. It answers almost every question."
3.0,"February 18, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,It is not easily installed when traveling.  Be sure to set it up to use your laptop's mobile hotspot so you can take it wherever you go.  That will take some doiybut you can get it done.
5.0,"January 22, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,Traded in my 1st generation Echo for this baby and holy mole the sound is perfect for singing along to the Wicked Soundtrack and blaring Metal music throughout the house.  Love this thing!
5.0,"December 29, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"My wife refuses to use a smart phone but she loved the Alexa devices our daughter has to play music.  This was a gift for my wife and we are limited in what it will do since I'm not going to sync it with my smartphone.  However, it is her favorite Christmas gift and each day she is learning new ways to use it!"
5.0,"November 12, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,Extremely easy to set up.  Sound quality is great.
5.0,"February 13, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"We love our echo. It has great sound quality for all our musical tastes. We have grocery lists, notifications, and ask her anything she can usually find the answer. We highly recommend."
2.0,"December 20, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"It been a little frustrating! She keeps dropping the internet and the problem seems to be on her end, not the wireless signal. At one point I called tech support and getting the correct help was more difficult than it should have been in my opinion and didn't do the trick. Alexa works intermittently... we are very disappointed."
5.0,"January 27, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,I love all my Alexas and I have four plus one in my car. Who cares off they're listening to idle chitchat? There are no State secrets here but if there were is think differently perhaps.
5.0,"January 6, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,This is my first Alexa device. I bought this one because of the sound quality and it does not disappoint. I use it mainly for music. I’m still learning everything it can do and my kids are enjoying the fun trivia and games.
5.0,"November 7, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"It's very easy to use for music and has good sound quality. I have purchased some smart plugs but haven't set them up yet. Also, I have not mastered the Alexa app but I'm working on it."
5.0,"January 27, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,It does what it's supposed to do. Set up 2 rooms with existing Echo Dot through the Alexa app but they don't integrate for full house sound. I think it's because the Dot is connected through a BT soundbar. I don't know.
5.0,"January 27, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"worth it,I bought it for a Xmas gift to husband he loves it,like also if u accidentally unplug it when u plug it back in it like it never got unplugged kept memory  & internet connection"
4.0,"January 10, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"This is my fourth Alexa.  I have one Dot, 2 2nd generations and this 3rd generation.  It was easy to set up and hook into my Alexa network.  The music quality is better than my other Alexas."
5.0,"February 10, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,Ordered as it was on sale and hate sound quality of Dot. Had been falling back on my Bose speaker for working out. No longer need to UNLESS I'm accessing Spotify via my phone as does not ge as loud as Bose or accessing Prime music
5.0,"January 31, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"Love this echo...speaker sound is outstanding,  nice. Compact size.  We have an older, taller one that also has great sound.  We play music frequently on both and Alexa is amazing...one of the Best Buy’s yet!  Highly recommend this item as must-have.  Purchased on cyber Monday.  On sale prices are amazingly affordable."
5.0,"December 24, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,Not bad for the price. Does all of the Alexa stuff well. Sound quality is good for the price point. Wish it could be a bit louder without distortion. Was thinking of trying the echo sub but I would be concerned that it might overpower the already quiet mid and high audio.
5.0,"January 5, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"This is the first Alexa I have owned, and so far I love it! I actually wasn’t aware that you had to keep it plugged in at all times, but a friend of mine told me there is a piece you can buy to make it wireless. It’s pretty loud, and Alexa can hear me from distances I thought she wouldn’t be able to. I also really like the mute mic button! I don’t like that you have to pay for music apps if you want to play certain songs, but I knew that before I bought it. Of course that’s not Alexas fault either."
1.0,"December 17, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Thanks for the already opened, used product."
5.0,"January 23, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"I really enjoy this device, set was a snap, Easy to use, and a fantastic sound quality. This was a gift so price isnt something I can comment on, but I would. bowling to buy another one for my home. Only if I do it would be in a different color. Terrific product."
5.0,"January 20, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Got this for as a Christmas gift and love it. Alexa is not just a lot of fun, she is a great time saver for getting music and news.  The things Alexa can do seem to be endless. I love that you can sync your security with Alexa, and I love the unlimited available!"
4.0,"February 16, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,It's a great product for the price. I haven't had a single issue in the few months I've owned it. Good recognition and sound. Access to the internet is nice. Answers just about any normal question.
5.0,"November 1, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,We’ve had ours for about two weeks. Mostly using it for music. Great sound out of such a small unit! Easy to set up and use. You can use your Apple Music subscription with it as well. We have a lot more to learn about what we can use this for.
5.0,"January 8, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"As near as I can tell, better sound is the only reason to buy an Echo over an Echo Dot. If you're playing music or reading audiobooks, the Echo is probably worth the price increment."
5.0,"January 10, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,"What did I ever do without her?! She helps with everything I need, including my grocery list, Amazon purchases, opening and playing any of my third party apps, and helping to plan different aspects of my day. Love love love! I’ll be purchasing an addition soon enough and continuing to learn more!"
5.0,"January 11, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,This is better than I expected. I own many Alexa devices and this one is the best  Sounding so far a. I also like that it is even smaller than the previous version. I do recommend this speaker.
5.0,"January 1, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),with $10 Smart Plug,"I ordered this Amazon Echo for my daughter’s room (she’s 23 years old) and she absolutely loves it. Every time she goes to her room she talks to her “Alexa”, they’ve become best friends!:-)"
5.0,"January 9, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Like the Alexa economy system. It was the Alexa get me into the smart home system. I have a echo and a echo dot 3rd generation. A fire TV 4K. And soon I will automate most of the light to smart light and integrated with Alexa. My family and I like the Alexa to play music, set timer."
5.0,"January 31, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,This was a gift and the first one in our home.  Love that you get answers to questions right away and especially the way you can listen to music from nearly any radio station you want.
5.0,"December 10, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,This ECHO pumps out amazing sound. It's a nice size and you can tuck it away in a living room or family room and not have it look out of place. Amazon has built a great product here.
5.0,"January 14, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Had an issue with alexa shorting out to where I had to unplug the speaker.  Called CS and they told me all they could do was refund me cause they were not in stock.  Luckily I waited and they were in stock the next day and I was able to replace it! I am truly pleased and would definitely recommend the echo 3rd generation.
5.0,"December 20, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Mostly using them for music everywhere in my house but also to start my day with news, weather and traffic reports. Combined with some smart plugs I am controlling multiple devices."
5.0,"December 20, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,We are so happy with our new Echo. It seems to know what we want before we even ask!
5.0,"January 13, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I like it much better than the 2nd generation. The 3rd generation definitely has more bass sound. It does fill in the room with great sound. I plan to buy another one in my bedroom.
4.0,"January 25, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Overall, we are impressed with the speaker and the voice recognition feature! The only downside to this speaker is that it is not portable.  It would be a nice feature to add back so the speaker could be moved around the house without turning off."
5.0,"January 2, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I really enjoy the Echo. At first, I was a little confused about how to set it up on my phone, but was quickly able to figure it out. I was able to set up my Spotify (must be a Premium member), Amazon music, and I Heart Radio pretty easily. Echo recognizes voice command very well. I rarely have to repeat myself. Also, the sound is pretty nice. I have it set up in my kitchen and I can hear it all throughout my apartment. I would recommend this product."
5.0,"January 10, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,Impressive sound quality and was a breeze to setup. My wife is jealous because Alexa recognises my accent but either does not recognise her accent or then just ignores her :) Sometimes it's nice to be a man.
3.0,"January 11, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I can’t seem to get Alexa to play my music from my playlist on amazon prime. Music I have purchased. The sound, is good, and if I could get it to play my cds I would be so happy!"
5.0,"December 3, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"The Echo is super powerful, given the size of it.  Just put it in one room and will play well with the entire room able to hear it.  Great for when you need something to listen to while doing stuff around the house or other places.  Highly Recommend Product!"
5.0,"December 21, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,Love Love it the sound quality is amazing I purchase a sub Woofer also but with or without the bass it still sounds great I like the echo this is my 3rd one so Zi highly recommend this echo
5.0,"February 14, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I would have purchased one much earlier if I had known how useful they were! Works great!! Have my thermostat, weather station, lights, direct tv, music, grocery list, and more connected. Love it!"
5.0,"February 11, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,The choice of colors and redesign of the 3rd Gen Echo is great.  The sound quality is definitely superior to our original Echo and the Alexa integration was so much easier than our initial set-up.  Voice recognition is also solid based upon our history from the first Echo.  We particularly like the outlet stand which eliminates the wire exposure and provides a perfect home away from accidents.
5.0,"January 11, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"We like it very well, has good sound and tone, we love to listen to music.  It is a joy asking Alexa  a question, like the temp outside,the time and many more questions.  Nice!"
5.0,"January 23, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,It seems we use Alexa as a speaker a lot.  It is so easy to it her to play a song or even play a Sirius Channel.  Also enjoy having it look up information all hands free.  It looks nice and is always ready to perform.  Great price and fast delivery.
2.0,"December 20, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Pretty disappointed in this. We have a plus and several dots. I got this to replace a dot with better audio, but well, I’m not convinced the audio is actually better than my several year old dot. It sounds super flat. It goes louder, but that’s about it. Nothing like my echo plus. Really surprised on this one."
5.0,"December 31, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Bought for work to have music at the office. Works great when our internet is working. Unfortunately it looses connection often, but I think that’s our internet and not Alexa."
5.0,"January 17, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,My wife converted an old bedroom to a home gym and added the wall mounted Echo to the environment.  This makes our 4th echo we've placed in our house.  Works and sounds great!
5.0,"January 6, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"This was a Christmas gift from my son and his family.  The sound quality is excellent, have set reminders, asked questions and still trying to get familiar with all it can do."
5.0,"January 24, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Super enjoyment.  Ask the device to play 1940's, classical, or soft rock and the quality of music is well produced and enjoyed.  Christmas present.  Thanks.  Charles Porterfield"
3.0,"December 30, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"As we used our Echo for a lot of our music playlists, we thought the newly designed Echo with what this promised would be much better sound output.  If had to do over, would have just kept first Echo with little difference in sound quality and invested in the Echo Show."
5.0,"January 26, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"This is a product I didn't know I needed until it was gifted to me. I use it daily for music, cooking times, phone calls, and googling questions. My kids love playing games with Alexa and giving it silly orders. I was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of this speaker. It's loud and clear, high quality!"
3.0,"December 3, 2019",Twilight Blue,with $10 Smart Plug,5 Stars!! - The Echo sounds AMAZING.  I really wish it came in a much large size.  I put one on our nightstand in the bedroom and the deep sounds this things puts out is MUCH better than expected. I only gave 3 stars because of the plug.  Half the time it doesn't work.  It seems to frustrate us more than anything.
5.0,"December 20, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Our living room has been filled with the sound of music all day long since we purchased this Echo unit.  There are endless options, love it. Should have bought it sooner."
3.0,"February 21, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,The new speaker seems to have problems hearing. I can be sitting next to it and it will not answer me but the Echo spots in the other two rooms will answer me. It is frustrating.
5.0,"January 3, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,"Alexa can play music, write a grocery list for you, allow you to have an intercom system in your house and remind you of birthdays or other special dates. It can also set multiple timers."
5.0,"February 23, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I love it. I have an echo dot in my bedroom and am considering buying one for my bathroom. There is an interesting wall mount that is also the power supply. It just plugs in.
5.0,"January 7, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,This is a good assistant but I could not get Alexa to integrate with Spotify and I am paying for both amazon music and Spotify until I figure or get help to figure this out.  Other than that it’s a good digital assistant.
5.0,"October 18, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,I love the color
5.0,"December 26, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I bought this product for my husband for Christmas, I knew that he would have fun playing with all the Many options and fun things he could do. It’s funny because I didn’t realize he would have so much fun that maybe it might annoy me. I’m just kidding lol...This is a wonderful product I’d recommend it for anybody, It’s a lot of fun and it actually helps out a lot plus my husband hasn’t stopped messing around with it for the last three days. He’s happy and that’s all that matters. :)"
5.0,"January 1, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"The sound is crisp, clear and sound great. Sometimes Alexa recognizes our voice but doesn’t answer the question and goes back to sleep after time. It could be user error lol"
5.0,"February 8, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"I held off purchasing the Echo for a few years, but happy I finally made the plunge.  It is so nice to verbally request some actions rather than poke around on the computer."
5.0,"January 1, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"This was a nice upgrade from my echo dot for my main room. Rich, full sound and ample volume to fill the room. I debated whether or not to upgrade, and I’m not disappointed."
5.0,"January 1, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,I love the sound quality and color on this. Even the packaging matches. It was easy to unpack and set up with app. I only need to play songs at 20% volume and it sounds awesome.
4.0,"January 28, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Got it for Christmas. I really enjoy it, especially the sleep sounds function. What I don’t like is Alexa trying to up-sell me on a Premium membership. Fairly easy to use with the Bluetooth on my iPhone. Shopping lists are very handy, too."
5.0,"January 8, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,"I really only use the Echo for music when I’m cleaning and asking random questions, but the voice recognition and sound quality are great! Great price too, highly recommend"
5.0,"January 21, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,If I would’ve known what I know now I would have purchased an echo a long time ago...how did I ever survive without it..simple to use and it knows and finds anything you need...very happy.!!!
5.0,"January 5, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I'm really impressed with the sound quality from these devices and ease of setup and use. Only problem is they occasionally make a beeping sound every few hours. Setting issue?
5.0,"December 27, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Got this one for work, it's so nice to connect home & work together. I can turn the lights on at home before I leave work. easy to set up, unlike so many other tech things I have had in the past.  Love technology"
5.0,"January 29, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,A few more features than my 2nd Generation unit that died on me.  We get an enormous amount of use from our Echo's (we have 2) we really wouldn't want to be with out them.
5.0,"January 22, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Love this for the small amount of space it uses.  I am using it in my sewing room/office which is pretty tight for space.  Convenient to use for music, news, weather, etc."
5.0,"November 3, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,Excellant sound quality great bass best of all my alexa's
5.0,"February 4, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Alexa is good not great. She often gets things I say wrong and I have to repeat myself. The speaker itself is great. Has nice sound and looks great wherever you put it.
3.0,"January 24, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I enjoyed my alexa for about a week before it started messing up.  It seemed to get caught in a cycle that I couldn't get it out of without unplugging the unit and resetting it.  It didn't respond to my voice, it just made a funny noise over and over again like it was shorting out.  Even now, after resetting it, it get glitchy again and again.  One day, it plays a certain music and the next day she says she can't find that.  I have mixed feeling about Alexa."
5.0,"January 18, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,My Hue lightingighting commands only work when my dot is active not sure why. Otherwise all is good.
5.0,"January 10, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Love my Alexa - I am having a relationship with her.  I tell her goodnight every night!  Thought I would have trouble as I am tech inept - no trouble no issues.  Easy to work.
3.0,"December 25, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I went from an echo dot to the echo 3. Along the way I also bought a new echo dot current generation. I found that the sound on my new dot to be amazing, not too much difference from the echo 3. That’s were I find that the echo 3 is lacking. Another problem that I’ve recently been noticing is the connectivity is not stable. In several ocasiona, it starts playing a song and abruptly turns off. I’m still not sure what’s going on."
5.0,"January 21, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"Friends introduced us to Echo while traveling (they take theirs with them), and bought us an Echo for Christmas. Being newbies to it, we are still exploring how to use it."
1.0,"January 6, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,Everything is great except...Alexa somehow engaged closed captioning on my tv’s and I can’t get it off. Even by taking the app out of our phones and unplugging everything.
5.0,"December 10, 2019",Sandstone,Echo,"This thing is so handy to have around, I bought this one for a gift for a friend.  Anything you need to know is just a question away.  It sounds great and I'm not constantly having to charge a portable speaker to sync to my ipad or other devices for music."
5.0,"January 23, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Our first echo and we are very pleased with it. Get up in the mornings and say ""Alexa play some christian praise music"" The sound is excellent. I'm glad we bought it !!!"
5.0,"February 16, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"I love the 3rd generation echo !!! Really highly recommend it ! The sound of the speaker is better than echo dot !!! I love the heather grey color , didn’t have problem hooking it up , this our second one . Would definitely buy again , fast shipping and wonderful product ."
4.0,"January 2, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Absolutely love it. Purchased with echo dot and two smart plugs. Now I can tell my coffee maker to turn on from my bed. Love that Alexa plays music with no commercials or reminds me to call people.
4.0,"January 7, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I needed a new echo for another room in my home, I replaced the old one with the new one in my bedroom.  Everything seems to work fine but the bass seems to be more active than in the old one and makes music and voice with P sounds boom too much."
5.0,"February 11, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I’m loving this device. I’ve wanted an Alexa for a while now so it’s nice to finally have one! It’s simply and ease to use. All you have to do is plug it in and bam! Instant help or news or just weather report. Whatever you’ll use your Alexa for, I’m sure you’ll enjoy it!"
5.0,"January 21, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Better sound than the first generation and much less sinister looking, especially in the blue.  I still think Alexa could sound more real.  Glad I traded in my old one."
4.0,"January 20, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,the sound is great when synced with the echo sub and a second echo for stereo sound. But there is a glitch where sometimes only one plays . i have to stop it and walk to the other echo and restart the play. also have it play different musics. . but when its not glitchin its great.
5.0,"January 27, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,Combined my Alexa with smart sockets (Gosund ) have made my dumb lights smart. Easy to control lights in separate rooms. Still learning all Alexa can do. Pleased so far
4.0,"January 13, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Bought as gift for son. He has been unable to get Double Jeopardy on it.  I chatted with customer support, I was given instructions about resetting skill, I forwarded info, it still didn’t work. He said it was going to be additional $2.99 a month."
5.0,"January 25, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I got this product on Black Friday for a really great price. I am impressed with how well Alexa understands what we say. We listen to a lot of music on it. Sounds good!
4.0,"January 10, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"I love this version of Alexa. I have the original echo as well. The biggest difference between this echo and the 1st gen is probably voice recognition, its can really pick up voices even while music and or audiobooks are playing. The next best improvement is probably sound quality, the bass of this echo is impressive. I haven't needed to push the volume past 6 for music and 4 for audiobooks. This is a very good gift for the right person. Or even yourself. Highly recommended."
5.0,"January 11, 2020",Sandstone,with $10 Smart Plug,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she really likes it.  I like it too.  I got the smart outlet/plug and a lamp for her and it’s works really well.  Very pleased with this product. She wishes it was wireless, hopefully they’ll come out with a wireless one soon."
4.0,"January 12, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"This small speaker packs a big punch!  The sound quality is remarkable and somehow even better than my first generation smart speaker.  Alexa's a.i. is still light-years away from Google, so the value is definitely in the sound technology."
5.0,"January 7, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Instant variety of music at my command via voice requests across the room. No turning on stereo equipment, browsing through tapes, records and CD's. Also, requests for information instantly. Although not all my questions have been answered. That is disappointing and going to the library or my computer still does the job. Maybe the Echo data base will eventually expand and those questions will be answered? Otherwise, I'm content for now."
3.0,"December 22, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Buggy version. In stereo mode. Each time i use a command, there's a squeal before the music starts every time. The left channel led ring stays on a lot."
5.0,"December 18, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,The 3rd generation unit has the best sound yet and is very 3 dimensional. Easy to set up and communicate with. Should have bought a couple more for gifts at the time of the deal!
4.0,"January 12, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"My child often is able to turn ask Alexa to turn off and on (he thinks it's funny) Sound quality is really good for the small size, love that it doesn't take up a lot of space. Individual son's won't play unless you pay for Alex's unlimited but it can play radio stations and music for iHeartRadio for free."
5.0,"December 18, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,Love it!  I upgraded from dot (which now resides in another room) and loving the sound!!!! Omgosh wish is done this long ago!  Very responsive and have had no issues.
5.0,"January 31, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Alexa’s a pretty funny lady 👍 I’m actually just learning how to use my Echo, and so far it’s working out. I like asking Alexa to play songs by artists, which it shuffles up a mix from Apple Music, then I’m good to go for hours. Since I only have one, I’ll probably get another one at some point  so that I don’t need to move it between up/downstairs."
5.0,"January 17, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"This is my first Alexa. I absolutely love it. We have the lights integrated with it and it turns them all off at night or when I leave the house. Not to mention, she keeps my 7 year old daughter happy with all her knock knock jokes."
5.0,"January 7, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,I bought his for my mom who is becoming forgetful. I can ask Alexa to remind my mom of doctors appointment and ask it to play music for her anytime ahead of time. It’s great. Great sound.
5.0,"December 15, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,Great sound quality! I have the first generation Echo and these were much nicer in design and sound quality! Got a great deal during Black Friday. Highly recommended!
4.0,"January 13, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"This is my first smart home device that ties all of my plugs, bulbs, etc together. However, my unit makes random noises sometimes and sometimes it's enough to wake me up in my sleep... not sure why or what they mean. Not even sure what it is that provokes it but sometimes I get very frustrated!! Most of the time, the unit picks up my call for ""ALEXA"" pretty consistently and easily, which I enjoy much better than my iphone's SIRI!!!!"
5.0,"January 19, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I like this far-better than my DOT primarily because I’d the high quality sound.  It’s comparable to a Bose product frankly.  The value in the speaker alone is great.
5.0,"November 12, 2019",Sandstone,Echo,easy to set up great sound
5.0,"January 21, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"We really like the look ...we already have an Alexa..tall and black... but this one looks cuter. I have to say though, our old Alexa seemed to understand better...and we had to sign up for a new billing to have ALL the songs we want played...somthing we already had signed up for on our old Alexa.... other than that..we are enjoying it"
5.0,"January 26, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"There is so much that Alexa can do, we have barely scratched the surface. But I'm learning... not just commands but the setup and condition with my other devices. But I like it! And will add more!"
5.0,"February 1, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"The echo technology is the best thing since bubble gum! I have four of them, the one pictured is in my kitching. Amazon is the leader in this technology of smart speakers!"
2.0,"January 17, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"These units do not work with computer (either Mac or PC). You can only use iOS or Fire to set it up. Very disappointing, as we prefer a large computer screen for low-vision."
4.0,"January 24, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,Sound quality is great new gen are having issues dropping in with some devices and you have to call instead of being able to drop in kind of aggravating however it’s not a deal breaker for my household
5.0,"January 7, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Christmas gift for my daughter and she absolutely loves it.  I didn't realize how many things the Echo does,  now I need to buy another for my other child. :0) great gift.."
5.0,"January 11, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,I have Gen 1 and 2 and so far this one is my favorite. It's not as tall as Gen 1 and a little wider than 2.  It has good sound and works well with voice recognition
4.0,"January 16, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I was looking to start building a smart home and received this as a gift. I give it 4 stars because I have some security / privacy concerns from Amazon itself. As far as the device goes... it works wonderfully! Sound is clean and crisp, and no issues with voice recognition. Integration with a smart plug was pretty seamless and works reliably. It works so well we are getting a Echo Dot for another room"
5.0,"December 21, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,Our new Echo 3rd Gen. is a very noticeable upgrade from our Echo Dot. The Echo Dot was adequate but the Echo 3rd gen. is definitely better. A worth while purchase.
5.0,"February 4, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"We still have a lot to learn about all the the possible use of Alexa.  Making shopping list , asking questions and information but it is all positive. Great purchase."
4.0,"November 25, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,The sound is good from the echo
5.0,"January 4, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"I wanted to add color to my living room so I purchased another Echo 3 gen. Alexa is great as ever but the color red, I'm not sure it's red it's more a faded full red"
4.0,"February 12, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"The way we use it, it's basically a notice-board/calendar/radio, and it's rather good for all that. There are times when she misunderstands the intent of a question, and I wish she didn't try to give helpful hints quite so often. Overall, I'd say she's not quite as smart as Google assistant, but not bad to have around. Also, it would be nice if she had more than just the one voice."
5.0,"January 6, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Gave it to my GF for Christmas.  She was not sure she wanted it.  But after getting home and installing it, she fell in love with it.  Controlling her TV, music, light switches, etc. became the basis of her life!"
5.0,"January 1, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Para mi uso personal, muy bueno un producto de excelente calidad, pero mi recomendación es que deberían tener en youtube un video en español para que expliquen que se puede hacer con Alexa o cuales son las funciones que se le puede pedir por ejemplo yo compré adicional dos Fire Stick y me aparecen en el app de Alexa los dos con mi nombre y no se como aparecieron allí y que puedo hacer con ellos con Alexa, por eso hablo de un video explicativo, o que tiene que ver Alexa con los Fire Stick."
5.0,"December 26, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,This thing is great I have it on all the time by Christmas music through the holidays and this morning I started out with Hank Thompson where else could you find that
4.0,"February 18, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I bot the echo primary for music. The quality of the sound is superb for such a small unit. The echo worked fine for a week or so then it would freeze up almost daily. I would unplug it and let it reset and it would work for another day or so. Amazon sent me a new one and it works much better but it to will freeze up every now and then. I think there is an issue with this new echo. I love the sound but be aware you may have to unplug it and let it reset occasionally.
5.0,"December 7, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,We got two of these. I should have gotten 4. They pack a lot of sound in the small package. I love that I can use the headphone port in the back for either a line in or line out. I currently have a projector plugged into one and it works perfectly.
4.0,"February 18, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"For the price you pay, it’s worth it. Keep in mind, there is little  bass on this, like if your looking for a deep sounding bass this IS NOT going to provide you with that (you’ll have to purchase their subwoofer to get quality bass). Overall it does a great job, sometimes it may not not recognize your voice but I guess it’s always learning and adapting. No product is perfect but this is worth a shot at. Love the color though."
4.0,"November 9, 2019",Sandstone,Echo,I am still learning to use this. I like it.
5.0,"January 17, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I bought this for my 5 year old grandson, who is full of questions and loves music!  One of my favorite Christmas gifts! Great sound! Easy to use!  Versatile! Parents loved it too!"
5.0,"December 25, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,This new generation of echoes is very intuitive and connects much more quickly. It is also more reliable and does not disconnect repeatedly as past versions did.
5.0,"January 21, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,"I really like my Alexa- setting timers, quick fact checks and of course music is my go to uses - but I’m sure Alexa will be used for many other ways as I get use to having her about!"
3.0,"December 31, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,"I had a hard time to get this Echo Gen 3 connected to public wifi, even the technical support could not figure out the problem. My Echo Gen 2 is working just fine. I did the software update but the problem still remains. Sound quality not far superior to generation 2 Echo."
5.0,"January 1, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"This is an amazing product to have at home.  It does everything I need.  It’s like having my own assistant and the sound quality is great, especially with music!"
5.0,"December 30, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Working. I had to unplug and restart once because it recognized the request, however no music asked for came out. Unplugged restarted and everything came along correctly."
5.0,"January 14, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"The first thing I noticed about these new echo speakers, is the bass. I thought they were drowning out my sub but no, they are just great. Job well done Amazon."
5.0,"January 21, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"This was a gift, I love it.  Had fun so far listening to all kinds of music.  From Sinatra, Benny Goodman band to the Beatles.  Great sound.👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼"
5.0,"January 10, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,I have been extremely happy with my Echo and all that it can do.  I am still learning but I am amazed at the capabilities of Alexa.  I can't wait to continue on.
5.0,"December 22, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,This was an upgrade from gen 1.  The sound is a bit better.  That’s about it.  I also like the shorter speaker.  Gen 1 is still around just exiled to the bathroom.
5.0,"February 17, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Huge improvement in acoustic properties over version 1, it even seems to listen better.  Slightly smaller more bookshelf form factor that blends in to the room."
5.0,"January 31, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,I have several of these all over the place. This one is in the stable and we use it all the time. It's great for music and whatever questions we might have from general information to weather reports. It's easy to make calls on too... perfect companion!
3.0,"January 11, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I like being able to listen to music while cleaning or doing my hobbies.  I  can ask Alexa to play a specific song or genre of music.  This allows me to hear my favorites without having to change the music every other song.  However, every now and then,  Alexa doesn't understand what I am saying.  This can be frustrating.  Luckily, it doesn't happen often."
5.0,"December 30, 2019",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"The Echo 3rd generation was easy to start up, has great sound and voice recognition. I have not had to use tech support so I can not comment on that. The thing I love the most is the red color, so pretty!"
5.0,"January 20, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,I use this Echo to listen to podcasts.  The sound is clear and I can set the volume for my.listening pleasure or for those in my household who have a hard time hearing. The Echo was a surprise Christmas gift.
1.0,"November 13, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,After three weeks it would not play music from Amazon or Pandora. So I returned it. I wanted to order a new one but I never received the 20% off for pre-ordering and the person I talk to said that promotion was no longer available. Since I never received it to begin withI would’ve thought an exception could be made
5.0,"November 6, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,better than I expected
5.0,"February 2, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Speaker has a big boom for the buck! My favorite so far. It’s kinda hard to connect the tv to it and the sub and disconnect but its definitely my favorite echo.
5.0,"January 10, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I did not intend to buy the Echo 3 for myself. It was going to be a Christmas present for someone else, but I found the free trial of Amazon music was linked to my account. I decided to keep it, and I have throughly enjoyed it.  It is so helpful and easy to use.This comes under the category of being something for a person that you think you might like. I did and I use it everyday. Merry Christmas to me!"
5.0,"December 4, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,This was a replacement for a 3rd Gen that made a popping sound after responding to a command. The replacement performs with no popping and we're enjoying it.
5.0,"February 5, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"It took me a week to build up to installing my ALEXA ECHO. Once I decided to do it, I was surprised how easy it was. I’m glad I got it, love playing with it."
5.0,"January 23, 2020",Twilight Blue,with $10 Smart Plug,I have 3 (3rd Gen ) Alexa's and have them synced to play all together.  The sounds I get from room to room are amazing.  I might get another one for the den.
5.0,"January 10, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I live in an area that radio reception is limited.  My Alexa is just perfect for my needs and keeps me company.  Looking forward to using all of the features.
5.0,"January 29, 2020",Charcoal,with $10 Smart Plug,This is my favorite echo device. I have several and the value to get the smart plug is also a great deal. I bought them for both my kids too and they love it
5.0,"February 22, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"My mom loved her 3rd gen echo dot, just wanted Abit more volume, this was my solution for her, she is impressed with the increased volume and sound quality."
5.0,"January 8, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,Bought this as a Christmas gift for my brother. He loves it. It works and sounds great and it’s a cool color. I have the dot but will be getting this for myself soon.
5.0,"January 7, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I love my echo, and I love having Alexa to take care of things as fast as I think of them, like adding things to my shopping list and creating an alarm or timer."
1.0,"January 1, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Very difficult to connect to Spotify premium. It will only work on Bluetooth but then Alexa won’t work. Change default to play Spotify and still playing amazon music. If I ask Alexa to play Spotify, it plays free Spotify, and not premium account. You can’t change Spotify music in the Alexa app, only Amazon music. I purchased google home instead and much more satisfied. This Alexa is a waste of money. Wish I could leave less than one star."
5.0,"February 13, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I love my echo ❤️. It’s really like having a smart house. “Alexa, add Avocados to my grocery list. Alexa, play my most recent playlist. Alexa, let’s workout! Alexa, turn on my lights when I get home.” Alexa has really optimized my life. The alarm is nice two. I work two jobs and the alarm wakes me right out of what would have been a 12 hr snooze. The accommodating app is nice too. It’s like having Alexa in your pocket. I highly recommend."
5.0,"December 24, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Love the sound,  if you have a medium size living room and you dont have a portable speaker, this echoe is what you need to listen to spotify or amazon music."
4.0,"January 13, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I switched from another home assistant to Alexa mostly due to the audible compatibility. Still getting to. know Alexa. The sound seems just as great in my dots as this larger speaker.
5.0,"January 10, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Wanted another Echo for my bedroom and this was the current model. Sound is improved from my first one, fits nicely with room decor and was easy to set up."
4.0,"January 7, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"This is my 4th unit and by far, the most frustrating. She just doesn’t listen very well compared to our other ones. The sound is great, no complaints there."
5.0,"December 16, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,The set-up was a breeze and the sound that comes out is unbelievable. I have bought (4) including mine and have given the others to family members. They love it. 👍🏽👏🏽👌🏽
5.0,"December 13, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,Ordered two - based upon family members advice and it was an excellent idea. Two of them make my whole house sound exceptional! Holiday music never sounded so good!
5.0,"February 5, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"While we don't use Alexa for more than a radio,  we are very pleased with the quality of sound.  Specifically compared to Echo dot and previous generation (3) of Alexa."
5.0,"January 23, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"We love our Echo! This has great sound, way better than I thought it would! Only issue is we have to restart it about once a week. Not sure if its the wifi, the plug, or the unit."
5.0,"January 28, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I love the sound and capability of the echo smart speaker. I got a second one so that I could have coordinated sound in my upstairs and downstairs. Love this feature as well as all of the others but.... my two speakers stopped being synchronized. I'm sure it is a simple fix but at this point, I'm not sure how to correct the problem. You'd be surprised at all of the things Alexa can do. So fun. Love the ""lists"" and getting the morning news updates as well."
5.0,"January 16, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Why didn’t I get this earlier. Love the rich sound. Each morning we get the weather, news briefing and then some selected music. Happy with this product."
5.0,"December 14, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,So far this Alexa has been one of my best investments. It does so much and I have only begun to unlock the potential it has. I’m excited to see what else I can hook up to it.
5.0,"December 13, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Didn’t want it in my house, now we love it!! Convenient, so easy to set up 5 yr old could do it, grouping lights are a piece of cake as is the dot set up, and it’s actually pretty fun to have around!"
1.0,"February 23, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,It randomly short circuits about once every 2-3 days. I need to unplug it do to a bug causing it to suddenly sound like an old school cd playing over a ton of scratches
5.0,"January 3, 2020",Sandstone,with $10 Smart Plug,"I can’t believe I waited this long to join the Alexa ranks! This works very well. I use it to listen to music, blogs, get weather reports, get information from the web, get package notifications, and so much more. I haven’t used the smart plug yet. I’m still trying to decide where I want it."
3.0,"December 6, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Works great for some smart home products, but not all. Also if you are planning on using these as speakers, don’t. The blue tooth is the absolute worst."
5.0,"February 7, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I am completely satisfied with this new Echo. Very good sound from a speaker this size. I paired it with a Sub and it sounds great. Alexa works very well and is getting better all the time.
5.0,"January 24, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,The sound quality on this unit has been improved from the previous generation.  The color I wanted kept getting back ordered so I just ordered the grey.
5.0,"January 11, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"The product is awesome. However, I messed up somehow when I activated it using my Alexa AP. It is seeing three units instead of two, so I can’t get the units to communicate with each other. It keeps telling me one of my Alexa units is offline. My error.....but frustrating."
4.0,"January 9, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,So far I have enjoyed it.  It’s in my bathroom.  I just ordered the dot as I think it will better served in a different room.  The sound quality is “AMAZING”.
5.0,"January 30, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I was surprised by the quality of the speaker. Great sound comes from this little device. Alexa is easy to use and she has done everything I have asked of her.
4.0,"February 19, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Great product! Always room for improvement, as there are still some ways you can say things that Alexa won’t recognize. I also didn’t appreciate that she can’t skip multiple songs ahead, but that might just be me. Voice recognition is surprisingly good, although she can often mistake other words for her name. I was impressed with the amount of little tricks Alexa can do, like telling stories and singing songs. Altogether a great device, but improvement is always an option."
5.0,"February 10, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I got it as a gift and it integrates well into our home.  My wife is predominantly the one who uses it.  It recognizes both our voices pretty smoothly.
5.0,"January 6, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I've actually used my device almost exclusively for music, the feature that attracted me to it.  I really appreciate being able to summon up a group or artist in my mind and almost instantly be listening to his/her/their songs.  Alexa has also answered a few questions about weather, store hours, and such.  She's pretty convenient, I must admit, even though I was reluctant to have her in my home."
5.0,"January 27, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"The sound quality is better than the first generation. I feel like it occasionally does not pick up when I'm taking to it... Not sure if I'm not loud enough, or not saying Alexa in the right cadence, but once in a while I need to repeat the wake phrase."
5.0,"December 11, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Better than 2nd Gen. Great Bass awsome sound. Paired with fire stick for sound, highly recommend using for movies and sports. Volume 3 is loud, volume 6 is really loud. Love the speaker."
5.0,"January 7, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,I didn't want Alexa -- but my daughters gave it to me for Christmas.  I keep it in my kitchen/family room.  It's nice coming home from work and requesting music - etc... while I'm settling in to make dinner or read a book!
4.0,"January 22, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I bought this for my mom that wants to hear music through the kitchen and living room. She loves it and has already asked Alexa to play some Bruno Mars.
5.0,"December 26, 2019",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,I love this Limited addition read on the echo speaker. i’m really big about getting items that are limited or special edition. The red is vibrant and deep.
5.0,"January 19, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"What can I say? Alexa knows all my secrets, and now I get creepy ads for things I have mentioned in my kitchen. The audio quality is great, and I use it to control a few devices around the house."
5.0,"December 12, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"This is my first Echo and I loved it! It’s Alexa assistant is amazing and combined with several cheap wifi Bulb adapters from iHaper and one Lifx Mini, I was able to build my Starter Smart Home. I just ordered two small Echo Dots for the other rooms!"
3.0,"January 1, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,The verdict is still out on this Smart Speaker!  I love to listen to music on it and it cuts in and out.  I don’t think it is my wifi.  When it cuts out I ask Alexa to play the radio station again.  My music comes back on and the process is repeated.  I like sound that comes through on the speaker.  My first Alexa only lasted 8 months and the sound was awful.  This 2nd time I bought a better quality Alexa.  Hopefully it will last longer.  Thank you!
2.0,"December 16, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I was looking for a rechargeable speaker not one that you had to leave plugged in, it was a nice speaker but just not what I was looking for as a speaker???"
5.0,"January 24, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Our alexa dot stopped working and we wanted better sound.  It is so nice to have the Alexa to play music and sound great too!  Great base!  Really like it.
5.0,"January 29, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Very intuitive product.  Would recommend for both beginners and avid home integration customers and anyone who just wants some good music on demand.  If you are serious about sound I would recommend the optional sub woofer.  This is going to be one of my next purchases.
5.0,"December 15, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,3rd gen echo has better base and sound at a higher volume. It’s shorter and wider than gen 2 and has some kind of fabric around it which gives a better look
5.0,"January 10, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I have an Echo Dot that I use daily, actually leave on and change stations in morning and night time. I use the Echo much in the same manner as it is located where I stay most of the day, great company!"
5.0,"December 20, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"All I had to do was plug it in and it literally set itself up.  I already had the Echo dots but I wanted a louder speak so that I could listen to my books on tape on room, the sound is awesome."

5.0,"February 5, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo, This has great sound for my shop! I made the stand
5.0,"December 22, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,I am still learning what the Echo offers. I paired it to 3rd party plugs.. Too bad Alexa doesn't have a preferred brand that didn't need to download 3rd party app..but hey it works well... Nest requires you to merge to Google account.. another thing I had to create as well. lots more to learn and setup.
3.0,"January 14, 2020",Charcoal,with $10 Smart Plug,"This is a review for that smart plug that was included.... the Alexa device was a gift so I cannot test To put it simply, the plug is trash. It delays or refuses to turn on 4 out of 5 times and I have tried multiple low amp devices plugged in. The only perk is the rectangular shape. I would almost have preferred NOT receiving the plug"
5.0,"January 17, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,The sound is so much better than with the previous Echo. More bass and better sound overall. Like the more compact size and I bought the battery base to make Alexa more portable. Very pleased !!!

I've put in trouble ticketd with no response on the app, so I don't know if it is a problem with the app or the echo, but something isn't playing nicely together.  It works fine on a lot of things. I can't find the problem to fix it"
5.0,"December 16, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,I’m so glad I moved forward with upgrading from Echo 1! Sound quality is superior and fills my room incredibly well. Sound is clearer and the bass in songs sound great. Definitely recommend.
5.0,"January 16, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,I recently had a Google Home Mini that took a crap on me. So I decided to switch teams and get an Echo. This thing overall is tremendously better than my mini and I am very happy with my decision. The bass is good it sounds great does everything I need it for and looks great!
5.0,"December 28, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"My only compliant about it but I’m no tech guy is that it constantly has to be plugged in to work but other than that for its size, the loudness and sound quality are really amazing. It’s connects to Bluetooth almost instantly. I haven’t had any issues with it"
3.0,"January 24, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,It is a decent product depending on the application.  Everything worked as advertised but the quality of the sound was not better then the echo dot.  I wanted to use mine in the garage but the echo just couldn’t carry enough sound or volume like I wanted.
5.0,"January 31, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I like getting up and asking for easy listening music, It also so says good morning. My wife use's it all day for info and music. Worth the money."

5.0,"February 5, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,Better sound than the generation 2. Alexa works ok. I like the rounded top look. If you already have Alexa setup in your house adding these is super easy from the app. Came a day early straight from Amazon. I’d recommend them but I’m nobody so get one if you want.
4.0,"January 18, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"You have to blast the sound to hear any difference in sound quality from the echo 2. At normal sound levels, it’s hard to hear any distinction."

5.0,"January 24, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I have a couple of Amazon Dots that I love but now my hearing is a little wonky so my son suggested I upgrade to this. I love it. The sound is great, much easier to hear than the Dot. My only complaint is Alexa herself sometimes not understanding me which is why I only gave this a 4."
4.0,"December 22, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,I have two as left and right TV speakers.  They sound much better than the TV speakers.  They fill the room with sound.  Better sound than the echo dot.
5.0,"December 25, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"This is a handy speaker that has great sound quality. Alexa is very helpful as well and setting up the Amazon smart plug was seamless.  I love listening to amazon music as well. Most of the time Alexa can understand song titles even if you don't quite know the exact name. All in all so far I have had a great experience with this Echo. Oh yeah, the twilight blue is a great color also."
3.0,"January 22, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,So far it has way too many times when it just doesn’t work? I use it only for music and nothing else. Yet their have been daily times when it just doesn’t work.

1.0,"February 20, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,"My new Alexis is doing the same thing as my old one.

The person solved his problem quickly and pleasantly. We were surprised at the service during the holiday. He loves his gift, uses it to check the weather every day and to listen to music."
3.0,"January 15, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,It’s ok. It’s not as good as the show. Not even for sound quality or voice recognition. Overall I think it’s kind of a stupid waste of money.
5.0,"January 7, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"Loud enough. Enough bass w/o needing a subwoofer. Clarity is excellent. Running Amazon Music, which is now using FLAC files. Sound great."
3.0,"December 17, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,I bought to replace an echo dot. This unit cannot hear me from the same distance as the dot and it has more trouble understanding than the dot.
5.0,"January 11, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Great with smart lightbulb to turn on lamp. Great with smart plug to turn on other things. Fun family games and nice speaker for music.
5.0,"December 31, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Got this for my 89 year old grandma for Christmas and she loves it. After giving her a list of common things to do, she was quickly able to figure out how to get her favorite music, news, weather, drop in to other Alexas in the house, etc...the family has been using it to stream music and play games."
5.0,"December 11, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Great buy, our second echo and love its functionality and all around features only issu is integration with other products which can be improved"
5.0,"January 6, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,We bought two of these along with the subwoofer and are amazed at the big sound from these little guys. Very happy with this purchase.
5.0,"January 17, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Got this as a gift.  Although I still have the last gen, this has much better sound and deeper base.  Mic does not seem as responsive, and sound level is controlled by buttons as opposed to simply twisting ring.  But it still has a fairly good control of sound level.  Also looks better."
5.0,"January 3, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"Absolutely amazing! Alexa is sooo useful, for a while I had been wanting her but when I finally obtained an Echo it came with more features than I ever imagined. I use Alexa every day; her usefulness knows no limits!! :D Also I got the Red version, and the color is beautiful!"
3.0,"January 5, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I have the Echo Dot and wanted to upgrade it. The Echo Dot is definitely smarter. Perhaps I have a defective unit but I am returning it
5.0,"January 3, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Love it.  I use it for music, timers and shopping lists.  Works the best.  I am sure I have just scratched the surface of her potential."
5.0,"January 21, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,Alexa and I are learning but the overall quality is much improved.  Speakers sound much better and I think there is a big difference in quality.
5.0,"January 5, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Easy set up and outstanding sound quality compared to the older versions. While it may not be a big deal for some, the newer generation units are much better looking too."
5.0,"January 11, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"Sound quality is where is this unit shines— much better than the previous echo versions, which I actually really liked!  Better than most Bluetooth units on the market, just not as portable..."
3.0,"January 6, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Limited music player interface. It's not very good that it's only limited to certain music streaming apps.  Would love to use YouTube music for more specific music listening choices.
5.0,"January 7, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Still learning, but I liked it enough to purchase the dot.  Now my kid can listen to her music in her room and I can listen to mine ."
5.0,"December 24, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Set up is painfully easy!!  😊  Audio quality is very nice, and basic equalizer functions can be ""ordered"" verbally, and it responds.  It looks nice and just works.  We like it!"
4.0,"January 12, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I really love my Alexa. It is unreal how smart she is. She will even play the music I like and the sound was really good, even the bass."
5.0,"January 6, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Our first generation Echo had an option to adjust the volume by turning the top, the third generation does not. However, the sound quality is much better and the volume control buttons on top work just fine and the voice command can be used without manually controlling the adjustment."
4.0,"February 7, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,Very happy with my purchase of the Amazon Echo 3rd Generation.  The voice recognition is amazing without any training needed. The sound quality is very good for this size speaker.  The number of Skills is fantastic.  Will recommend this smart speaker to friends and family.
5.0,"December 16, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,Sometimes Alexa doesn’t know the answer. She doesn’t talk unless you say ‘Alexa. But this echo sounds great & connected to my WiFi right away!
5.0,"November 1, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,I love the Alexa Echo.. I also have the Dot .. The sound on the Echo is fantastic
5.0,"December 1, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,Impressive improvement over Gen2
5.0,"December 28, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Even if you have a stereo on one room, this is a great speaker to listen to music in the other room. Much better than the echo dot."
5.0,"December 22, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,I really love Alexa. here lil funny story though. So i was on call with a friend of mine and i was in kitchen cooking. she has alexa to. I ask alexa if she knew how many mins put someone on to cook for my alexa claim she didnt know but my friend  had me on speaker and her alexa told me. That sooo funnny! I told my Alexa now why you couldnt tell me why yo twin sister had tell me through phone LOL
5.0,"December 26, 2019",Charcoal,with $10 Smart Plug,The echo will not hear the trigger word from time to time. The plug (alone) is TO DAMN EXPENSIVE at 25 dollars. As a bundle I should have purchased more than I did.
5.0,"January 20, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,I bought the Alexa because i wanted a newer one. I don't regret it all.  My daughter uses it as an alarm and she asks Alexa so many questions.  She uses it as a learning tool.
5.0,"December 13, 2019",Sandstone,Echo,I was very pleasantly surprised at the good sound quality. I’m definitely purchasing another and the sub-woofer for great 2.1 sound.
3.0,"January 16, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Voice recognition and other features work as well as other models. However, this unit freezes often.  It just stops working during extended (several hours) music or book playback.  You have to unplug the unti to solve the problem."
5.0,"January 23, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Purchased this to have one in our condo at the beach and it setup easily and sounds great! Very happy with the quality all around.
5.0,"February 13, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Love the light, plug, Xbox and tv voice controls. I can now easily turn all appliances off(so can the kids, no more “I forgot to turn the lights off”."
5.0,"January 30, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Great sound and she responds well to questions or requests. It would be nice if it could have a wireless option to bring outside.
5.0,"December 29, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,Great sound from this speaker - I have several dots and added an echo to get bigger sound in our basement I was not disappointed.
5.0,"January 24, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Like the fast response time, Recognization of different voices, how easy it was to connect sound is pretty powerful as well. Clear sound love that it works with many different apps and music programs. Use mine with Apple Music but has many options."
5.0,"January 3, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Purchased this to replace my 1st gen echo that just stopped connecting to my internet after several years of use. It's super handy!
1.0,"December 14, 2019",Sandstone,Echo,You have to keep telling what you want Twice or three times before it’ does it is annoying. But when the musics plays sounds excellent but deal breaker you have To repeatedly say it again 🙄
3.0,"February 10, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,The vocal side of the speaker sounds like a tweeter in a bucket. Even after you adjust the equalizer it sounds like a small speaker in a bass tube.
5.0,"January 7, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,This is a really nice upgrade to the echo dot that we had. Still does all the normal things but with a much better sound system.
4.0,"January 6, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Great integration, very pleased with sound quality compared to my 1st gen.  Pics up my voice from around the corner very easily."
5.0,"December 25, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,My wife had the 1st one when it came out. Wow what a difference from the 1st 1 to this 1 she loves everything about it in the sound quality is actually amazing. She has 70% of our lights control by Alexa including plugs as well and NO hub required
3.0,"February 8, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"Pros: Looks cool, great sound and good features. Cons: Doesn't curse. Gets things completely wrong, for example: I said ""Play Juular by Devin Townsend Project"", and she says ""ok, playing Thriller by Michael Jackson"", how is that even remotely close, and not even the same genre. And this is irritating, she wants to play some mainstream you never heard of when you are asking for classics made by great musicians."
3.0,"December 7, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I previously purchased two Echo Dots and wanted to give the Echo a try. Everything was fine, great sound and look. But it completely died after one week. The power supply was just fine (18v), but no lights/response and it was also plugged into a surge protector. Amazon support was awesome to work with. It has been returned and new one has been shipped. I wonder if I just got a lemon?"
5.0,"January 9, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"Sounds are real good. I bought 2 of these and make them as one pair left and right,  works perfect and sound so good in my store."
5.0,"February 21, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,Fantastic revision! Hands down the best Echo to date. The sound quality is very good with nice bass. I definitely recommend this Echo.
5.0,"December 12, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Honestly, the best speaker I've ever purchased. Bought it on Black Friday and it has been amazing. ""Alexa, set an alarm for 8AM"" ""Alexa, play _ on Spotify"" ""Alexa, turn on TV"" (after I've linked it to my Samsung TV) It has very clear sound quality and doesn't sound mumbled when volume is maxed. Looking forward to buying the smart lights, items to sync her with the entire house."
5.0,"February 16, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"I got this as a Christmas present and I absolutely love it!! Especially with the smart bulbs I bought, I am not sure why I didn’t get one sooner"
5.0,"February 8, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I am enjoying learning new things Alexa can do each day. I have integrated it with my lights and music so far. Looking forward to many more functions.
5.0,"January 5, 2020",Charcoal,with $10 Smart Plug,From time-to-time Amazon offers one the ability to purchase an Echo and then add-on a smart-plug for what is effectively about $5.00.
4.0,"February 5, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Alexa is great and Amazon has such a wide range of music and things to choose from that makes her so good. I love everything about her except at least once a week she gets crackly and can’t be understood. Unplugging and replugging does the trick.
4.0,"January 29, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Althoug I had planned to use the contents clearly sealed for each meal, they all were mixed up and I found I could not use them."
5.0,"December 24, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"We love our Alexa Echo's. They are amazing!  They work well, they sound great and we are impressed with how easy they were to set up!"

1.0,"January 20, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I bought this as a Christmas present. It worked great, but it’s not even been a month since Christmas and it won’t even turn on."
1.0,"January 29, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"It doesn’t pick up voice recognition well. It has a hard time finding Alexa enabled devices, and a lot of times it does not follow through with a command."
5.0,"December 4, 2019",Sandstone,Echo,"Just got it recently, I've been using the 1st generation echo before and I was very satisfied with it. However, Amazon allows you to return the former echo for a gift card. So, I turned the former one back (getting $25 gift card) and get this new echo for only $60. The sound quality is great. Pairing is very easy as usual. For the price, this is more than what I expect. Good looking and great sound!"
5.0,"December 24, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I never knew it could be so fun!!! Did you know you can play music (like super annoying music) while you aren't home... but your boyfriend is. oh man good times!on a real note, the sound is awesome! I love it!!"
5.0,"January 9, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"This is a fun little speaker. Packs a great sound as well as all of the Alexa ""skills"". It has the ever important ""mute"" button."
5.0,"January 21, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Love this echo! Easy set up and wonderful sound that you can adjust through the Alexa app. Very pleased with this purchase.
5.0,"January 22, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Trying to find smart plugs that are easy for me to set up, Amazon works fine, others not so much. Front room connects great, wirks just as I want."
5.0,"December 21, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,"This is certainly fun to have in your home, I am enjoying everyday  I have only positive things to say about this product Who doesn't love Alexia!!!"
5.0,"January 10, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I like the fact that I can shut the microphone off at anytime. I have used it to find out the temp outside, when is sunrise & sunset  & answer questions so I don’t have to go online to goggle to get answer. Used it to play music & just love it!"
5.0,"January 23, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,We are getting acquainted with what Alexa can do. We appreciate it more and more and look forward to learning additional features.
5.0,"February 15, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I’ve had the echo dot for quite some time but needed a stronger speaker with the Alexa functionality so I upgraded. I was very pleased with the sound as it fills a large room quite nicely! I will be purchasing more in addition to the echo show.
4.0,"February 11, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Arrived quickly, easy to set up, recognizes voices quickly.  Wanted it mostly to play music, but most of the songs I want aren't available and get replaced with other songs I don't want to hear.  Takes a while to learn how to ask the questions the right way to get the answers."
5.0,"December 31, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"The sound on Echos just keeps improving. I am still delighted after a year and a half with my collection, which is finally complete now for every-room coverage. They still have trouble ""dropping out"" occasionally after an hour or two of play, but that's usually remedied by simply repeating instructions. Hopefully software updates will continue to improve performance in that area."
5.0,"January 23, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,Much better sound quality than my 2nd gen echo. I want to pair it with another echo but it will have to be another 3rd gen echo.
5.0,"February 7, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,The speaker is clear and has good bass. Connecting all devices has been simple. Easy to control lights and such while on vacation.
5.0,"October 30, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Everything amazon puts its name on is quality. What more can I say! I run my lights with it, runs my fire stick, and can ask any question and get an immediate response. Sound quality is excellent. Never disappointed."
5.0,"January 9, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"We are still getting used to having Alexa in the house.  I like it.  The Echo seemed like the best choice, I still think so."
5.0,"January 2, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"better sound then last gen, like that its smaller, picks my voice up well, love it, i have multiple echos. and def recommend"
5.0,"December 11, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I’m very impressed with this gizmo. At the age of 70, I am not a Techie but I was able to install and set it up with no problem. It’s fun to talk to, and the sound quality is very good. Thinking of buying another for a gift."
5.0,"January 12, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,I does so much and has a personality of its own.  I am anxious to learn quickly about all it can do and the other items it can work with.
3.0,"December 1, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"This thing sounds amazing and set up is extremely easy.  Alex nice to ask for news, weather, music etc......not portable...WTF...."
3.0,"December 19, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,Just wish I would have gotten the google version of this...Alexa is good at what she does but If you’re trying to get one of these things as a way of asking for answers to questions that you have it is pretty much useless...
5.0,"January 27, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,Replaced one of my Dots with this unit. Sound is worlds better. Volume is much higher than the Dot while retaining great sound quality. And i caught the price at the right time!
5.0,"January 30, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,I love this product! I want one in every room. Incredible sound quality and love the fact that it can sync to multiple music platforms.
5.0,"December 16, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"My husband told me to get this for myself so I can’t set timers and all other things...little did I know it’s a gift the whole family can get a use out of even just for humor...I think my son who is 14, my husband and myself spent 2 hours in silence just playing around and enjoying Alexa"
1.0,"January 31, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I received as a gift this holiday season. We tried to use for weeks but our Labrador canine of 11 years changed her behavior immediately after purchasing this device. From reading on Amazon forums,  there is a major high pitch frequency issue that makes dogs act like they hear thunderstorms and fireworks every time you say they word Alexa. I experienced this with my dog. We had to put the Echo back in the box. Too much stress on her."
4.0,"January 12, 2020",Heather Gray,with $10 Smart Plug,"This unit plays a few songs in suggested genre, then stops.  It also sometimes shuts off for no reason.  This was a brand new purchase, does it have a warranty?"
5.0,"February 20, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"I love the red color, it is absolutely beautiful and looks amazing in my game room. Sound quality is awesome! Very pleased!"
5.0,"January 8, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Love the stero sound with music. Don’t like the fact that it’s listening all the time. Enjoying it more then I though I would.
4.0,"January 30, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Great sound, gets loud, good for my house. Does not always recognize my request or plays the wrong songs. Great with weather, recipes, etc"
5.0,"January 12, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,Great- mostly used for music. They should have a lock as I have a 4 and 6 year old and they don’t stop with asking Alexa things...maybe a better voice recognition to only identify my voice- I don’t know what would work best. I currently changed the prompt name from Alexa to one of the choices - seems to work now bit my 6yo is catching on.
5.0,"December 30, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,Very good sounding speaker.  Fills up a room.  Not gonna blow your socks off. But works great.  Have two of them.  Love em
5.0,"January 31, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,"We are enjoying this very much, it is much better then a radio for listening to music, you just say what you want to hear."
5.0,"February 14, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I think this is one of the best gift I have ever received its so much fun and there's so many things that you can do with it
5.0,"February 17, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Onev of the best purchases  I have made. I use it constantly for music,news, weather reports, etc. It is incredible"
5.0,"February 2, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Alexa is so easy to use. I just plugged it in and joined my WIFI. I later connected smart lights and just tell “Alexa, lights on”"
5.0,"January 21, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I don't like that owning this product comes with encouragement to buy lots more products to enhance what it can do. I like the sound quality and ability to listen to radio stations via the internet.
5.0,"January 9, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Super easy to pair with my router a fun to use. I don't have music channels on my TV and listening to my iTunes play list gets old. Alexa will play what I ask even if I don't know the whole name of the piece or album. I check on the weather, get headlines and just about anything I need to know. My only regret is that I should have had one long ago."
5.0,"January 7, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"We have an original large Echo, an Echo Dot, a second generation Echo, and now this one.  The sound quality on this one is the best of them all, even better than the large original Echo.  I would recommend this to anyone."
5.0,"January 11, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,This gen 3 has much better voice recognition vs. gen 2.  Sound quality is also much better.  Definitely a worthy upgrade!
5.0,"February 23, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,"I bought a regular Bluetooth speaker about a foot wide, but skinny, for 80 bucks and it sounded like it could just be a basic 25 dollar speaker from TJ Maxx. I decided if I was gonna pay 80 for that I’d pay another 10 for the Alexa. I returned the first speaker, got the Alexa, and never have I ever spent a better 10 bucks. SOUND QUALITY IS GREAT. VOICE RECOGNITION IS GREAT EVEN WITH MUSIC AT FULL VOLUME. Small, but LOUD AND CLEAR."
4.0,"February 21, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Its all good but after a month my ECHO speaker started to overheat and i had to unplug it for a bit to cool down. Also before i notice that it was overheating it wasnt responding to anything that say and i had to get real close to it so it could hear me. Im giving 4 star because it just didnt one time and after that it seems fhe problem its fixed and now i own 3 more of them
5.0,"January 4, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Our first Alexa thingy. Still getting used to yelling out song requests. Fun. Appreciate the good Speaker quality for the price. Pretty cool. Works great.
5.0,"January 14, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Got the echo for myself and the echo dots for the kids! I can’t believe I never purchased these before! Amazing feature to have in our lives. I love music, my daughter loves book! It’s an all around amazing addition to the house."
5.0,"January 27, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Enjoy listening to music using Echo (3rd gen) using Amazon music, great sound, clarity and connectivity. Quality built and just the right size!"
3.0,"February 5, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"The sound quality is as expected and delivers very good sound for our kitchen space. There are issues with the device sputtering out of network connection for no reason. I called customer support and they had me reset and reboot the device, and also suggested some of the channels may be better than others (?) Many times I just unplug the device and let it reconnect to our 5G network and then hope for the best"
4.0,"December 23, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I have 3 Amazon echo's for different parts of my home & I love them, however, the sound quality is not as good as I would like.  You get what you pay for is a good thing to remember!!"
5.0,"December 31, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,Music or talk radio primarily with weather reports around the US. We have an Echo in our bathroom for the same purpose.
5.0,"January 6, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I installed two to make quick and easy stereo speakers for TV. They sound great and I also added a sub for awesome bass.
5.0,"January 18, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"I took the trade-in offer and replaced my 1st Gen with the 3rd. Speaker quality is bit better and I like it just as I liked the 1st, but as other people said, I do miss the rotating ring on the 1st Gen."
5.0,"February 19, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,"What an awesome gadget, although it is like having another teenager around and you always have to tell her what to do😋.  The phone rings, Alexa! Turn it down!😁 We love Alexa. I am thinking about getting one for work."
5.0,"January 13, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"My husband has Familian Tremors.  This makes his life much easier to get music, information, and facts quick and easy."
4.0,"December 18, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,I bought Echo on a 5 month payment plan at regular price 2 weeks before Black Friday.  Unfortunately Amazon would not give me the sales price adjustment even though I still owed 4 months on plan. I wasn't offered any work arounds to take advantage of 40% off sale.  Too much trouble to return and re-purchase.  Disappointed but Echo is a fine product.
5.0,"January 17, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"This thing sounds great and voice recognition is very good, especially for not costing hundreds like an Apple thingie."
5.0,"December 14, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,My husband is only 49 and had a fall at work shortly before Thanksgiving which caused a subarachnoid brain bleed. I bought several in order to place them around the house to allow me to check on him via my phone thru the echo devices using drop in features and linked them to home devices making it easier for him to control. They have worked fabulously for these reasons as well as the popular features often seen in commercials.
5.0,"January 8, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,Very easy to set up and to use. Amazon makes sure you know all of the possibilities for using your Echo. I now can listen to my siriusxm on the echo...
5.0,"January 13, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Echo was easy to set up. It comes in very handy around the house. In addition to the great music, answers to many questions are available by the sound of your voice. Those trivia questions that nag you because you cant remember. Those measurement questions in the kitchen or at your work bench. many other capabilities I haven't tried yet."
1.0,"January 30, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Bought this for my husband for Christmas because he like to listen to music and it promised improved sound over echo Dot. It worked less than a month and shut off I don’t have box any longer

5.0,"December 9, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I received this as a gift and just love it.  It was easy to install (my grandson said so)and super simple to use.  I use it to play music (that's free if you're a Prime member), get weather reports and get info.  The best gift I've ever gotten was my first Kindle but my Echo is a close second."
3.0,"January 25, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,The sound is somewhat better than that of the echo dot. I plan to try one from Bose to see if I can get the overall sound quality I'm looking for
5.0,"January 28, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,This was a Chrustmas gift and so far I really like it.  I enjoy being able to set a timer from anywhere.  Very handy.
4.0,"January 22, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"I like the voice quality which is pretty great as of this price. I mostly use Apple Music to connect with Echo. I’m not very familiar with amazon music but in the future I may choose to use it more because the interaction between Alex and amazon music may be better, which also means Echo shall be improved in the connection with other music apps. Alex can’t catch me all the time, like some misunderstanding of the word I said."
5.0,"December 27, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I love having Alexa around to turn my home into a smart home.  It allows me to turn on lights, listen to music, get news updates, access my calendar and so much more.  I plan to expand and get some echo dots too. The sound quality is very crisp."
4.0,"February 21, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"I asked Alexa to destroy Bixby, Cortana,  and Siri, but she's ""unsure about that"". Hopefully someday she figures it out."
3.0,"January 27, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,It makes random noises for no reason. Had to call support to get it to integrate with microwave and fire stick. The sound quality is ok. The problem is that it rarely recognizes commands . It is almost as bad as Siri
5.0,"January 8, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I like it only thing is when I tell it to play music from Apple Music it says i need to link it even though it says in the ap that I am linked to Apple Music. Other than that i like it! Gets loud for how small it is.

3.0,"December 6, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,I ordered the twilight blue thinking it would look like the picture. Wrong. It's more like a dull pale demin color and not the pretty blue as indicated in the picture.  I would have chosen the gray if I knew the blue was going to look so bland.
3.0,"December 31, 2019",Heather Gray,with $10 Smart Plug,"Like my old echo dot better, quite frankly.  Sound quality is more deep and loud than with the dot, but not as clear and crisp."

5.0,"January 12, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"So far, one month in, this has been a nice addition to our living room. Between the tv, lights, and vacuum it makes being lazy that much easier. Gone are the days of finding a remote. Over are the daily tasks of sweeping up pet hair. Going to bed is so much easier as the lights simply turn off with a simple command. The Jetsons would have been proud."
4.0,"January 10, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I got the Echo to have music in my sewing room, and it’s working quite well.  I was a little disappointed that the “blue” really looks gray in most lights."
4.0,"December 28, 2019",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,I bought it solely to have another Echo for a different room.  I wouldn't know the difference between the 2nd generation and the 3rd.  I'm as satisfied with it as I am my 2nd generation Echo.
5.0,"February 22, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"I like how Alexa works with my WiFi lights,  thermostat and fire tv. I also like the routines and sound is awesome."
4.0,"January 16, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"We love the echo devices. We had 3 dots already and added this one because we wanted better sounds quality in the larger room. Uses are pretty limited (lists, setting timers, music, weather) but that's plenty for us given the low price. Docked one start because we fairly regularly have problems with it hearing us particularly when it's playing music. It's on a window sill so maybe reverberation is why."
5.0,"December 5, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,"Was happy with the 2nd Gen, but needed to add another.  I feel the improvement in sound quality is very noticable."

5.0,"December 13, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,It took me a long time to join the ‘smart’ home movement but I’m so glad I did. Having lots of fun getting to know Alexis and all she can do.

5.0,"December 21, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,I upgraded my old echo gen 1 to this new echo 3rd gen because of the sound quality and I’m happy with my decision.
4.0,"January 13, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Hubby got me this for Christmas because it looked like fun.  Not entirely sure what I was expecting given nothing in my house is not ""smart"" I have really only used it to play music and it seems to make a great little speaker nonetheless and some things she says are pretty comical. Was nice of Amazon to offer a smart plug for 99 cents so I can hopefully start to see what else this little baby can do."
5.0,"January 16, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I love the convenience of Alexa! But I’ve only used it to listen to music.  My WiFi is pitiful so can’t always enjoy.
5.0,"January 30, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I love my Alexa . The only issue I cannot get ant bulb to work with it  to turn on and off my light. I spoke to amazon and they told me what to do, but still I had to return the bulb back, the connection did not work as people said in the reviews.  Its say I need a hub or such.  So am not happy about that. To explore other things Alexa can do. And that it has be plugged always . That needs to change I mean alexa... lol"
5.0,"December 13, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,Just bought the echo 3rd gen and its a big improvement over the echo dot 2nd gen that I had. Better overall sound and looks. Buy it!
4.0,"January 15, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,Me parece excelente todo los servicios y funcione que tiene echo el color me parece óptimo ya que se diferencia bien entre los otros dispositivos sin caer en el clásico color negro en mi caso que básicamente es el que más veo por lo general
3.0,"January 31, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,It did not integrate as we hoped...sounds good with music but not good as a TV sound device.
5.0,"December 21, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,This little speaker has the best sound of my 3 Amazon Echos. It has deeper bass. I can play music throughout my home.
4.0,"February 15, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Great sound and soooo easy to set up.  Did not give 5 stars only because it has no battery--- has to be plugged in to function.
5.0,"January 7, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"This was a gift for my husband who is visually impaired.  He particularly wanted to be able to ask for favorite radio stations.  He is very pleased with his ability to do that, and with the quality of the sound."

5.0,"December 13, 2019",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,I was debating getting another Alexa. I outfitted my home with Google home. While google worked it was slow and sometimes unresponsive. Alexa was always on point with great sound. When the product (red) line was released I hade no doubt I was replacing google home with the new echo red. I love it so much better. I only wish the echo dot was also in product (Red).
3.0,"January 18, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Not as easy to work with as you may think.  Frustrating at some points when an obvious request is misinterpreted.
5.0,"January 10, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Used this Echo along with the Echo Dots and Echo Plus to setup a sound sys. in my house, played Christmas music in all room ""at the same time"", LOVE IT. Sure beats installing speakers and costly sound systems. Great sound. Also purchased the ""Ring"" door bell. Love it, don't know why I waited so long."
4.0,"December 26, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"This 3rd gen is an improvement over my 1st gen Echo in terms of sound quality, but is still behind a bit compared to my HomePods in my gym. The microphones in this gen seems to respond a lot better over previous especially when you ask for a command while audio is currently playing. Overall improvement in my opinion."
3.0,"December 23, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,Expected a little more sound quality. Echo does not hear my commands often... and keeps responding to a wrong command at times... eh...  I know it's a work in progress... but it does well for  what it is. I'm satisfied.
5.0,"December 16, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Very good bass, mid and treble are clear and are comfortable to listen. You need to download an app. But it is easy to set up. I bought it on Black Friday at a discounted price. Very good value for the money. Highly recommended."

3.0,"January 5, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"It’s better than the original one I had, the first generation. However, I don’t think that it’s come so far that it’s worth a 5 star rating"
4.0,"November 7, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,the sound is okay.  not the best.  i wouldn’t say it’s as good as my karmon speakers or anything.  obviously better than the echo dot.  I don’t regret getting it so far

4.0,"February 21, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Like many buyers, I miss the rotating volume ring. But, the problems it seemed to cause with audio failures are not missed. Also, the fabric exterior and color choices are very pleasant to the eye. All in all, a great buy and performer."

4.0,"January 22, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"I am a bit of an audiophile, so I am being very specific about likes/dislikes. I wish I could sharpen the sound quality...I find myself longing for a crisper treble and presence. Otherwise this was a great investment.

5.0,"February 1, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,Great product. So happy I got it. I think even picks up my voice better than the fire box. The only thing it the sound sync with other Alexa devices doesn't work that great.

5.0,"December 16, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Works great with Apple Music. Sound Quality is great at mid range, but if you turn the volume higher it almost sounds as if the speakers a ripping. Its great for apartments but if you wanna add it to a big house its not worth it. Great design."

1.0,"December 24, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,Not good at really anything. Always says alexa is learning and she does not understand. If you just want time date n music shes good but most everything else she dont understand or u have to be really specific n exact. People dont talk like that usually

3.0,"November 14, 2019",Sandstone,Echo,The main problem with this speaker is the sound. :-) Too much bass. No mids. Tinny highs. The result is at lower volumes it sounds terrible. Gets better as it gets louder.
5.0,"January 1, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Gifted this to my brother for Christmas and he spent the rest of the fat listening to music and playing with it. Bought smart plug with it and he loved it! Sound is loud and crisp and bass is awesome.

5.0,"January 13, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Alex I can do anything pretty much we just love it ask questions, make shopping list, Etc....."
5.0,"February 17, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Good product fir the service provided. Got this for my wife and she lives it.  My wife would say the most notable feature is the ability to organize your schedules and to do lists through voice with Alexa.
5.0,"January 5, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I like how the design is simple and how Alexa has been working in tandem with my computer space. Only downside is sometimes she likes to talk over me when I tell her to stop xD like VERY LOUD over me. I dunno if it’s a feature but she’ll randomly increase volume, maybe my roommates have been telling her to be louder without my knowledge. Anyways it’s a great buy."
4.0,"January 27, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"This was my first of its type. Works very nicely, don't have to shout for it to respond- a little too much base playing music but ok."
5.0,"January 30, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,Echo is a great product. Alexa has many capabilities. We’re learning new ones every day. Would highly recommend this product
5.0,"November 5, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"This is my first Echo and I love it. I have friends who have them but older generations. I find the speaker on this to be really clear and full. Alexa, please don’t tell Siri I’m cheating."
5.0,"January 26, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Now I need to replace my old Echo's with this new one. I thought the old ones were great, but it exceeds my expectations!"

5.0,"February 1, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"This is my first foray into Alexa, super happy! I wanted a home speaker so I don’t have the tv on all the time. I only wish I had three more to truly rock out!"
5.0,"January 26, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo, Alexa plays music well when asked to. Was very easy to set up.
2.0,"January 30, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,There is a know issue with the Alexa app equalizer settings resetting themselves to default after being set to the customers preferences. This issue is approx a month in the working of being corrected but has not been resolved. My question is why? It's code! Rewrite it!!
5.0,"December 15, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Love this little speaker. The setup is a breeze. My only issue is not with the speaker itself but with the app. The music control section of the Alexa app is a bit clunky, specially if you are using a third party music library, like Apple Music"
5.0,"December 24, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,installation was very simple compared to the experience with the original echo dot a year ago. i use it for a speaker in my home office and the sound is great for casual listening. i have no rating for tech support because i haven't needed any.
5.0,"January 22, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Sometimes it doesn't recognize my voice. It could be that it is next to my TV. When I turn the TV volume off, it does pick up my voice."
5.0,"January 25, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I received the Echo as a gift for Christmas, and am still learning all about it.  I love using the work-out options, and we played some trivia right away when we got it set up. I have used it for timers, and asking how far it is between certain cities for travel purposes. So much to learn, and it is helpful to get the emails to help with this."
5.0,"January 3, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I bought one for each of my kids for Christmas. They all love it. They listen to their music, use it as an alarm. Great quality."
3.0,"January 16, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,After connecting to Amazon Music or Pandora etc. often times only one song will play and the Echo will disconnect and you have to restart.
5.0,"January 6, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I like the varies options it has as far as playing different music. Still trying to understand Alexa’s full capabilities because I know it could do more than what I’m using it for right now. Stay tuned!
5.0,"February 14, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I upgraded from my Dot and live the quality of the sound. It really makes my music sound great.
5.0,"January 18, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"I really like having this, we are still finding ways to integrate it into our lives.  Right now we have one smart plug and enjoy having it turn and off the television.  We have our grocery list on it, find out the weather, and are learning more and more ways to use it."
5.0,"January 15, 2020",Twilight Blue,with $10 Smart Plug,My grandson loves this and listens to it all the time ... he even has music play while he sleeps
5.0,"February 18, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"So great to have music, weather, driving conditions, school closings and random information in an instant!"
4.0,"February 15, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Much improved upgrade from the privious model. Deeper bass. Clearer highs. The size also makes them much more discreet in the home.
5.0,"January 22, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Never thought I would enjoy Alexa but the Echo is great! Works well & very convenient for more than just music. Grocery lists, timers etc. Love it!"
3.0,"January 5, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),with $10 Smart Plug,I’m not noticing much improvement from the original one I’ve had. I hope to notice differences soon.
5.0,"January 10, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Bought for the living room area. Attractive and effective. Voice recognition is on point. And the speaker is pretty impressive.
5.0,"January 31, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I love the sound of the speaker. I have 3 Alexas. They work great as speakers working together
5.0,"December 15, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,The depth of sound is very good. I have noticed some slight distortion with some of the highs.
5.0,"February 11, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"The sound fills up our living room. We love it and so do our kids, “Alexa, play Frozen 2 music...”"
5.0,"February 12, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,It was easy to set up and for the most part it is very responsive.  The sound is a great improvement over the echo dot.  Listening to music is so easy with it and the sound is really good from something so small.
5.0,"February 16, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I returned the Studio and kept this! Can't beat the price and the sound, also very convenient!"
5.0,"January 22, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,One if things I use it for is playing music of my choice in my room to exercise to or just to listen to music.
3.0,"January 6, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I don't like that it requires location information to be installed but besides that it is nice.
4.0,"January 28, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"We finally got on the Alexa train and love it! The only reason I have not given it five stars is because it ‘statics’ and cuts out which is extremely annoying. Sometimes once it does that she has shut down and does not respond for a while. Otherwise the sound is great! So far all we’ve used her for is music, jokes, grocery list, timers and alarms."
5.0,"December 6, 2019",Sandstone,Echo,Sound is better quality than my Bose wave. Had the Echo first generation. This is no comparison. It’s like your grandmother keeping the old 21” tube television rather than upgrading to a 50” flat screen. Very satisfied.
5.0,"February 18, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"The sound is great , much better than the other version, I was really surprised at the sound for the price"
5.0,"December 21, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Great product. Love its functionality. Guard Home option is great, even if you have an alarm at home, and cameras. I do recommend this product for others to buy."
5.0,"January 20, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,Absolutely love this device. The sound is amazing and it can literally make your life easier
5.0,"January 15, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,got 2 so I could link with the Sub and make a stereo pair..  for my basement sound system...
4.0,"February 4, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,For entertainment. Disappointed with music it has to com through Amazon and they don't have access to many of my selection
4.0,"January 18, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,This seems maybe a little better as far as sound then Alexa 2. but just not that much better
4.0,"December 24, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,Alexa cannot find any of Beethoven's five piano concertos. I subscribed to Music Unlimited but Alexa does not tell me when the music I ask for comes from Amazon Music or Music Unlimited so I cannot determine if what I am paying for is worth the price.
5.0,"January 9, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I have set 2 of these up as a stereo pair + sub mostly for streaming Spotify. All good but I wish I could also stream YouTube Music ..
4.0,"December 30, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,Very good product...I uses echo dot before made this echo even more outstanding....my opinion thz
5.0,"February 13, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,I love how convenient it is. Kinda creepy when she randomly starts talking abiut random things though without triggering her name. She can whisper which makes her sound more human its really funny.
5.0,"January 12, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,My girlfriend has one. We play it and dance to it every time I am there. I bought one for my parents for Christmas and they love it. Good sound quality and can play quite loud. I can't imagine needing the larger model unless you were planning to be playing it in a very big area with a lot of people there.
5.0,"January 10, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,Voice recognition is unreal... Sound quality is great... still learning everything that smart speaker and Alexa is capable of.
5.0,"January 29, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Excellent sound quality for music. It’s very close to my Bose system that cost a lot more.
3.0,"February 16, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"Product worked fantastic but I noticed after a while things weren't working the way the usually do. The alexa feature now takes multiple attempts to play the simplest of songs and will sometimes act like it never heard me. Then I noticed that I've been needing to constantly up the volume cause it doesnt hit with the same punch anymore. Overall it was good, while it lasted."
5.0,"February 1, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Ordered for my Aunt.....she is thrilled with this! I have 2 in my home and love them!
5.0,"January 9, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,music sound much better than the echo dots. Easy to set up. Was a great Christmas Present.

5.0,"January 13, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I love my Echo Plus Smart Speaker.  First thing in the morning I ask for the weather, wind speed, etc and then I ask it to play music, a speciific song or artist, and more."
5.0,"December 27, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"What even more kooleer is if you have more than one Alexa echo speaker you can pair them all , create a group for an entire home entertainment audio system. One in the living room, one in the bedroom, one in office room etc. Then apps like Spotify will be able to see the group as and audio output , allow music all over the home. Try it."
5.0,"January 24, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Brought  this as a Christmas gift for my sister and she loves it and can't stop talking about it.
5.0,"December 29, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,I now have a six speaker setup and it’s like going to a rock concert every time I put music on.
3.0,"February 14, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Had a 1st Gen Dot and upgraded to this 3rd Gen Echo. It hasn’t been much of an upgrade at all. The new echo often returns errors when asked to do simple commands which we never ran into with the dot. Sound quality is much better but overall functionality is bad.
5.0,"January 24, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Im old school and finally broke down and bought this.  It has made my life so much easier.
5.0,"January 8, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Now she is in another part of the house---busy woman!  Great to have music of our choice.
5.0,"January 31, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,I use it for music.  It was a gift.  I don't know all the ins and outs of doing much with it.  I guess that is the integration part.
5.0,"January 6, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Changed from echo dot and the transition was quick and easy. The sound quality is incredible. Already we love it.
5.0,"December 16, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I bought the third gen to replace my second gen. The sound is much better, a little shorter and rounder at the top. I bought two additional as gifts. I think the third gen hears me from a greater distance. Since I was replacing the second gen all I had to do was plug it in and it set itself up.  Happy with my purchase!"
1.0,"January 11, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Participated in the trade in offer and sent in a perfect working condition echo.  I later get an email saying it is rejected and I will be charged the $25 offered with no real explanation and no help from customer service.  Please be aware if you participate in this chances are they will reject yours and charge you more.  Just hoping i get back mine and it still works.
5.0,"January 16, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,love having this integrated with my system Music is clear and works great with smart TV.
5.0,"December 8, 2019",Sandstone,Echo,"Love this Gen3 Alexa, it was an upgrade for me from Gen1.  Can find zero faults - love it"
5.0,"January 13, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,Great!! This was an upgrade for us as we had the previous model. And we think the sound quality is so much better!!
5.0,"January 16, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,it is quite a convenience we didn’t think we needed. But we love those conveniences and especially the speaker because we listen to music all the time.
5.0,"December 18, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,The Gen 3 is a little larger in diameter than the previous Echos allowing for a little extra Bass response.
5.0,"January 24, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I love this Echo version, 3rd generation. Has a deeper sound quality, is louder without distortion and the microphone understand me more clearly from across the room. Thank you Amazon for improving my favorite smart speaker!"

5.0,"December 18, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"Great sound quality. Never knew how much I was missing bass from my dots until I plugged this bad boy in, especially with Ultra HD."
4.0,"January 9, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Not super sound sensitive. Was cumbersome to link to LG UHD Tv. Not as unique as used to be. Needs to universally link to all wireless accessories. Not just proprietary ones.
5.0,"January 7, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"This Echo was a gift from my daughter and her boyfriend and I wasn't really sure I would use it.  The Echo has come in very handy for so many things for sports scores, weather, recipe and just playing music.  We have the Echo in the kitchen which is very convenient and it really doesn't take up too much counter space.  It was also very easy to setup."
5.0,"December 17, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,Has been very helpful in many way. It tells me the weather and the forecast. I can set a timer. I use it for reminders.  The music is great and easy to use.

5.0,"January 30, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"I'm really enjoying my Echo. I received one as a gift and began using it to listen to music. The sound is definitely adequate. I liked it so much I bought another so I could create a stereo pair.  Setting them up was quick and easy. If you fancy yourself an elite audiophile, this speaker may not meet your standards; but I love music and for the price, they are the perfect little pair."
5.0,"December 10, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,"Used for shopping, music, daily news  ect. Dislike not understanding my voice sometime."
5.0,"December 9, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,Use for creating list for shopping and things to do.  Music access is quite often used.  I have the original that is still working very well. Purchased this to use in another location.
5.0,"January 15, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I love that I can link this to others and listen to the music playing in whatever room I go into.  I have also amused myself greatly by programming responses to questions like ""who's the best dad ever?"""
4.0,"December 30, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,The latest version of the Echo (3rd generation) is a very nice step in the right direction - smaller with a much nicer finish and no loss in sound quality.
5.0,"February 2, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,You can literally whisper and it will here you! You can be on the other side of the house and she still hears you!!!
2.0,"January 31, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I'm disappointed that you totally botched the trade in deal and ended up charging me the $25, even though you received my previous Echo within the required time frame."
5.0,"January 7, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"Ever since I saw the VERY first Echo devices made I thought that these smart home devices were awesome.

1.0,"December 2, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,This speaker has no crispness or clarity of speech.  Very hard to understand spoken words. Sounds like the speech is coming from the bottom of a tunnel. The Audio Settings have no effect.  Definitely would not recommend.

I love to listen to music on my sound bar, but I must say the sound quality on this device is really good so much I use it daily now. Another thing I really love is that I can be pretty far away from it and it responds to command quickly and is very accurate. Definitely looking into buying more products like this!"
5.0,"February 22, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Sound is better then the last 2 I have purchased.  Voice recognition is great as well.

5.0,"December 20, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,This Echo replaces a first-generation Echo Dot we be had for a year. The sound coming out of this speaker is amazing and enables me to not have to pair my JBL Bluetooth speaker for great audio.

5.0,"January 4, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Always thought about getting this but now that I have been adding smart home devices I love have a single app that can run all devices.

3.0,"December 23, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,I like how it’s very responsive but when I tell Alexa to turn off my light(Sengled)I need to tell Alexa two times and it’s very inconsistent. But overall it very good product. Sound quality could improve but considering the price it great. Should have an option to choose the cable length but it’s fine. Super compact.
5.0,"January 12, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Love it.  Sound quality is superb.  It replaced a Google home device.  Very pleased.

5.0,"January 1, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Really like my echo 3rd Generation smart speaker It says that it does not support Bluetooth However It Does support Bluetooth because I am able to pair it with my phone and play music from my phone on it.

However the voice recognition is pretty poor, she always mistaken’s my voice with my brothers voice while my brothers google speaker never had that problem. Alexa can also be stupid SOMETIMES, like not putting the right song on when asked. Overall I enjoy it, definitely worth buying."

3.0,"February 4, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,i do not like it at all dine it can’t sync with youtube via Alexa app because of amazon stupid does not carry google’s products. amazon music does not has free vietnamese music. i will not buy any amazon alexa products. gave it away to my niece.
5.0,"January 7, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"Tucked away in the living room.  Plays music, tells jokes and gives us the weather.  Sure there will be more when I get the hang of it!"
5.0,"January 8, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,"Just like the Gen 2 Echo, but better!  Set up was easy and now we can have music playing throughout the house."

5.0,"January 31, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"I previously purchsed  an echo dot 2nd generation. The sound was adequate, but this echo has great sound that I can enjoy."
4.0,"December 28, 2019",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"Alexa 3rd gen sounds real good.  Used it around Christmas time.  Trained it to my voice but others would ask it questions too.  This may have caused it not to be able to always understand.  Sometimes we would have to repeat question a few times.  Good speaker with nice bass, sound fills the room."
5.0,"January 21, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Love the music, Love the information it can provide, weather, traffic, time, almost everything you can obtain from a dictionary and encyclopedia."
5.0,"January 21, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I find I ask the weather/temperture and can hear the music I want with great sound.
2.0,"January 12, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,I have to reboot this thing about every 3/4 days. It will just stop playing for no reason.  I ask it to play music and it says it will but then nothing plays. I have to unplug it and start it again before it will play... I mostly bought it to play music for my dogs while I’m at work. I’m going back to my Sonos.
2.0,"February 6, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"A lot of issues making calls to other Alexa's, not great audio. Pretty much given up and returning to previous gen which doesn't have any issues."

5.0,"January 17, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"For a 3rd generation, this version of Alexa was pretty good. Sound quality is amazing, voice recognition is superb, but one thing that annoys me is that Alexa will loose connection and glitch when switching songs on AMAZON MUSIC and you have to reset Alexa to fix it."
5.0,"December 12, 2019",Sandstone,Echo,Great sounds. It works faster than the older modes. Definitely worth the trade in.
4.0,"February 4, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Love this!  I only wish it was cordless so I could easily move it into a nearby room and so there was not a cord on the counter top in my kitchen where it usually lives-  maybe a charging doc that it could sit on (still would have a cord, but a short one).  Sound quality is great."
4.0,"February 21, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,"I’m a British West Indian with an American twang, thus I find myself repeating my request to Alexa a lot.  I’ve tried Amazon resolute by acculturating Alexa to my voice, however, this did not resolve the issue.  To be fair, I have the same problem with all artificial intelligence."
5.0,"December 26, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,I replaced the 1st generation with this one and I'm thoroughly impressed. Its a great device and fills my home with great sounds.
5.0,"December 10, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,Bought this for my mother in law for Christmas. We love all of our amazon echos. Helps make your home smart with easy and without killing your budget!
5.0,"January 25, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,I returned an Echo Studio in exchange for this speaker. Sounds as good for less??. I would like to see Amazon add a feature to be able to block specific songs. (not necessarily  X rated.)
5.0,"January 4, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,I had the Echo dot and the sound was not good. It sounded like a tin can. The Echo has great sound and is the perfect size for my bedroom or anywhere. It is a great value for the quality.

5.0,"January 9, 2020",Charcoal,Echo, Excellent sound especially with 2 3rd gens and subwoofer..my phone may not have recorded it good enough for you to tell the true sound quality of these bad boys!
5.0,"January 13, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,Very happy with this device. I am loving all the features it has. I’m continually finding new things it does. I purchased 2 dots and an Alexa show. Awesome way to connect the whole family
5.0,"January 11, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"We are enjoying the new addition to our family,  Alexa is great for our shopping lists, games, workouts, cooking and yes the name of the actor we can't remember. Feeling lazy turning on devices just by talking, we've only touched the surface of all she can do but looking forward to the journey."
5.0,"February 2, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"This was a gift, it’s the third one I have bought so I am very confident with it."
5.0,"February 19, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"I love how the echo connects easily to my iPhone playlist as well as my Apple Music selections.  I love the quality of the sound of the music coming from the speaker.  The only problem I have is that it, sometimes, has difficulties finding my intended song.  But, that might be an issue with Apple Music.  I have not used it for any other function at this time."
1.0,"January 9, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,I have 2 echo 3rd gens and an echo sub as a speaker set. They are the worst speaker set I've ever used. You get 1 song or an hr max of play time until they randomly disconnect. Completely useless pieces of garbage.
3.0,"December 26, 2019",Charcoal,with $10 Smart Plug,"A lot of bugs, with the volume level and drop-in mostly. The sound is not that good. I prefer the echo dot 3! I thought it was an upgrade. Not good enough!"
5.0,"February 18, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Sound is definitely better than the echo dot with the same great Alexa options for smart home controls and routines.

5.0,"November 9, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,Omg the best so far ...
1.0,"December 20, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I had a hard time to set it up and update my current location and since I did not able to change it even after I changed my address in the app, I returned it.

5.0,"December 19, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"Awesome stuff with good sound, this works just like other Alexas just better sounds then echo dot so much better of course better speakers looks nice too"
5.0,"February 10, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Works great in the kitchen/dining room.  Just the right amount of volume when hosting.  If you had a larger area you wanted to use it in you may want to pay for the next size up speaker system!
4.0,"January 1, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Great sound boost but not worth full price. Wait for a sale. Got mine for $60.

5.0,"January 13, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"It’s louder than the previous generation echo. I really love my Alexa, I ask it everything and I feel like I’m more prepared for the day when I leave my room."
5.0,"December 27, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"It works well, we just need to learn how to phrase requests properly to get the response we need. We purchased a Fire Stick at the same time and they work well together. The speaker on the echo is very loud and it also pairs well with a bluetooth speaker to extend the range."
5.0,"January 18, 2020",Twilight Blue,with $10 Smart Plug,"I had a dot and wanted something bigger for my living room, this was perfect. Very loud for playing music and alexa picks up my voice from a good distance away. The smart plug is awesome, I'm definitely buying more."
5.0,"December 13, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,The twilight blue is a refreshing new color that made a color choice an easy decision. The sound quality is significantly improved even though I never had a problem with my 2nd edition sound quality. I like that the design now matches my 3rd edition echo dot. I am happy all the way around.

4.0,"February 13, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,The 3rd generation is really a good speaker for the money.  I'll get another.
4.0,"December 27, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,Just a bit better looking and noticeably better sounding than second edition..
5.0,"December 24, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,The Echo 3 is great around the house saves so much extra time when you have smart lights. Honestly is a great device for your dollar. The voice recognition still allows other voices to take control but works. Haven’t had to use tech support. Anyways I love the device and wish I could have some more to link up to eachother I just wish the smart lights were cheaper 😂😂.
5.0,"December 23, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,Works well. Great customer support when I had problem syncing two devices.

I was instantly surprised with volume and depth of speakers. Alexa promptly responds to voice commands. Would recommend this smart speaker. Also like the twilight color.
4.0,"December 14, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"It has good sound but compared to 1st gen, the sound is a little muffled. Also I really miss the volume ring. It’s still a very good speaker. Am keeping my old one and giving it to a friend for Christmas."

4.0,"January 30, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Great quality! Only thing I’ve been a little disappointed with is that I’ve had to relink my Apple account several times for no reason. Not sure if it’s a bug with the software but a little annoying. And it doesn’t always play the music I tell it to. But overall I’m happy with it.
5.0,"December 20, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,Sounds amazing! I had the echo dot connected to an external speaker and doubted whether the echo 3rd gen will sound better.

5.0,"November 12, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,Really like sound and size of this new Echo. Easy set up and works like a charm.
4.0,"January 2, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Bought in December 2019. Music quality is especially good only in Stereo.  Biggest disappointment is not being able to link music on other devices to both speakers.  Stereo sound quality only works through Wifi streaming.
3.0,"January 1, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"The sound quality when compared side by side with the smaller 3rd generation speaker was not abundantly noticeable.  Sure it can play a little louder and offers a little more dynamic range, but not an additional $50 worth.  It is also annoying that you have to have two of the same speaker to put into stero mode versus allowing you to use two different speakers."
5.0,"January 7, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,It sounds great to me.  I'm also impressed by how well the microphones pick up my voice.
5.0,"January 29, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,This is my 8th Echo (including the Automobile Model).  All are great.  The latest model is the best!
2.0,"February 8, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,It doesn't work as well as the small I ordered about a year earlier!! I expected it to work better but it does not.  I ordered it so I could listen to WMWK family radio from Milwaukuee 88.1 but Alexa cannot find that station.  The little elcho from last year can find and play it but not the new larger more expensive one.  Very disappointed!!!!
2.0,"December 22, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,"El producto es bastante fantástico y genial, me ah dejado asombrado un equipo bastante eficiente y activo formando parte de una inteligencia artificial amigable aunque, sin lugar a duda hace falta la conexión por vía bloutouh, ya que tiene la debilidad de algunas redes inalambricas; El problema sería solucionado con este tipo de conexión."

If my wife tries and gets the error message I can try a short time later and it will work.  Must be chauvinistic or as my wife were to say my voice isn't deep enough.

Why cant I just tell alexa to do something instead of going to the app to do it? biggest issue for me is seamless integration of multiple echos and dots. I never really know what i am doing or if i have been successful."
4.0,"December 28, 2019",Heather Gray,Echo,It works great as long as you have great WiFi and amazon music. It kept kicking me off of Apple Music so I had to get a subscription for Amazon music and I haven’t had any problems since.

4.0,"December 21, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,I bought this because I wanted better sound for my music. The quality is not any better than the dot. It is louder but no base for the music i like to listen to. Save your money and just buy a good blue tooth speaker.

5.0,"January 6, 2020",Limited Edition (RED),Echo,Got it for xmas. Been using it everyday since. Love the sound quality of it.

5.0,"January 3, 2020",Heather Gray,Echo,Sound is nice....much better than Echo dot
3.0,"December 22, 2019",Twilight Blue,Echo,Good sound in most cases. If the bass is heavy on some songs it acts weird and bopping sounds emerges. Sometimes it will stop the music and strange sounds can be heard I would have liked to talk to Tech Support?

5.0,"December 27, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,I wish there were actually was tech support. Then I could figure out exactly how to work it sometimes.
4.0,"January 20, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,"The speaker has great sound quality and is normally very responsive. It is a very helpful thing to have. The only issue I have found is that the commands aren't always received. Alexa's lights will turn on as she heard the start up word, but she doesn't respond to the rest of the command. Works very well overall though."
5.0,"January 14, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"The sound is much better, way better bass and midrange, plus you have an equalizer in your Alexa app. Also seems to hear you much better, don't have to yell to get her attention."

1.0,"January 23, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,"It has to be plug-in all the time making it difficult to move it from one place to another. It doesn't act as a stand-alone Bluetooth player.

5.0,"February 10, 2020",Sandstone,Echo,I love the ease of this- so much easier then SONOS but the disadvantage is on Pandora I can't look at my phone to see who is playing.  That is the only negative and the ease of the devise outweighs that one negative when comparing to SONOS.  I have both and love both!
5.0,"January 8, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,This was a gift to me and I love it more than I could have imagined.  The music quality if wonderful!

1.0,"January 12, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,Received one of these for Christmas. The thought was nice but I have no need for freaky robot surveillance in my home. Do you? Note: this might be useful for people with limited mobility. Otherwise it is an unnecessary piece of Skynet tech.

5.0,"December 12, 2019",Charcoal,Echo,"I purchased this as an early Christmas gift for my family.

3.0,"January 27, 2020",Twilight Blue,Echo,I have yet to figure out how to get it to keep playing music when my phone isnt in range. I tell Alexa to play music when home and try to play for the dogs when I'm gone. As soon as I leave the house with my phone (amazon music app) it shuts itself off.
2.0,"February 3, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"Not as good as our previous Alexa. No Bluetooth capability, many songs are not available unless you upgrade and pay. Can’t play this and an echo dot in another room at the same time without one shutting off. I wouldn’t recommend this device to a friend."

5.0,"January 14, 2020",Charcoal,Echo,"The sound is so much better than the dot.  It does listen and mistake it’s name and start talking when you don’t want it too, but as long as your cool with Jeff listening to you, well worth the money for a nice speaker."
