3.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Good Product...But I Got a Lemon,"My Echo Dot 3 output jack (3.5mm) failed 6 months after I bought it. I was outside Amazon's 90 day warranty period but still figured that, given that the product was only 6 months old and pretty obviously defective (not to mention the fact that I have years of doing business with Amazon without having returned anything), Amazon might step up and replace it. No such luck. So, buyer beware. That said, I still like the Echo products (and would give this one a 5 star rating except for the failure and more to the point, Amazon's failure to stand behind their product) and even the one that ""failed"" still works as a stand-alone Echo...I just can't plug it into a bigger sound system which is what I bought it for. Electronic products tend to fail relatively soon if they're going to fail at all so I assume that mine was simply a rare anomaly. I currently have two different Echo products and both work quite well. The speakers are surprisingly good (both sound quality and volume) considering how small they are. The bigger Echo naturally sounds better than the Dot 3 but the Dot 3 isn't bad for the size and price (assuming you bought on sale at Best Buy or Amazon...$22-25 range). The microphones on the larger Echo are noticeably better than those on the Dot 3 but I can still frequently get the Dot 3 to respond from 1-2 rooms away. All in all, I saw no particular use for these things and didn't want to like them (think privacy issues). I ended up with one almost by accident and am now waiting for delivery of my third one...so, they got me. It's hard to explain because nothing do sounds all that great and yet, once you have them, they're just so darned convenient. I use them almost constantly to listen to the radio, podcasts, Amazon Music and Audible books as well as asking simple questions (weather, whether it's going to rain, time, word definitions, basic Google searches). I'm hooked...save yourself.Less"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Excellent option to add Alexa capability at home,"Verdict: the Echo dot adds Alexa capability to your home, or multiple rooms, at a fantastic value Value. The Echo dot provides access to the same Alexa capabilities as all other Echo devices but at a significantly lower price. If you don't need a powerful speaker in a particular room because you don't listen to music in that room, then the Echo Dot is perfect. We added Echo dots in a couple of rooms to control home automation: lights, thermostats, and switches. Installation. Once unpacked and plugged in, the Echo Dot is immediately ready for connection. You can set it up through the Alexa app from any smart phone or tablet. Just follow the instructions to connect it to wifi and then it will just work. Sound. Despite its size, the Echo Dot sounds pretty good! If you use the ""Alexa, play music everywhere"" command, then all your Echo devices will play the same music in every room that has an Echo device. So these Echo Dots act like ambiance or surround speakers throughout the house. Functionality. I really have no complaints about the actually device. It works well, the physical buttons are practical, and the sound is good. The ring light provides useful feedback about the device listening to you or working on a request. The amplitude of light also indicates the volume level. Overall, it is a fantastic device at an incredible price. I highly recommend it, as long as you are comfortable with potential privacy implications.Less"
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Echo Dot 3 Gen,"Great little device, I received it free for purchasing the Echo Show 2nd generation along with a Phillips hue light bulb, great promotion from BestBuy Includes Echo Dot (3rd gen) and Amazon Smart Plug – everything you need to start your smart home.

5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,The Amazon Echo Dot 3rd generation is great,"Back towards the end of 2018, I bought 2 of the Amazon Echo Dot 3rd generation for $50,00 at BB. When I got it home, I was surprised at the sound quality from such a little device because the sound quality is very good. I have used the device to listen to my radio stations on Pandora and my local FM music stations and my all news radio stations on the AM band. Note the device only works with your wifi; it is not a radio receiver. If you have an amazon music library you can play the music you have on amazon.com. I have used the device with some smart plugs to turn on and off electric heaters. It is a very useful device since you can ask it all kinds of questions, and it responds like Apple Siri or Google Assistant. I liked it so much, I went to BB 2 more times, each time buying 2 at a time for $50.00. I have a total of 6 of these devices in different rooms of my house: Living Room, Kitchen, 2 Bed Rooms, Bathroom where I can use it as a shower radio, and a Game Room. When you can get the device at BB 2 for $50.00 or 2 for $60.00 ($30.00 each), it is an especially good value. The device responds to queries/commands directed to Alexa, and Alexa is getting smarter all the time by amazon adding ""skills"" to what she can do. I opted for the Echo Dot in Charcoal which is very attractive. Final comments: What sold me on the device in the first place was the review on youtube by Craig's Tech Talk...On youtube look for ""New Amazon Echo Dot 3rd Generation - Unboxing and First Impressions"" where you can find out all about the device and see and hear how great it is.Less"
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Surprisingly good sound for such a small speaker,"I own several 2nd generation Dots and have been using them for a couple of years. All of them are connected to external speakers because the sound quality is not good for music. But this 3rd generation model is a big step up in sound quality, and on sale, it's a really good value. I bought one on sale and was so impressed with the sound, I bought a second one (also on sale) so I could set up what Amazon calls a ""stereo pair"". Using the Alexa app on your smartphone, you pair the two devices (they must be the exact same Echo model) so that they offer real left-right stereo. This works with the streaming music services which the device supports. It does not work with Audible books, but stereo isn't really important to me for audiobooks. The stereo sound is really good for two small speakers with a total cost of about $60 (on sale). It's not as good as two full-sized Echos, of course, but at more than half the price and such a small footprint, it's very impressive. You aren't going to get room-shaking bass or crystal clear highs, but you also won't get annoying distortions, even at louder volumes. The device is larger than the previous generation, but still small enough to go almost anywhere and be very unobtrusive. I think it's the best value in the Echo line.Less"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,"Very nice ""assistant,"" searcher, & music source.","This Echo Dot was a pleasant addition to our recent (smart) TV purchase. After downloaded the Alexa App to a phone or tablet, it is easy to set up, and Amazon's phone support was also very helpful. Just say, ""Alexa, play Mozart (or Diana Krall, or Dave Brubeck, etc.), and if you're an Amazon Prime member, the Echo Dot will play an assortment from Amazon's extensive free music collection (or ask you to sign up for a free trial if you request something available only through an additional subscription). We found the sound to be a bit tinny, and bought a very good, inexpensive, external speaker (OontZ Angle 3) that connects by Blu-tooth, and can be used while plugged its charger is connected (saving you from having to charge the speaker after 14 hours of use). That set-up gives surprisingly good sound quality for music and responses to questions. The Echo Dot also controls our smart thermostat (and can control other smart devices and lights). All you need to do is use the Alexa App to connect the Dot to your wi-fi router, and you're all set for a nice ""assistant"" that will answer questions like, ""What is the temperature in Duluth, Minnesota? or outside now (and tonight)?"" ""Who is Lady Gaga?"" or any number of questions you might manually have to search for on the Internet.Less"
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Great gift for the in-laws!,"I noticed that my in-laws recently started using a Bluetooth speaker paired with one of their phones. Since I am already sold into the Echo-system (see what I did there?), I thought the Echo Dot would be a great next step into experiencing voice assistance -especially since I know they had Prime. The Dot is well made, looks nice, with a simple interface featuring the mic on/off, volume and power. It has a fabric finish around the device that hides the speakers. The physical installation only requires to plug it in. However, one must download the app and link it to an Amazon account. I did take some time in explaining how to use it to them. However, once everything was done and set up, it was easy to show them the commands, features, etc. They especially loved that they can listen to their local radio and listen to the kind of music they love. I think I may need to show them more commands on the next visit. They did tell me it could be a bit louder and I thought that it was a bit muffled. Also, the plug may be a little too big and makes it difficult to plug in other stuff on the same wall outlet. In the end, I think the Echo Dot is a great entry to voice assistance. It's relatively easy to set up and easy to use -especially if you have Amazon Prime. It is great for small rooms such as bedrooms as the sound is not as loud. Maybe the next step for them will be the Echo Plus?Less"
3.0,3 weeks ago,Best Buy,It's OK,"The Echo Dot 3 is an attractive, compact device. It's a decent speaker with good, clear sound. Where it falls short is where you need it most. 1) Alexa's voice is WAY TOO LOUD! More often than not I find myself just unplugging at night to avoid the temptation to speak the wake word and have her blurt out at high volume like some drunk girl at a party that's already wound down. As it is dependent on wifi, any command while not connected will prompt a super loud reply, like say volume down while using the bluetooth function to stream shows or music. Same for when it connects to a device. She just yells out the device serial number. I've tried to find ways to quiet her voice level vs music and I just don't see the option anywhere. 2) For it to be a smart speaker that is compatible with smart devices it sure doesn't seem all that smart. It still needs to be manually connected to other devices that A) that are in the same network, B) have Alexa C) Have Alexa under the same account... D) Are streaming Amazon content. Feels like 2008 all over again. The Alexa app is ok but nowhere near as intuitive as it should be. 3) Echo Dot 3 is NOT a portable, speaker as it has no battery. Maybe they're saving that feature for the 4. I've never had a desktop speaker that I couldn't take with me. There are however 3rd party devices available to remedy this. Overall, like I said, decent sound device. As long as you have stable wifi and the patience to constantly adjust the volume and to the situation you should be fine with it.Less"
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Helped introduce me into the smart connected home,"First, I'd say to never buy these. They seem to give them away for free all the time (when bundled with a actual purchase like arlo lights or ring cameras). With that said, even if you do buy them, wait for them to be on sale because that happens all the time. We love these products. No they dont have amazing sound quality, but they work great to create a smart connected home. They are a low profile and affordable way to put alexa everywhere in your house so no matter where you are you can issue commands to trigger routines or functions, check weather, facts, or to send messages. We use bigger echos to pump out higher sound, but we place these in rooms we dont use as often to help create whole home audio when cleaning or hosting. Theres plenty of in depth reviews about what these can actually do, so to keep this simple and shorter - they're easy to set up, easy to use, and offer amazing quality for their intended use and personally helped me realize the benefits of updating the house to a smart house - I first started with two dots, and now have several shows, echo plus, smart plugs, locks, bulbs, and cameras. The dot is a gateway drug!Less"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Love Alexa,"I am really enjoying the Amazon Echo and it’s variants (dot, studio, etc). I have a variant of Echo in every room of my house (love the everywhere feature for music). It’s nice setting up programs (“routines” as they are called) to automate simple things of our daily lives. IE: Give me news and weather and some light music after I dismiss my morning alarm; make an announcement at home to my family if I am near a grocery store in case anyone needs anything; intercom’ing with my kids down stairs to tel them dinner is ready or to do their chores; having Alexa automatically ensure all lights and TVs are shut off at a set time to save on energy bills; setting the heat/AC from anywhere in the home; and much much more. The sound quality is great on each variant with the Studio being beautiful sound. My next purchase may be an Echo subwoofer to add to the depth of the Studio. All in all, the 3D sound is great. There are occasional hiccups with a speaker, but a quick power reset has fixed anything I have ran into. All in all, I love the Exhos and it’s Alexa app!Less"
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,"Better than 2 Gen , Love it!!","Sound quality is the best I've heard on a speaker of this size!!! Definitely worth paying a little extra for this one over the 2nd generation model. I'm not going to discuss the functionality as there's tons of info already out there. One important note: If you set up the Alexa app on your phone, IT WILL IMPORT ALL OF YOUR PHONE CONTACTS. I didn't think I gave it permission to do so but Alexa did indeed import my contacts! You may have read stories how, WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE, Alexa can record what's being said in your home and then send it to ANY or ALL of those contacts! Yikes! And, I won't want any of my kids to accidentally send messages to or call people on my contact list. So, if you want to keep your contacts from Alexa and prevent that from happening here's how I did it: Before installiing the Alexa app on your phone, export your contacts to a file and save it for later. Then, go back to the phone and delete those contacts (don't worry, you'll import them back in later). Now, install the Alexa app on your phone and go through the set up process. At some point, you'll have the option to allow Alexa to automatically import any additions to your contacts. Please ""disable"" that option. After you're done with the installation, you'll notice there are no contacts in your Alexa app! Now, you can import your contacts back into your phonebook using the file that you initially created and you're good to go! If you already installed the app but want to delete your contacts from Alexa, it's not too late. Simply export your phone contacts to a file and save for later. Then, delete the contacts from your phone. Now, open the Alexa app and click ""Contacts."" On the Contacts page, click on ""Import Contacts"" and enable it by moving the button to the right side. This will cause Alexa to replace your existing contacts with the now empty phonebook. After a few minutes, your Alexa contacts will be gone. Go back and disable ""Import Contacts"" to prevent Alexa from importing them in the future. You can now import the contact file that you created back into your phone. Of course there may be some contacts you do want to use with Alexa. I simply added them manually by clicking ""Add Contact."" I hope this info is helpful as I wasn't able to find an easy way to manage Alexa contacts."
4.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Better than previous gen Dot,"Got 3 of these for a good deal to replace some older Dots, and allow me to shuffle my setup around to maximize my coverage. One of the new Dots actually replaced a 2nd gen Echo (full size) on my office desk because I realized that I never ever ran the Echo at a high volume and its superior quality sound was better used elsewhere in my house. But to compare apples for apples, this generation of Dot does seem to have a richer/warmer sound quality than the pervious generation, particularly at higher volume . Other than that they seem to have the exact same functionality/limits and capability. Setup seemed to go smoother than with the previous generation but I think that is more an upgrade to the Alexa software package than the hardware. One thing that surprised me is that with the new style with the fabric wrapping and the rounded top it is slightly larger and at least to my eye slightly more noticeable/conspicuous than the 2nd gen Dots. They do match nicely with the Echos that I have in other places and for some reason that matters to my wife. You might guess that I am committed to the Echo-sphere and you'd be right.Less"
3.0,7 months ago,Screwfix.com,limited usefulness,"I only got this because I thought it was a portable speaker and I wanted to use it in the park. When I realised it was just an Alexa thing, I decided to try it out - I'd seen the technology being used in 'Years and Years' and thought it could be useful for me. Specifically, I wanted to use it in the kitchen so I could listen to stuff without touching any buttons. Was very impressed at first that I could switch it on and off and change volume etc. However, playing specific tracks on spotify was tricky - I'm thinking particularly of an aria from The Magic Flute. Also, whenever I wanted to play stuff from one of my playlists it was either play from the beginning or shuffle that I could do - no precision. Also, listening to particular podcasts on bbc sounds. It will play the most recent episode of a well-known soap on radio 4, say, but it couldn't detect 'Cerys on 6 music' no matter how I said it - it would just play 6 music live. I also wanted to select Guilty Feminist podcasts, and I couldn't do that. In summary, if you want to listen to the weather forecast or the radio - live - then it's fine. But if you want to listen to specific things, you might find it annoying. I found myself shouting at Alexa and think I must have looked very strange. My other gripe was that it only works if it's plugged in, so is completely useless as a handy extra portable speaker.Less"
4.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Great upgrade from previous Echo Dot,"While this is larger than the previous Echo Dot, the rubber like material on top and the mesh wrap around is a step up. The sound quality and increase in volume level is what I found to be the biggest improvement... That said, I feel that there is no true mid level volume. My experience is that if I’m looking for that “sweet spot” it doesn’t exist, as it’s either quieter than I would like it to be or louder than I would like it to be. I did purchase two Dots for one room for the purpose of stereo sound. This is where I believe Amazon fell short. For the last few years, I have been able to use a pair of very inexpensive Bluetooth wireless speakers at the same time for listening to music from my cell phone & laptop. With the Dot, you are limited as to what will play in stereo and what won’t. I feel as if I have taken a step back in time with respect to technology as relates to this issue. My only other hope for future Dots is that they make them waterproof. Again, I have wireless Bluetooth speakers that I can attach via suction cup to my shower wall. I’d like to be able to take advantage of the smart home I’ve created, forged on the foundation of the Echo Dot when I’m in the shower, or anywhere there might be water. Bottom line, for the price you can’t beat it. Amazon has made improvements. I am hoping for refinements with the next generation Dot.Less"
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Works well and set up was very easy,"My elderly mother absolutely had to have one for Christmas. I got it for her, set it up, and got it going without a hitch. It works really well and the music sounds great out of it. I linked several skills for Mom at her request such as the InTouch Devotional program and Pandora very easily. I really have no complaints. My elderly mother; however, feels differently. This is not the Echo Dot's fault. Mom just doesn't understand how Alexa works and they have a stormy relationship. She thinks Alexa doesn't listen, but Alexa does. She thinks Alexa doesn't answer correctly, but Alexa tries as hard as it can to decipher what Mom is trying to say. Mom doesn't understand that a music subscription is needed for Alexa to play the music she wants right away. I warned Mom about all of this, but she thought she and Alexa would live well together. They do not. Over the last year, Alexa has been moved slowly more and more out of the way. The last time I was at Mom's house, Alexa had disappeared. At least Alexa has found peace. Bottom line, if one is not internet savvy, they will not much enjoy the Echo Dot. If they know how the internet works, they will enjoy it.Less"
3.0,2 months ago,lowes.com,Recommend to a friend but with some reservations.,"Recommend to a friend but with some reservations. Based on prior experiences with Echo dots. They all use Alexa but they act differently from each other. Maybe part of that is in the app configuring but I can't see it. If app differences are the problem , then I think Amazon should have an option to make all of them have the same features in common. One of my dots has a staticky sound and that is why I bought a replacement recently. Some of the dots if you ask it to play something, it will not play on its own speakers but on some other dot. I'm expected to do a factory reset to correct this but that also require setting up that dot all over again in the app. And the problem returns later. A triple pain. One dot may work but others do not. Some basically say I do not know what I am talking about. Asking it to play something that I have played many times on other dots without a problem. Sometimes to get the dot to play on the dot I am requesting from, I have to specify which dot to play on by name even though it is the one I am speaking to at the moment. They do have a good sound quality but not as good of course as the primary Echo device. I don't know if some of the dot problems are with the dot Itself, but rather with the network setup for multiple dots. Surely this could be corrected and improved.Less"
5.0,a week ago,Currys,Rebecca's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 3rd Gen 2018 Charcoal,Pros: I was so excited for the eco dot arrive as it was a birthday present of the husband. It arrived before the expected delivery date and was packed in loverly box. Opening the box the device was packed very well and neat. The box design is loverly also.Setting up the eco dot was much easier then i thought tuck around 5 minutes connecting to my phone and bluetooth and wifi.The eco dot has great features connecting alarms timers storytime music. My kids love asking alexia can you tell me a joke she has the most chessy jokes but my kids seem to haw with laughter. I have my eco dot set up in kitchen and connected it to the radio so can listen to radio also i have spotify so i cant comment what free music they is on there as it automatically connects spotify. The volume is very loud when turned up the app is very easy to use to connect features to the eco dot. I would recommend the eco dot i was lucky enough to get mine half price but i would pay full price worth money. Cons: I havent got anything to say bad about the eco dot its fantasticLess
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,"Superb value for money, better than home mini","Amazon echo dot 3rd gen is an excellent smart mini speaker for your home. I did lots of research and analysis and picked this one instead of Google home mini. Google home mini has the advantage of much louder sound and volume but except that in every other areas echo dot 3rd gen excels. That does not mean it's sound quality is low. It has excellent bass treble and overall volume to suit your needs. If you have other fire TV, it integrates beautifully. You can use it as external speaker using in built aux audio port. Look and design is awesome. Where it clearly outperform home mini is the proper button checks. Where home mini has an area and relied on your haptic touch to perform an action it has 4 dedicated buttons which is much easier to use. It's blue ring led is very nice to look even at dark, it's amazing. Overall I am satisfied with the purchase.

4.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Outstanding Verbal Control Mechanism,"Originally I was a little skeptical of buying an Echo Dot but made the decision to do so when I automated my swimming pool/spa with a Pentair Intellicenter Control System which boasted it could be verbally controlled. To be honest it required a little bit of a learning curve to get used to the (verbal) syntax required to make everything Alexa friendly to work seamlessly. However, after taking a couple of verbal tries and the Echo Dots (Alexa's) apparent ability to learn as you go along it definitely got easier. And now my wife and I truly enjoy control our smart home items with Alexa thru the Echo Dot. So much so that I bought a third party portable battery so that we can take Alexa outside with us while we are in the pool/spa and totally control the TV/Firestick/Pool/Spa/Music hands free. Bottom line, I should have bought an Echo Dot sooner. The only down side if there is one is that it doesn't come with an internal rechargeable battery for portability. I bought it with an Amazon Firestick combo and got an excellent combo package price!!Less"
5.0,2 weeks ago,Best Buy,Great addition to the Echo range.,"I was an early adopter to the Amazon Alexa products from the beginning. I have at least one over each of the products around the home, creating a complete music, voice controlled, drop-in mesh around the house. Recently I've been upgrading my 1st Gen Dots to these 3rd Gen Dots, due to their better speaker, better sound field and overall nicer aesthetic. The 3rd Gen Dot is 0.6"" larger in diameter than the original dot, and is 0.4"" taller that its 1st Gen brother. The speaker is 0.5"" larger and is 12dB louder. It has an enhanced ability to connect to streaming services, making it a lot more user friendly. Having them in various rooms around the house means you aren't shouting to one central location! (Believe me, I used to do that!). Doing so also allows you to set up multi-room music, and also to 'drop-in' on different rooms in the house, just like an intercom. Great for making announcements (dinner's ready, wake up etc). Overall, very happy with the upgrade to the 3rd Gen model.Less"
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Great product with unexpected features,"I never intended to purchase the Echo Dot and have never had any home automation devices, however it came free with a promo when purchasing my Ring Alarm system. So far, I've been so impressed with this little unit that I purchased another one. It works seamlessly with the Ring Alarm, allowing you to arm and disarm the alarm system by voice. The most impressive (and unexpected) feature of this unit is you can set the Echo Dot/Alexa up to ""guard"" your home when you arm your Ring Alarm system. Once the system is armed, the Echo Dot(s) in your home will listen for the sound of glass breaking, as well as the sound of smoke/carbon monoxide detectors. If it detects any of those events, it will alert you. As far as the internal speaker goes, the quality of sound is reasonably decent for such a small package. It has a line-out jack to connect to external speakers. The only thing that could make this unit better is to add a line-in jack, in the event that you wanted to use it as an external speaker for another device.Less"
4.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Alot better than the previous Dot,"I have both the 2nd generation of the Dot and now the 3rd generation. The 3rd gen improves upon the 2nd in almost every way. The look of the 3rd gen is much nicer than that of the previous model. The cloth and matte finish on the top look far classier than the previous model with its fingerprint prone shiny surfaces. Most importantly, the sound quality has been greatly improved. While this will never rival the larger Echo products in volume or sound quality, compared to last years model, it is night and day different. The audio sounds much more rich and intelligible. Listening to music, radio, or podcasts are much more enjoyable and far less tinny than with the older Dot. For those that have a 2nd gen Dot, I would not upgrade if you don't use it for music, radio, or have it hooked to a stereo or set of speakers. But, if you use it regularly relying on the internal speakers for music, podcasts, etc, I would definitely consider upgrading. Especially if you can get it on one of Amazon's many sales.Less"
4.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Excellent value; decent product,"This was our first Alexa product. I was excited to see what all the hype was about, especially for the low price. It was a great way to get easy, voice-based music into our son's room. As a music player, it's awesome. It integrates well with Apple Music, and is much easier than connecting a phone to a Bluetooth speaker just to listen to music. It makes it a casual, spontaneous thing (instead of an intentional, dedicated activity we're far less likely to engage in). Alexa hears well and the Echo Dot sounds pretty good in a small room. It's nowhere near the sound quality of our HomePod -- but it was a fraction of the price. A few hang-ups, though... First, Alexa is great with general knowledge, but pretty poor when it comes to voice command flexibility. Siri on the HomePod understands conversational English far better (and variations of commands -- read: Siri seems to look for intent rather than a static catchphrase). When we use Alexa Skills designed for kids, it really stands out to me how limited the commands are. If we get them even slightly off, the games break. I should be able to say ""sure"" instead of ""yes"" and have it know that I'm giving an affirmative command. Alexa is also very finicky with smart home accessories. Sometimes she knows which light I want turned on/off and sometimes she has no clue. I wish it plugged into HomeKit. In general, the skills kinda stink. They're gimmicks. That aspect is disappointing. But as a very low cost and pretty good smart speaker for music in our kids room? This thing is great for that.Less"
5.0,7 months ago,ebay.com,Awesome Abilities and Sound,"GREAT DEVICE FOR THE ELDERLY - MOBILITY IMPAIRED - VISION IMPAIRED I have found so many things this device can do. I purchased a set of 4 Jeeo Smart Plugs and Alexa can control them. I have a light on one. Motion Detectors on one. Doors sensors on one and haven't decided what to use the 4th one for. I changed my ""Wake Name"" to ""COMPUTER"" because the only options are Alexa, Echo, Computer and Amazon. To me Computer seems much more personal and non-branded. It is AMAZING what this thing can do. Play music, set alarms, guard house, tell jokes, tell weather, play games, read audio books, the list goes on and on. Another reviewer stated Alexa automatically imported their phones contact list. That is NOT true. You need to pay attention to the setup process. I did not allow my phone to be connected to Alexa and it did not do it. And IF you accidently do you just go to the Device Setting and remove them and turn off the feature. This Device has GREAT BASS for the size. I was really skeptical with the YouTube reviews but I am really pleased with the sound. And connecting it to my cheap 40.00 Bluetooth surround sound was a breeze. I am finding new things daily to do with this device and am looking forward to what is to come with them.Less"
5.0,a month ago,littlewoods.com,Brilliant Smart Speaker,"I bought this as I purchased one for my parents, and was impressed with the quality and features. The sound quality for such a compact device, even at high volume, is outstanding. The Alexa assistant is fantastic. I constantly have a battle to remember upcoming appointments, daily events and health related activities. So far, this has single-handedly been brilliant at reminding me all of these things, allowing me to feel a little less stressed. Music, through Spotify and Amazon music is brilliant. The fact you can also listen to digital radio stations also, is great. If you're bored, why not ask Alexa to play a game. I've currently been competing daily crossword puzzles.

With a simple voice command after the initial setup you can ask what is the weathers like, set timers, alarms, order items from Amazon, and play music to name just a few. If you have smart bulbs, outlets, or thermostats you can control this devices with a simple voice command. My only real complaints about this device is that Alexa is way quieter than the music being played they need to add an option to have separate volume levels for Alexa's voice and music playback Pros: ~Voice Commands with Alexa let you control various smart devices ~Play music from various providers including: Amazon Music, Spotify, Pandora, Sirius and more ~Speaker built in ~ Get Notifications from Alexa when packages are delivered -Make and receive calls with Alexa via paired phone. Cons ~Requires internet to use ~Alexa is quiet vs music playbackLess"
4.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,"Listens well, plays okay","Of the echo devices in our home this one is a convenient size, it listens well, and it produces decent sound. The larger echo device has much better sound and listens about as well, but is more obtrusive and has to be accommodated to project sound for listening enjoyment. The echo ""show"" has the added dimension of ""dropping in"" with a camera so you can see who you are talking to and get visuals, but it is much harder of hearing. I actually got this echo dot to use by our pool to control our ION Bluetooth outdoor speaker (which is also AWESOME!). This gives us the ultra convenient options to control our listening experience without using our wet hands or getting out of the pool to control a device. The dot can access music from Apple or from Prime and change volume, mute, pause and switch playlists or play ad hoc from anywhere within earshot. This device is decent, but what it can do to innovate with technology is the actual power and usefulness. I DO recommend this device.Less"
4.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Best Bang For Your Buck,"If you are getting into the smarthome world, this is should really be your first buy. It has incredible functionality in a small package for a really reasonable price. I was hesitant to buy an echo dot for a couple of reasons at first. The original and 2nd gen. echo dots has horrible horrible sound quality. I mean truly atrocious. I am a bit of an audio snob that prefers Bose products and I promise I know what I am talking about when in comes to sound quality. However! When I heard the 3rd gen. echo dot I was pleasantly surprised. It still isn't fantastic, but it is about 300% better than the old dots. So that sound stuff, moving onto smarthome features. My Echo dots (yes plural, I now own three) control my smarthome and act as a mini-hub for me. I control my bulbs, outlets, and music all from Alexa, which has worked great for the past couple months. I also use Apple HomeKit just in case I want to use my phone to control lights and such but that is just a personal preference. The echo dot 3rd Gen. has so much functionality that I haven't even tapped into yet and am excited to keep exploring. Highly recommend. And for 40 bucks it is pretty much a steal. I also recommend getting 2 of these because the stereo pairing ability is fantastic stuff, I use it all the time.Less"

4.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Improvement over Gen 2,"I have an echo dot (gen 2) and i use them throughout the house for just about everything, being i have a fairly smart home. What I liked about the gen 2 versions, were that they were compact and very flexible on how you could use them. They were easy to mount in different positions and you could really be flexible on how and where you mounted them. The one thing that they really missed on? The well known sound quality. Enter the Gen 3... I really like the improvement in sound. Sure it is not a high quality speaker system, but for the size it is pretty good. Especially when you consider that you can pair them and add a sub for pretty good sound. The look is improved over the gen 2, however it does lose a little bit of the customability that the gen 2 had. With the gen 2, you could purchase different wraps, stands, clock mounts, wall mounts, etc. You could really customize it. The gen 3 is a bit bigger and has a much more rounded shape. it lacks the ability to really customize it. It surely would not work as a power socket mount, like you could do with the gen 2, just due to the additional weight.Less"

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Didn't think I would like it, but I really do!","So I was one of the early adopters of the original Amazon Echo when it first released many years ago. When Iearned about the Echo Dot, I could see why a smaller unit would be desirable (to have more than one around the home), but it seemed silly to me. Furthermore, the original Echo was touted for its strong speakers, so a smaller Dot (to me) would not be able to produce audio quality anywhere close to the original Echo. As a result, I refrained from purchasing the Dot and figured it would benefit those who wouldn't want a larger Echo or wouldn't want to pay a higher price for it. It seemed like the Dots were on sale everywhere from Thanksgiving through Christmas (and beyond). I still wasn't interested, but when Best Buy did a daily deal on a Ring Pro + Chime that also included a free Dot, I bit on the Ring deal (but still wasn't interested in the Dot). However, once I got everything hooked up, my wife wanted to put the Dot in our bedroom for music and to be able to access some of the features we love about the Echo that sits in our kitchen. Plus, where the Dot can be linked to the Ring Pro doorbell, it is nice to be able to have Alexa notify us verbally of a door event. Within moments of getting the Dot set up, my wife was thrilled...and I was impressed. The Dot doesn't produce the power of the original Echo speaker-wise, but the Dot isn't trying to be an Echo. The Dot does, however, produce very good sound--much better, stronger, and clear than I anticipated. For its size, I am pretty amazed. My wife loves the ability to utilize the alarm, timer, and shopping list features (all without needing to head to the kitchen). Plus, learning that the Dot can be linked to the Echo, there is now an ability to get closer to a ""whole home"" speaker system experience. In fact, I purchased a third Dot a few days later for this very option. Add to all of this support for Apple Music (our preferred music provider), which (for us) was a thrilling development. The Dot isn't the unnecessary novelty I figured it would be (although it may still be a novelty). It has become a very happy addition to our home.Less"
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Can be Helpful,"Note: This device was included with another purchase. Still getting used to this Echo Dot and Alexa's abilities. For some reason or another our new LG television won't connect, so having her control any part of the TV is a no go. The TV says it's connected but she doesn't see it. She is responsive though, just be very specific with your commands, questions, etc. Pandora playing through this device is okay as far as sound quality, but when you consider the size of the speaker then it's certainly sounds better than it should. Of course, we have other devices if we want better sound quality/quantity, so Alexa is not a primary source for music. To take full advantage of her abilities you have to have more of a smart home (thermostat, lights and successful connections), which we don't...yet. If you do though, then I could see how this device could be more useful.Less"

The Alexa iOS app and the web application and two of the most crappy applications I have ever used. Apart from the fact that the app cannot discover any of my bluetooth devices, it also has the worst UI ever. Goodluch navigating the horrible UX. Since I cannot connect neither my phone nor my laptop to echo dot, I have no use for it. Returning it ASAP. The fact that Amazon could not program Alexa to recognize special characters in a device's name is SHOCKING because iPhones have been named as ""Matt's iPhone"" since yesteryears.

I was also pleasantly surprised that Alexa not only “understands” your commands without repeating yourself (I love my IPhone but Siri can drive me insane) at all. Plus “she” has character... I know that sounds strange but Alexa definitely is likeable. Whether asking what the weather is going to be tomorrow or playing Classic Rock Music... Alexa is AWESOME!

3.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Trying to See the Utility,I am interested in home automation so I thought I would start with the Dot to begin experimenting. Also picked up a set of smart light bulbs that work with Alexa. The lights in my bedroom which include two ceiling lights and two lamps are all connected to the Alexa so I can turn them on and off with a single voice command which is handy. So far that’s about it. I have the thermostat also connected to Alexa but I find it’s easier to use the Honeywell app on my phone to turn on the AC or make adjustments. The speaker is rather muffled so I don’t use it for music. I may connect it to my stereo to see if it sounds any better. Sometimes I ask for a weather report which is handy. Looking around the house for other potential applications. I’m thinking of a video surveillance system tied into the Alexa but have not researched which cameras would be best. So for now I have a rather expensive light switch that can tell me the weather report.Less

It was always tough getting it to show up on Spotify. (Always had to say, ""Alexa! Spotify connect!"" before it showed up on my device list.) Alexa is far behind my google assistant in terms of understanding spoken word and answering questions. 3 months into ownership, I noticed i had to unplug and re-plug the Dot because it was freezing and shorting out other devices on the power strip it was connected to - after this became too frequent, I yanked the AUX out and started using that. I put the Dot away. 5 Months into ownership, decided i wanted to be able to use my product again, I contacted Amazon telling them about my problem, and they sent me an AC adapter. It attempted to boot, lights came on, and then never came on again. Immediately, I contacted amazon a second time, long story short, I was told the device was out of warranty and there is nothing that can be done. Why did they send me an AC adapter then? I was told I had to purchase a new Echo Dot. No thanks, my money was spent once. This device has a 3 month warranty. 3 months! Watch out for that.

I bought this on a whim, when I saw the offer price. This is an advance on the earlier models, with a less tinny sound when streaming radio, plus you can Bluetooth to it. The microphones are very sensitive, making it easy to use. It was almost too easy to set up a second one on my existing network, leaving me to think I must have missed something out, but it all worked instantly. My only negative comment is that the sound is too heavily biased towards the bass in it's tonal range. Fine if you want to play low quality pop music on it, but for anything else you might want it a bit more sound balanced. Overall, an awful lot of functionality for a small price."

4.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,So far much better than 2nd gen Dot.,"Simply put - I practically hated every waking moment with the 2nd Gen Echo Dot. The mic never worked right, but forget even hearing my voice if there was any music in the background. The speaker was that of an early 2000's cell phone, which I don't use this to listen to music... It just made ""Alexa"" sound tinny and unbearable to listen to for more than 2-3min. The 3rd gen? I gotta say Amazon finally decided to put some real thought into it, bravo. (Even though it looks like a carbon copy of the Google Mini). At least the mic seems on the money each time. The speaker is so much better I don't mind listening to podcasts, etc. on it at all. Somehow the Bluetooth seems to work more efficiently... I've been told that's because it's using different, less error-prone hardware and protocols behind the scenes.

5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Perfect personal assistant for anyone!,"This is my second echo dot purchase....I don't know how I lived without this until now. I'm setting timers,reminders & alarms, making grocery lists, turning on the T.V. and a whole lot more all hands free but it's the simplest way to do hands free! I love it. I put it in the middle of my apartment and Alexa can hear me from almost anywhere. I'm constantly asking her questions and requesting definitions to words I hear in movies or getting her to set timers for cooking and reminders for medicine. I basically have a really intelligent person at my disposal 24/7. I walk everywhere i go and need to know how hot or cold it is outside so when i wake up I automatically say ""Alexa what's the temperature right now"" and she calls it out and tells me the high and low for today as well. I'm loving this.Less"
5.0,8 months ago,ebay.com,Amazing piece of tech,Works perfectly in conjunction. With my echo spot. Has a real quality feel and is also fairly heavy adding to the quality. Has been extremely easy to integrate into our home with all the smart home technology items we have. One thing though is there is an issue with BT home hub and the connections with Alexa. Apparently this is a known settings issue with the solution widely mentioned online. I did call amazon support who were surprisingly quick to respond but I had already resolved the issue before their response. I never though that we would benefit from this but its so clever especially when you set up routines. Its very intuitive and easy to set up speaker quality is surprisingly good considering the units small size. In some ways we have become a bit addicted to adding more peripherals because it is so clever. Highly recommendedLess
5.0,a month ago,bestbuy.ca,The clock made the Echo Dot complete,"I needed a new alarm clock and I have been using the Echo Dot with alarm for two weeks now, and I am loving it. It functions well as an alarm clock. To me, a bedside alarm clock must have two qualities: a dimmable display, and nice tone to wake up with. And this Echo Dot passes with flying colours. The clock display can be dimmed manually or automatically. It also function as a confirmation after you set the alarm time, or ask for weather. That is like icing on the cake. There are many alarm sound to choose from. I particularly like Orca and the Simple Alarm. The increasing volume feature is also very nice. Plus, Alexa is a great digital assistance. I can't think of anything not to like about this product. At that price, it is a steal!"

I never thought I'd want or need an echo dot, so to say I was surprised by how much I love this would be an understatement! The dot was easy to set up and connect with my Amazon account. The sound quality from such a small device is exceptional and I love the features and ability to connect it to my tv and other devices. I was given some smart lightbulbs for Christmas that I've connected with my echo dot; it's been awesome to control the lights in my room with just my voice! It may be lazy, but there is something so nice about being able to turn the lights off without getting out of bed when you're super cozy! I love this so much that I am even thinking of getting another for our kitchen. So happy with this item!Less"
5.0,2 months ago,bestbuy.ca,Welcome improvements over the 2nd Gen,"The Echo Dot [3rd Gen] is nothing new for those who are used to the previous versions of this smart speaker, however, the changes that Amazon has made between generations is noticeable. Sounds are far more robust and well rounded, meaning that as a user I am finding myself using a lower volume setting and yet still getting a good return on the playback. The better quality, due to improved speakers, however, does have a trade-off as this generation of the Echo Dot requires the user to have to use the specific power supply that Amazon shipped with the device, whereas with the Gen 2 model, a user could connect to a powered USB hub and thus have better options for placement of the speaker. Setup in the Alexa app was fairly easy and straight forward. Overall, a well recommended, entry-level item if you are looking into getting into smart speakers and home automation.Less"
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,This is the best Echo dot,"I bought this new Echo Dot with the digital clock on it to replace my generation one echo dot basically because of the clock on it. That was by far the best move by Amazon and the sound quality is very good. When asking Alexa the temperature outside, she also displays the temperature and when you ask here to turn the volume to a number, that shows too. I noticed there’s been some comments on how to make the display brighter. You have to go into your Alexa app and go to your device and you can set the brightness through that feature in the display feature. Now that I have a clock on this Echo Dot, I use it for an alarm now. Also takes up little space on the nightstand and looks great. I’m very pleased with this product."

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Fantastic Promo Item,"We got this as a free item with purchase. It was very easy to setup and operate and our whole family has enjoyed using it. The sound quality is really good and I have been impressed by how far away I can stand and speak in a normal voice and it still hears me (as in telling a child what to say to Alexa kind of far away and Alexa hears me and does what I said so the child doesn’t have to repeat it). When you activate a skill you do have to pay attention to the exact language that you need to use to activate the skill. In terms of smart speakers, I wasn’t necessarily in the market for one because our phones have very good voice activation that really meets that need for us, but since this one was free with purchase, I will say it is nice to have the speaker for our family. Alexa listens to anyone who says her name, whereas my phone only listens to me, that means Alexa can entertain my kids screen free or answer their questions (great for checking math homework and random questions they have that I would normally ask my phone on their behalf). We don’t have any smart devices (besides the doorbell it came with that won’t work with this model because it doesn’t have video), so we haven’t really maximized our use of it yet (I’m thinking a smart plug for the Christmas lights), but we really are enjoying it so far even if it isn’t vital. The thing I most often use it for is playing music when I’m cooking or cleaning. It would make a great gift for the person who has everything but one of these.Less"

The sound can be chosen to represent various rooms and various levels of activity. I can tell it to add things to my shopping list, which I can then view on my phone when I go shopping.

Instead, it sound as though Alexa is speaking to me through a scarf. Richer, perhaps, but also muffled. The bigger problem by far is that the microphone is demonstrably worse. I can stand right in from of this Dot (""Computer"") and giver her commands that she doesn't understand, then issue the exact same command to the gen 2 Dot (""Echo"") at the far end of another room and have her understand me perfectly.

You can stream radio stations. You can get a weather report alth mine keeps giving me the weather for a town about 8 Miles from me. I have tryed changing the weather app to my village but I dont think alexa likes were I live lol. All in all it wa a fun item for a few days then I forgot I had it. Cons: A lot of the questions i ask alexa I get sorry I dont know that. You carnt play music or ask for a specific song unless you pay for it. I think once you have bought one it should be free to stream music especially from Amazon as it is an amazon product that is being sold for amazon. In reality it's more like a glorified remote that can talk to you and answer questions when it wants.Less
4.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Great Smart Speaker for the Price!,"I love all the features I can use on my Echo Dot. I use it specifically more for smart home integration and it works flawlessly! It also is slightly louder than the previous generation which is a great pro. The only negative thing I have to say about this speaker is it’s inability to fully integrate with Apple Music. I use this service for my music and it seems as though Amazon and Apple cant get along enough to benefit the consumer which is the most important thing in my opinion. It will not fully connect at times and when it does you are limited on the features you can perform when compared to other music providers, such as Amazon’s in house music service. Hope they can work something out soon. Other than that I’d say it’s a perfect, great looking speaker!"

5.0,a year ago,Target,You would swear that it is alive,"I bought an Echo dot initially to build a robot jukebox. It's tied into a JBL PRX series professional sound system and the sound quality is devastating. This little disk produces audio that rivals any other source and drives even the subwoofers to their limits. Plus you can subscribe to Amazons 2 million title music service for $4 a month. Why would you ever buy downloads, if any title is available, immediately, on your spoken command? Next step was to have Alexa turn on the audio system. There are numerous gadgets that will work for Alexa - but used Sonoff because they were on sale for $5 each. Amazon provides a server that will turn on or off devices that you give names. Now, one can say, ""turn on speakers"", play ""Betty Davis Eyes"" and Kim KARNES is in the room with you. Then Alexa can adjust the volume, increase the bass and so on. We even found favorite music that was on an 8-track that came with a car and got eaten by the player in the radio decades ago. We could never find that piece of rock, that was by a group in England - not anywhere. Amazon had it just for the asking. Just follow the diagram to set your Echo Dot the same. We gave one to an older relative, and she treats Alexa like a human. Alexa will dial us up, if our older relative needs help. No pendant to wear everywhere, no service to subscribe to - our relative just says Alexa dial our number - and it does. We gave it to a 4-year old, who became enraptured in conversation and the ability to ask it any question - but it wouldn't tell her where babies come from. My wife loses her cell phone in the house several times a day. Alexa just dials it for her and sets the volume to max, to make sure that she can hear the phone ring. My wife's first language was not English, but Alexa tells her how to spell a word, how to pronounce it and even comments on her grammar. Get one of these - you need it - you just don't know that you need it yet.Less"
4.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Worth the upgrade.,"I have owned Amazon Echo products for a very long time now. Before this I had the 2nd gen echo dot and decided to gift that one away and upgrade to this new generation. The good: Sound quality is much improved which I like a lot. Just don’t expect anything crazy from this little speaker. It also looks much nicer now, so it makes for good decor to any home. The bad: I’m still a little annoyed by Amazons speech recognition. I speak as clearly as I possibly can in a quiet room and the Echo still has a hard time understanding what I say sometimes unless I speak a lot slower. Overall it is a great assistant and speaker and I recommend one to anyone looking to get a cheap entry level smart home assistant or is looking to upgrade."
4.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,The next best thing to Siri,"I have an echo dot in almost every room around the house. Once connected to the internet there is almost nothing this smart device can not do. If I leave my iPhone or iPad upstairs I can rely on the echo dot to still turn on and off lights, adjust the thermostat, set the security alarm, add dates, appointments and notes to my synced calendar and notes. I can page people in other rooms instead of healing around the house. It literally connects to almost everything my phone does. Such as Spotify, pandora, amazon, xm radio, even my phone through the Alexa app. It’s a welcomed addition to my apple home. For those that may be skeptical, give a try you’ll like the compatibility and versatility it has with apple and androids."
5.0,a week ago,Best Buy,Great echo dot,"Finally caught this echo dot when Best Buy had them in stock. This is a great addition to any smart home. Works as a nightstand clock and alarm as well. When the light is turned out the display dims so that it isn’t to bright when you are trying to sleep, then brightens up when you turn your light on. It will also display the temperature when you ask Alexa to tell you what the outside temp is. You can also set the alarm so that it goes off on certain days so you don’t have to worry about setting your alarm every evening before bed. Just touch the top for 9 minutes of snooze time. If you can find one I would definitely suggest getting one, well worth it."
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Great Timesaver,"Alexa makes doing many things much easier. Streaming music, checking the weather, monitoring shipments, home automation, and getting information are examples. Alexa does not always understand what you say and has limited abilities but is well worth having. The speaker sounds fairly good for its small size. I purchased an extended warranty because of the Dot's short coverage. Although Amazon claims to record only a few minutes of conversation and only transmit over the Internet when when the light ring is on, users report receiving advertisements shortly after discussing product brands. I leave the microphone on except occasionally when I do not want Amazon hearing what I am saying."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Amazing,"First off, this is not the normal Amazon Echo so the sound is not quite as good, but it is still an amazing device. I upgrade from the 2nd Generation Echo Dot and I am amazed by the improvements. The 3rd gen Dot is worth the price even when not on sale. The sound coming from this little device is amazing for such a compact system. Deeper base than the previous version as well as highs. This is perfect for an office, dorm, or bedroom. It works well in a home kitchen, but I find the full sized Echo to sound better when competing with the sounds of cooking and the overhead range. If you are interest in having an adorable Echo connected to your more expensive sound system, this is a perfect purchase. In addition, the 3rd Generation Echo Dot is capable of connecting to nearly any Bluetooth speaker or headphone. I have personally pared them to my Bluetooth Bose AE2 SoundLink Headphones for a more ""considerate-of-others"" listening experience. I have also connected this Echo Dot to my Bose SoundLink Mini II portable speaker to play music while sitting outside by the firepit. My final thoughts are simply this; ""You Won't Be Disappointed!""Less"
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,The Goldilocks of Echo Products,"Amazon has a plethora of Echo devices, but the Dot, especially the 3rd generation is the one that seems 'just right.' It is small enough to be unobtrusive, but the speaker sound is clear and decent. The fact that it has a 3.5mm stereo output means it can be hardwired to things like your TV's sound bar, or via Bluetooth to portable speakers to create a better stereophonic sound. Alexa seems more mature than Google's Assistant; but you are tied to Amazon rather aggressively. Overall, the Echo Dot has performed better for us than the Google Home Mini we already had; especially when things like simple reminders can quickly be setup while the Google requires some tap dancing, and Goggle's is far less reliable on actually performing those reminders."
2.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Very Disappointing,"The echo dot works fine but ""Alexa"" doesn't.

""Alexa"" could not understand my commands (yet she understood me for the voice training). ""Alexa"" could not understand my husband's commands either and/or the ""skill"" (app) wouldn't work - and he has no speech disability. Even the built-in ""Alexa"" voice on our TVs (we have 2) don't work/respond correctly. Google Assistant is by far easier to use and better at understanding and performing the tasks."
3.0,a month ago,Currys,Steve's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 3rd gen (2018) Sandstone,"Pros: Entertaining when you ask general questions. Can send messages via the app which are read out. Handy when out & about. Plays random songs when asked by your favourite artists. Cons: To play specific songs you need to subscribe to Amazon Prime (2 million songs for £7.99 p/m) or Spotify Premium (millions more songs for £9.99 p/m). You cannot use the free Spotify app to play songs.Google home is better as it does eveything Alexa does, but you can connect Youtube for free. You can request any song you want, if you can put up with the adverts that is. And it works with free Spotify accounts."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Finally,"The older echo dot has been the ugly stepchild of the Amazon Echo lineup. Not because it was particularly bad at what it does best (Virtual assistant) but because of how laughably bad it sounded. The good news was that you could connect a separate speaker using a 3.5mm adapter or Bluetooth but this was cumbersome and unless it was stationary, there was always that one extra step of connecting to it to a speaker that would get annoying. Anyway, out with the old and in with the new. This new echo dot sounds spectacular. Relatively deep bass and not overly punchy but present miss and highs. The volume also loud enough to fill a small room all while being able to hear your commands from accords the room. You still have the 3.5 and Bluetooth option but unless you have a really nice speaker you won’t really need to use those features. The only “ negative” thing I could say about it is the removal of the micro USB port. This was cool for connecting it to the car or a portable charger. There were also several accessories that used that port that will no longer work with the new dot. That being said I love this product. The setup is much easier and the sound alone makes this an easy buy.Less"
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Hit or miss depending on use case,"Personally, I am fairly deeply immersed in the Google Assistant environment. I bought this for my parents, as they have an Amazon Fire TV Stick to stream live TV via Playstation Vue. For that use case, the Echo Dot works great, as you can easily link the Dot to the Fire TV Stick to tune to different channels on PS Vue, watch a certain movie on Prime Video, etc. I also like the Xbox integration, and the speaker's sound quality is pretty impressive on the new generation for how small it is. That being said, the Echo's capabilities can be limited in some areas. For example, shortly after I set the device up, the Dot's light ring began to glow orange. I didn't know what that meant, so I decided to experiment and ask the Echo. ""Sorry, I don't understand"" was the response from the Dot. I asked my Google Home the same question, and it listed what each color of the light ring on the Dot indicated. Sometimes it seems like the Dot can't even return an answer that only requires a simple internet search. The bottom line to me is- if you're integrated into Amazon's ecosystem, or there are specific skills that the Echo can perform that the Google Home devices can't, then I'd recommend the Echo Dot. For most people, I would lean toward the Google Home environment.Less"

Sure it is not a high quality speaker system, but for the size it is pretty good. Especially when you consider that you can pair them and add a sub for pretty good sound. The look is improved over the gen 2, however it does lose a little bit of the customability that the gen 2 had. With the gen 2, you could purchase different wraps, stands, clock mounts, wall mounts, etc. You could really customize it. The gen 3 is a bit bigger and has a much more rounded shape. While it makes it look better by itself, it lacks the ability to really customize it. It surely would not work as a power socket mount, like you could do with the gen 2, just due to the additional weight.That is before you get to the horrendous power cord and adapter. The power adapter is twice as big as the gen 2 and the power cord went away from the, easy to find, usb style cord to a old style input style and it is permanently attached to the power adapter.

4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,A great starter smart home device,"Not sure what to say about the Dots at this point, they've been around for awhile. I will say this was my first 3rd gen Dot, and you can definitely tell a difference. The addition of the fabric cover makes it feel like a more upscale product. I also feel like the sound quality is a bit better than the 2nd gen, but that's not saying much. It's still nothing to write home about. Another difference is in the plug-in. My 2nd gen Dots came with what was essentially a wall adapter (like you'd get with a cell phone or tablet) with a micro-USB cable. This has been changed to a more traditional ""wall wart"" type plug for the 3rd gen."
4.0,10 months ago,cdw.com,3rd Generation Echo Dot - an easy to use winner,"I recently got the Echo Dot. Setup was a breeze, the instructions were pretty simple and intuitive. The device works with other items I already had in my home such as a Bluetooth sound bar and a Honeywell programmable thermostat (despite the fact that Amazon seems to prefer Nest products). When we are watching shows or listening to music streaming through our Firestick the dot will follow voice commands which is nicer than constantly picking up the remote. It will also tell jokes, sing, tell the weather, set up a timer, etc. And for those who are concerned that the device can listen in on you, there is a button on top that turns off the microphone. Thus far this has been a nice addition to our home."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Great considering it was free, but would I buy it?","The answer is... It depends. I got this for free after purchasing a Blink XT camera and Alexa is, well, nifty. The concept of the Echo Dot to me originally came off as a novelty for people who wanted to be TeChY and tReNdY, but after having the device for a couple weeks, I see some utility to it. But also some issues. First off, the voice recognition is maybe a tad superior compared to Google and looks like a genius compared to Siri (I have Android, my fianceé has Apple. We... Have settled our differences). Asking questions while studying without having to reach for my phone feels ~oh so good~ and setting reminders, alarms, and... Well, that's pretty much all I've done so far. Because, well, the issues... The setup tutorial tells you how to connect your phone properly to the Alexa app. There's a problem, though... The directions don't match the interface. ""Scroll to the bottom of the home page and select settings then..."" but the home page only has tooltips for teaching Alexa things, and nothing in the settings has revealed much luck either. Which is a shame, because I'd love to have an easier way to send texts while cooking/cleaning/studying, etc. The other downside is more or less a fault of my own, though: I don't really NEED this. I don't have smart devices throughout my home like an advanced security system. I could upgrade my existing one, but the one I have works, and there's little benefit to be had. I could install smart light bulbs or even outlets, but the technology is still fairly new and the benefits of minor convenience wouldn't warrant the entry costs. So where does that leave me at the end of the day? Well, if you're a tech savvy person with multiple smart devices and home systems and have some disposable income to get everything connected, then I wish you the best in your endeavours and recommend you get this! The build quality is robust, the speaker is adequate, the microphone will pick your voice up from the next room, and the accuracy is great. But if you don't have the time/money/know-how, then perhaps you can still buy it if you can get it for a reasonable price. It is neat to have, and if you can get it fully connected to your phone, it's a great little assistant.Less"

Makes reading in bed way better because I can yell at Alexa to turn off the lights when I'm done reading. With a few extra things (smart plugs, IR Control Hub) Alexa can also control the TV and other stuff. She's good for alarms, shopping lists, reminders, timers, jokes, and even home security - she can bark like a dog when she hears people (requires a certain skill). She can do thousands of other things, but this is what I've got my Alexa doing. She's great if you're single too! Makes it feel like there's a woman in the house."
5.0,4 months ago,Target,Get one! Or two or three!,Great device. The sound quality is incredible. I have grown tired of listening to music out of my phone’s speaker. Music and podcasts sound incredible. Voice quality on a phone call is good on the dot end but just ok on the phone end. You pick up all the ambient noise. Love all the “skills” it has! Being able to add items to my grocery list by telling Alexa from the kitchen is great! And the “guard mode” is great. Won’t replace a security system but an awesome feature nonetheless. If you have Apple Music you do not need to subscribe to Amazon Music. You can set your default music setting to Apple Music by linking the account in the Alexa App. So much more to list but you get the point. I got it on sale and can not wait to get more throughout the house!

We already had a fully built Sonos system through our house, so we don’t use the built in speaker for music listening, but it’s amazing how these little devices make our lives so much easier. Alexa can play music on our Sonos devices, adjust the thermostat, turn the lights on and off, and a lot more. We have one in our kids room and love the FreeTime feature that reads stories and plays simple games with our son. And you can’t beat the price. Even bought one as a gift for my mother-in-law and she loves it in her little condo. Highly recommend."

5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Good Improvement from last Gen,"First off the Clock is way useful. It transforms the Echo Dot to something that can be the center piece on the mantle or entertainment center rather than just another piece of clutter. Amazon has also improved the AI; basically if you can think it, Alexa can most likely do it. For example, I asked Alexa play ""relaxing jazz"" and she understood and immediately enabled a skill that had played smooth jazz on a loop. Alexa is able to find the latest episode of most mainstream podcasts. My favorite was when I asked Alexa to ""dim the lights and change the color"" and she was able to do it. It is basically like being on the Enterprise now."

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Makes us Lazy,"We have enough items in our house to make buying an Alexa device practical. I have connected the following to our Alexa app: 1. Our car - remote lock and remote start by asking Alexa. 2. Our Roomba 3. Several TP-Link plugs 4. Our NEST thermostat 5. Our Ring security system You can also link it to apps that manage calendars and grocery lists. Therefore you can add to a list just by asking Alexa to do so when you think of it so you don't have to write it down. Oe of the main decisions I had to make was which version of the speaker do I need for listening to music? I considered the $400 Bose speaker but didn't want to spend that much. Then there is is the $180 Sonos speaker but you need 2 for stereo. But, here is the great part - this Dot will connect to my Bose mini soudlink that I already have giving me fantastic sound. I highly recommend going this route rather than buying an expensive speaker with Alexa built-in. If it is also important to have a screen then there is the Spot or Show for that. However, the Echo Dot understands me even when the TV is loud and performs whatever skill I ask of it. I decided on the Dot rather than the Google Mini simply because I am already an Amazon Prime member and have a Fire TV.Less"

They are basically meant for whole home voice control in my opinion. One main problem I have had with these is when playing a game like song quiz. For some reason the speaker will just cut out right in the middle of a game and this has happened multiple times. I tested this on other echo dots and it does the same thing. I also tested it on my third gen echos and it does the same thing on those as well. The only one it does not do it on is my single echo plus.

1.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Buggy, Muffled voice and not enough mics","I had high hopes for the 3rd Gen Echo dot. I put mine in my Master bedroom, behind a table lamp (That is what I did with my previous echo dot (2nd Gen) and the Google home mini). I assumed this will work fine. But most times, the echo dot will not even respond. Either the mics on these are very low sensitivity or not enough. Now I have to keep the echo dot in line of sight to have any reasonable response. Even then I see 1 out of 5 wake words being ignored. Also, when there is a song or audio already playing on the echo, the wake word response is very low probability unless you are really loud. The sound was extremely muffled with high bass and much lower treble settings. This meant every time Alexa managed to respond to me, I had trouble making out the speech and tell her ""I did not understand that"" :). But those audio changes make the echo an awesome music playback device. There seems to be some form of software auto volume leveling going on, that is very unreliable. There were random change in the volume which was annoying at times. My biggest problem with the 3rd gen Echo dot was its lack of consistency with recognizing what I said. Most command recognition was almost a roll of dice. But the major reason I returned the echo dot, was the power supply design. This was bad design. Amazon decided to make their power adapter a non standard connector. This meant I cant use the tons of USB output power regulators, I have lying around in my house. Also in the age of USB type C, Amazon went a step back on their design. The reason maybe for them to avoid the use of non standard power supplies. But then that is a design flaw that they cant limit current drawn. The software app interface and set up was also a cumbersome process. This has been my qualm about amazon in general compared to their competition who seems to be picking up very fast.Less"

It isn't terribly bigger than a hockey puck, but the sound it produces is pretty impressive. The size of this speaker really works to it's advantage. It won't get knocked over, it is very discreet to a point that you usually don't even notice it's there, until you start up the music. Of course, since this is a smaller speaker, you are not going to get the bass impact like you do from it's big brother the Echo. However, when you have a Dot paired with an Echo, they compliment each other quite nicely. The price point on this device is great. I was able to pick a couple of the Dots up during the Holidays for $25 a piece and for that price these are a steal!!! Even at the regular price of $49, you are getting a quality speaker with enough functionality through the Alexa app to make it a worth while purchase. If heavier bass and volume are your thing, then go with the bigger Echo, otherwise, you can't go wrong with the Dot if you are looking for a way to break into the world of Alexa.

Everything was easy including setup and use. The only drawback which I mentioned in my other review is that Alexa only allows you to link 1 Spotify account. And because of this limitation, you can only play music from one Spotify account at any single point in time. For example, if my wife plays music from the echo dot in the kitchen via Spotify, I cannot play music from Spotify on another echo at a different part of the house. I also cannot play Spotify from my phone without terminating the earlier playback since Spotify only allows you to play at a single source at any given point in time. If Alexa can allow multiple Spotify accounts (which many of us do with the family plan), this will be a 5 star rating! I ended up setting up this echo dot under my son's Alexa account which allows him to link this to his Spotify account. However, this means that this echo dot is in a separate set up as my other echo dots.Less"
1.0,a year ago,Best Buy,A headache,"I was initially very excited to receive my echo dot and thought I got a great deal for it. Upon its arrival I was impressed by its look. Once I began setting it up in my college dorm it gave me a headache since the Alexa App runs so slow. Then, things got worse when I tried connecting my echo dot to the WiFi. This product is not university WiFi friendly, I had to use my cellphone’s hotspot to set it up. Well after 15 minutes I finally got it running. I decided to link my Spotify account to it and it worked very well, the sound quality was pretty good for its size. After 8 minutes of listening to music Alexa decided to run an update without permission, completely disrupting my music. I waited about 10 minutes and decided to give it a shot to get it running again, but Alexa kept saying “I’m sorry, I’m having trouble understanding you. Please try later.” I unplugged it and plugged it back in again but I had the same response from Alexa. I am surely returning this product ASAP because I am truly disappointed in the efficiency of the Alexa App and the user friendliness of both the app and echo dot. I hate having no control over what the “smart” speaker does. It truly felt like Alexa was in control all the time. I do not recommend this product to anyone.Less"
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Good upgrade to original Dot (for some things..),"My quick and to the point review for this 3rd Generation Echo Dot is pretty simple, the audio is VASTLY improved over the original Echo Dot. To say the original Echo Dot audio was ""utilitarian"" was being kind. However, performance wise in terms of responsiveness and just getting it booted up, it's a bit slower. The microphone is also seemingly less sensitive somehow? I have no audio testing equipment so I can't pinpoint why this would be, but my perception is that it's not as good as the original Dot or even the First Generation ""Pringles Can"" sized Echo device. Aside from all those minor complaints, this is an improvement in terms of sound quality and aesthetics. Cheers!"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,My own virtual assistant.,"I have always heard others speak on this which made me inquisitive on purchasing. Ive heard all the news stories on being cautious with this device for varying reasons. However, with all things there is a way to protect your things. I received this when I purchased my tv. I must say, I actually enjoy it. It is super interactive, you can use the alexa app to set up your preferences, schedule. You can also speak to the device to get your news briefings, reminders, traffic updates and things like that. You can also set it up to interact with the fire tv. I could go on about the things it can do but if I did, this would be a very long review. I will recommend this.... You will not be disappointed!!"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Best investment,"I purchased 2 Echo Dots when it was on sale, even after reading mixed reviews about them. The setup was very simple. I placed one in the bedroom and another in the living room. I setup the skills I wanted and that was the only time consuming thing as I had to see which ones we would use the most. Once setup, it was very easy to use. The only thing ""issue"" we ran into is when playing music. Some radio stations use different skills and although you say the radio station name, there can be multiple. So we have to use the radio stations' call name like WPGC, WKYS, etc. Once you use it a few times, it stores the names on the Alexa app. I've had the echo's play a radio station feed for hours. It never turns off on us unless the radio station stops the feed (has happened to 1 particular station). Once in the app, I can control the volume, location of stream (bedroom or living room) without any issues from wherever I am. I do not have to be on the same network to get it to work. I also synced my phone to the Echos so that I an use that as a speaker instead of my phone if I needed to. Best part is that these Echo's have great volume to it. It goes from 0-10 and I usually keep it at 3 or 4 and it's loud enough for me. If you have a party with a lot of people, you can increase the volume to a comfortable level and still hear it just fine. I also use the Bluelink skill to remote start my SUV in the mornings so I don't have to use the Bluelink app. This comes in handy when I'm doing things in the morning. I'd purchase more if needed. Well worth the investment.Less"

She loves getting the weather forecasts and answers to her questions about movies that she is watching. I purchased some smart switches and light bulbs that I am going to install for her in the near future. Although she isn't tech savvy enough to set it up, she loves what it is capable of doing for her. It is even great when we drop in on her device and can converse with her and my brother in law. We have 2 if them and control most of our smart home with them. It just goes to show you how technology can work regardless of your age."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Hey Alexa!,"This one was a last minute gift for my teenage niece. I had bought several due to a really good price. My son and I enjoy asking Alexa different questions some of the responses are quite comical. You can have this devices learn skills through an easy to use app. It does get good volume. If your buying strictly for listening to music it's not bad, volume doesn't go that high in my opinion and the bass is almost non existent. If your looking for a wireless rechargable device than this is definitely not the one your looking for. It has to be plugged into a wall for power."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Neat Echo Dot,"My son introduced me to how the Echo Dot worked by having it turn on our Christmas tree by voice commands. Seemed pretty neat. As a result, I ordered 2 surge protectors which had outlets and USB ports that are voice controlled. By installing one of these next to my recliner, I can turn two lights on/off, two computer chargers on/off, and the four USB ports on/off. Since my den does not have an overhead light, is somewhat dark and the light switches are inconvenient, the Echo Dot make it easy to turn on lights when I enter the room or turn off when leaving. Especially nice when I have something in my hands. And it was easy to set up!"
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Alexa gets even better,"In our effort to 'cut the cable' we chose to upgrade an expand our Amazon horizons. That is how we found this bundle deal. We saved about half by the total price and got a Fire TV Stick and this 3rd Gen Echo Dot. I tried to give a solemn goodbye to the old Gen 1 Alexa but she was still too dumb to understand. Since the easiest install ever, I turned it on and it told me to open my mobile Alexa app and show it my wifi. Then magically it was set up! I am on a Trial Prime Music (3 months) that got me another 3rd Gen Alexa and thousands of my favorite songs for under 10 bucks, I discovered I can play music to all my Dots at once! Very happy with my Best Buy purchase."
5.0,a month ago,lowes.com,My 89 y.o. Mother is having so much fun with it!,"I was nervous about this product as being difficult to set-up and use. Not at all! Just download the app to your smartphone and it walks you through it quickly. My mother is 89 years old and always seemed to hate computers. She is having a BALL with this thing. The sound is incredible. The lightning-fast response to questions is mind-boggling. She can ask Alexa to play a song from HER era, and it plays almost instantly. I have ordered 2 more, one for the kitchen and one for her bedroom since she has a hard time setting her alarm clock. She only has to say ""Alexa, set an alarm for 8:00 AM"". Extremely happy with this purchase. I'm holding out on getting my own until Amazon can provide a male voice."
4.0,3 weeks ago,Best Buy,Does exactly what it says it does,"Since I don't have a smart house this is really more of a novelty than anything else. Still, at this price you can't really go wrong. The only thing I don't like is that you can't change the Alexa voice. You can change her accent but that's all. I'm sure that will change soon but for now you're stuck with no voice options. It seems like such a simple thing. Word of caution: When you search for the app online don't let your browser redirect you to a third party. Mine did and I was instructed to call an 800 number. Then the guy told me Echo wouldn't work on my wifi until I installed some other products at a cost. I finally figured out I wasn't dealing with Amazon Echo."
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Excellent product to assist around the house,"Can't say how many times Alexa has ""reminded"" me of little things on my schedule while busy, told me a daily joke to keep my smile going or quickly helped me get my shopping cart in order to keep the pantries stocked for specific dietary needs. Like any tech of this type... the more you use it the easier it becomes. However, DO NOT USE this with your Security system. I have heard horror stories... well... not quite ""horror"", but ""stupid"" stories. Alexa is meant to be flexible for users and while you can create a voice profile, that does not prevent anyone else from accessing your house, etc. Maybe in a future software upgrade, but for now... just use it for common, daily stuff around the house."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Very high quality product,"I was hesitant at the beginning because I'm from Mexico and my accent is strong, I thought I was going to have problems with Alexa understanding me. I'm very happy to have found out that the AI is really good, it understands me quite well and I haven't had any problems with it. It also has surprisingly good sound for its size, very loud, clear, and quality sound overall. It's not a thousand dollar bose sound but very nice for the size and type of product. Very useful to control home automation devices that it is what I use the most. You can link it very easily to Samsung Smartthings that it's my setup."
1.0,7 months ago,John Lewis,Faulty & Cheap Quality,"I bought 5 echo dots in Feb this year and 1 echo plus - they seemed great and perfect for what we wanted BUT within 3 months one of the dots started to make a constant hissing / static noise, even when no audio is being played! In the last month ALL the dots are now making the same constant noise! Contacted Amazon & John Lewis - John Lewis technical support have not bothered to respond after 3 weeks. Amazon state they are faulty but will only replace with refurbished dots. Not good! If you read forums as well incl. Amazon, its a wide issue. The echo plus is great, the dots are cheap and seem to be widespread faulty - avoid (also the sounds not great on them)!"

I bought this for my 89-year-old mother who lives alone and refuses to learn how to use a computer. It took a little while to get her comfortable with it, but now she can ask it for the day, time of day, day of the week, etc. She loves music and can quickly get to a station with all her favorite genres. The sound quality is astounding for the size of it. The only downside I found is that all smart switches for lights and so on have to be 2.4 GHz. Her WIFI is 5 GHz. so none of them will work. I guess that's not really a negative for this device, just the manufacturers of smart add-ons."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Good but depends on other smart devices owned,"The echo dot is great. It has good speakers. But how good and useful it can be depends on other smart devices owned. For example, we do not have the Fire Tv by Amazon but use Roku. So, I cannot connect the TV directly to Roku and ask the Echo dot to play from Netflix. I need an app to do that, which is kind of annoying. Similarly, I have YouTube premium and I cannot use Echo dot to ask it to play from YouTube. So, if you have amazon prime and Fire Tv, echo dot can be very useful. Otherwise, you will have to find other (less-useful) hacks to use it efficiently."
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Excellent addition to smart home!,"Control various devices just by asking Alexa! And gives you information quickly and efficiently. It's a gadget you dont know you need until you don't have it! Simple home automation with select and additional devices (smart hubs). On the privacy issue... well you're either on board or your not. So if you're reading the reviews just get it! You wont be disappointed. If you dont want it to listen to a conversation it has a mute button which disables the microphone and lets you know it's on mute with a red ring light. Or just unplug it! Sound is good too for such a small speaker, bluetooth enabled."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,So much more than music and weather,"I love the deeper volume/bass the 3rd gen has over the first gen.

Linking to smart bulbs, smart light switches and smart power outlets makes ""The Clapper"" a thing of the past. Turning your TV off/on, volume contol, fireTV stick contol, no problem! My favorite (most used) feature is the DROP IN feature. I have a 3 story house and it is a pain to walk down 2 flights of stairs from my office to ask a simple question on 1st floor then go back upstairs. You can link 2 echo dots together and say ""Alexa, drop in on kitchen"" and the Echo Dots will link together like a wireless intercom. If you only have one Echo Dot, you can use a mobile device with the Alexa app from anywhere in the world to ""drop in"" on your echo dot. It can also be used as a hands free speaker phone to dial out even when your mobile device is not present. It will establish a VoIP call and your mobile number will be displayed on the device that you are calling.Less"

3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Slower than 2nd gen, no USB","This is the 4th product I've owned with Alexa voice control. It looks nice and has a deeper sound than the 2nd generation, but has 2 flaws that I cannot overlook. First, this 3rd generation Echo Dot is slower to respond to the wake word ""Alexa"" than the 2nd generation. The 2nd generation is almost instant, this one takes almost a full second. I tested both of them in the same location with one disconnected while I tested the other to avoid conflict. Second, this 3rd generation does not have a micro USB port on the back for power, it used a barrel connector which means you are going to be left with a useless brick if you ever damage the included cable. The 2nd generation uses the standard micro USB. I do not recommend this new version of the Echo Dot over the 2nd generation. Buy a 2nd generation if you can find one or wait to see if Amazon fixes these problems with the 4th generation. They usually announce new products in early Spring.Less"

Return the Echo Input for the Echo Dot (3rd Gen) because the Echo Input only has one blue LED light on the surface top center to let you know that its listening, very hard to see this small LED blue light. The Echo Dot (3rd Gen) has a full blue ring around the surface top. This blue ring can be seen easily from across the room; so much nicer. The 3rd Gen is worth the few extra buck."

I want to know how to work various robots and stuff so I'll keep trying. Giving commands all the time seems like a lot of yap. I don't like talking to robots. I like quiet...except for when I listen to my MUSIC! That's probably where I'll get the most use and enjoyment out of it. I hear it's a lot of fun with music.

I have never had any issues with this device recognizing my questions its always accurate and knows exactly what I am asking it. The one issue I have with it is unless you are a techy person you may never use it to its full potential because you may never really pick up on just how the ""Skills"" as Amazon calls them work. Basically you have to download an Alexa app on your phone and then setup the device but from there you have to download skills to really take advantage of this device, an example would be I downloaded a Fios Skill so that I am able to control my cable box with commands such as ""Alexa watch AMC on Fios"" The problem is setting up the skills for this to work I had to enable the Fios TV skill then I had to choose what cable box this device was going to control, well if you never named your cable boxes by the rooms they are in then you have to figure out the name the cable company gave your cable box. Anyways like I said once you get everything figured out its great. I have it tied to my calendar in Outlook, my cable box, my Fire TV, I use it to play music from Amazon ""Apple Music is coming to this device soon"" I ask it what my commute to work is like, what's the Weather today. As far as the Sound quality goes, this small device is perfect for a bedroom or office if you want good sound in a bigger room buy the ECHO or ECHO Plus its that simple.Less"

But my mother told me this was the best thing anyone gotten her, I told her what I use my for and she said that would come in handy. She uses it when her TV goes off air due to the weather, she knows to ask for the current weather in her area. Also there are times that she wants to spell a word an had to look it up in the dictionary and she can not see the small print due to her eye site. I showed her how to ask Alexa, she loves that and I showed her how to use it as a reminder. Best present ever, that makes me happy knowing that it can help her.

I have a mini Alexa! The speaker is decent for music for my purposes. It's small, compact and easy to hide in a room. Nobody even knows I have it until I talk to it and I'm a minimalist neat freak so I don't want cords and devices all over the place. I totally love the features that allow you to just add things to your to do list and shopping lists by talking out loud where the device can hear you. I would buy one for just that feature in fact. I love that my lists show up on my phone automatically and my shopping list also shows up in my Amazon Prime lists. It makes it so easy to never forget things. I also love the search feature that allows you to just ask a question like... ""how long do hummingbirds live?"" Alexa came right back with the answer. For those who think it's silly that I even mention this, there really are those of us out here who have no clue about these ""smart devices"" except that they make us feel intimidated and dumb! Well this is one I'm willing to support because at it's core there are very practical and handy things it does that make my life simpler! I'm all for that!Less"

The gen 3 is way better for playing music but is difficult to hear in large rooms. You can fine tune the EQ settings to get a better sound however, it will be at the sacrifice of good EQ for music. It would be nice if there was a way to program this dot to use different EQ settings for music than for voice control. Other than that it works great. The commands are processed quickly and the speaker is way better for music playback than the gen 2."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Cool Device but edged out a bit by the Google Mini,"The Amazon Echo (3rd Gen) is a cool device to own and use. It can do fun things that the Google Mini is not seemingly readily equipped for yet. Like the Mini, these smart devices are constantly learning and their expandability is quite immense. I like how a free app may be downloaded into one's mobile device that allows a user to customize Alexa. Since I'm an Android / Google fan, I find that the Google Mini edges out the Echo Dot in the sense that it is easier to make sense of how Google Mini works and how it may be linked to other Android / Google-based devices such as the Google Chrome. Overall, buying either device will be pleasing if you want to own a smart speaker. Just beware that owning / using a smart speaker may also be compromising your privacy a bit given their open microphones. Fortunately, these mics may be manually shut off easily by a switch located outside of each of the two devices.Less"

Unfortunately, it isn't very consistent in hearing us. When we first set it up, it worked great. Maybe an update screwed something up, but a few months after first setup, it wouldn't hear us fairly often. As a speaker, it sounds pretty good. Bass is the biggest improvement, along with considerably more volume. At Max volume it does distort slightly, but back off the volume a touch and it'll clean up. Gets plenty loud while still clean."

Plus since they can send commands to other Echo/Alexa devices among other things you can turn them into an intercom system for you Echo/Alexa enabled home. Imagine being in the kitchen and you just put dinner on the table. Rather then having to chase everyone down to come to dinner you can just stay in the kitchen or wherever one of you Echo control devices are and call everyone to dinner. Their main improvement in the latest generation (3rd Generation) was the addition of several microphones (making it more responsive) and an improve speaker for better sound playback quality. This means they can also serve as a radio or a news source. Its not high fidelity but given its size the sound quality is pretty nice.

Believe me it can be educational for us all. I love that I can use it as a speaker or take it with us if when we travel. Around the home it can be placed anywhere that a power source is available. Used often & really a great item to have around. Awesome quality & fits in with the decor, it also blends in so we'll most people do not even notice it unless I have the mic turned off. That red ring is obvious... Easy to connect, use & a helper to our family... Another great buy at Best Buy..."

I went to 8 different stores. So many of the stores sold the Echo Dot but none of them sold the cord by itself. after searching for hours I went back home. I was about to give up and just spend double what I paid for and order a new cord online. I looked around my house one last time and then found a compatible cord in the cabinet over my stove. It was the wrong amps and volts but I tried it anyway and it worked out. Wish I would have found it before I waisted my gas and time.

The sound quality is exceptional for such a compact device (and, as the owner of a home recording studio, I'm extremely picky about these kinds of things). Plus, the convenience is outstanding. It is unobtrusive and fun to use. Ours lives in the kitchen, central to the house, but we unplug and take it with us to the outdoor spaces when we're hanging out on the deck. I'd recommend it to anyone who has wi-fi and doesn't have a home device like this yet. The price point is perfect and the quality and value are outstanding."

It reminds me about doctor appointments, free trials ending, when payments need to be made, when to take dinner out of the oven, and is my morning wake up alarm. I even have music hooked up, and love that. My only complaint is that the warranty is only 90 days long. Amazon's electronics all seem to have this very brief warranty. Odd & annoying. They sell the kind of electronic products that generally come with a 1 year warranty. So I'd strongly suggest getting an extended warranty with it."

I must admit I wouldn’t have bought this if I hadn’t gotten it for free. But now... this Echo Dot can do so much. So many voice commands to connect to my thermostat ring video doorbell etc. I must say I’m in love. It can get pretty loud too. But the sound quality is not even close by more than half to my Homepod. But this little dot packs a punch and does more than I ever imagined it would. So if your looking to purchase you won’t be disappointed. You need to download the app on your phone and connect it to your devices. But after that it’s one of the best

I received an email about this product on sale Xmas Eve, I was going to give my teenage nieces money but opted to purchase these for them instead. One is hard to please the other was very excited about it. My only gripe with this speaker is the fact that it requires it to be plugged into the wall, I mean this day and age seriously. Not a huge concern I guess if you were planning on making a nice setup in your home were you have several of these linked together. They have a nice weight to them, grip on the bottom and the speakers aren't bad. It doesn't have the best bass to it but overall for what it is it isn't bad."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Inexpensive and better than the 2nd generation,"The third generation Echo Dot has much better sound than the 2nd generation. It is good enough and loud enough that I can listen to most music without connecting to an external speaker. I have 2 2nd generation devices and 2 3rd generation devices. Each are connected to my TV through TIVO and my Ecobee thermostat. Both 2nd and 3rd generation seem to have the same software. They are OK but often get the commands wrong, and you have to pick the right words. For example, if I ask Alexa to change the channel it will change my TV channel through TIVO. If I ask Alexa to change the station, it will pick some Amazon or other station. Also it will sometimes tell me that it cannot find TIVO or Ecobee depending on the words that I use when asking. The bottom line is that I like the Echo Dot 3rd generation especially for the $25 that I paid for it and an Amazon smart plug.Less"
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Great value for the cost,"I wanted to add Alexa to my house - I had one of the original Echo Dots and used it sparingly. I'll admit that I wasn't nuts about the always-on listening device. But I took a stab and ordered one of these and am very pleased with the purchase. The sound quality is much better than the first generation, and it definitely meets my requirement to play podcasts and have them sound ""not tinny"". The fact that Alexa can integrate a skill that links to Apple music is a definitely plus too. Bottom line, if you don't mind (or can get over) the constant ""listening in"" and are a member of the Amazon ecosystem, this is a great device for the cost."

I enjoy all of the useful tasks that it can perform: setting alarms, making phone calls, playing music, etc. I especially like the ""drop in"" function that allows me to talk to the people in separate rooms in my house. One thing that I dislike about it is that it often misreads what someone says if they do not talk directly at the microphone. Even speaking from the side sometimes leads to the device hearing the wrong thing. The biggest thing that irritates me about the device is setting it up. The app is particularly frustrating because the confirmation code has to be sent to the phone, but sometimes will crash the app, sending the user to the beginning of the process all over again (It could also be because I have an Android phone). Both devices that I set up crashed the app nearly ten times each. Once the device is set up, the device works great. I would still recommend the device. I give it a solid 4/5.Less"

1.0,8 months ago,John Lewis,Fantastic and Terrible,Fantastic little device and it would get five stars if it was not for one extremely aggravating issue that cannot be resolved. When you ask it to play a song through Amazon Music ( with prime subscription ) if its not in your play list or available on Amazon Music it starts playing a long Amazon advertisement to induce you to subscribe to Amazons Unlimited service and there is absolutely no way or turning this most aggravating unsolicited advertising off either though your Echo account or through Amazon itself. It had become so frequent and annoying that I very rarely use it for music and that's the main purpose I purchased it for so I have given it to my mum to use as a radio and some music occasionally as she is a lot more tolerant of this annoying glitch than me. I defiantly would not recommend unless you are happy to pay nearly £10 a month extra to have Amazons unlimited service and that's on top of the price for your Prime subscription but I just use Amazon Music through my Fire Stick as this just plays the available songs without the constant prompting to sign-up to Unlimited.Less

5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Really impressed it works so well and is so simple to use,I got this as a present for my niece so had to set it up in advance. Im pretty tech savy but to be honest it was a joke how simple this was and how easy it was to link up other accounts like prime or spotify. Voice recognition used to be very patchy in things and you always had to ask things in a very specific way. All of that is no longer an issue. After connecting it to my wifi via the app I didn't bother with the instructions i just started asking it to do things straight away like play a certain song make it louder etc. I then asked it the time with the music playing. The music stopped time was given music continued. I really love this device. I was going to get prime unlimited till i saw it was another 8 then i found online if you only use it with the speaker its 4 so then i bought my step dad one and im getting one next. For me the main feature is to create a playlist and add songs on the fly then later look online and look at the list to decide what music to buy. This is going to seriously increase my music collectionLess

4.0,3 months ago,ebay.com,Fun toy that's actually useful.,"I like the ""echo"" it's a bit of fun and sometimes even quite useful, I'm still learning new things about it. It was difficult to set up, it asks you questions to get to know your voice, but it kept stopping halfway through a question, then stopping altogether, took some time for this to work properly, it wasn't a slow internet connection causing the problem, I have a very reliable & fast connection. But once past that it seems to be working fine. The quality of the music is very good for something so small, I don't like that you cannot ask it to play specific songs without signing up & paying 4 a month. But all in all, I like it."

Compact and unassuming in design, it is excellent value for money, packed full of fun and useful features. It also offers surprisingly good quality sound considering it only has a small speaker. My father-in-law especially loves how you can use the Echo Dot via Alexa to call someone hands free without the need to use your mobile.

I have important phone calls coming in so if I'm in the shower all I gotta say is alexa answer and wallah! The call is through.

Now comes in a subtle ivory (charcoal and mid grey also an option) which looks good in the bedroom and doesn’t look out of place. The styling greatly improved with softer curves but slightly larger than the original. The biggest improvement is with the sound and sounds more natural and quite a bit louder. Liked the new one so much bought another for the lounge where I can hook it up to my surround sound system if required.

Well, I bought my first Echo Dot a week and a half ago. It has been so empowering for me to not struggle over to turn on lights. It also allows me to turn lights on or off from bed. Now I have 8 echo dots all around the hose. I couldn’t have had better timing. Black Friday deals meant this either came with an outlet included or just $22 for each additional dot. This has been incredibly helpful to keep me independent and safe."

Setting up was easy and syncing with the other smart home devices around the house was seamless too. The only drawback with Alexa is the ability to link up with different Spotify accounts (it can only be linked to one) and because of this limitation, you can only play music from one Spotify account at any single point in time. For example, if my wife plays music from the echo dot in the kitchen via Spotify, I cannot play music from Spotify on another echo at a different part of the house. I also cannot play Spotify from my phone without terminating the earlier playback since Spotify only allows you to play at a single source at any given point in time. If Alexa can allow multiple Spotify accounts (which many of us do with the family plan), this will be a 5 star rating!Less"

Granted it doesn't sound as good as my Apple Home pod, but it's a lot smarter. It plays games, hundreds of ambient sounds, internet radio stations, all for free and without any set up. You can set it to wake you up with whatever music or stations you want. You can use it as a multi-speaker system for each room or use it in tandem in stereo. It even works with a basic Honeywell thermostat which is neither supported by Apple nor Android. It works in conjunction with Apple Homekit and can even use the same commands, all done without set up! You can adjust the tone settings for deeper bass or sharper treble. For an extra geeky feature, you can even change the ""Alexa"" wake command to ""Computer"" or ""Echo""Less"
4.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Nice Little Speaker,"This was our first Echo device, I was planning on getting a dot sooner, however the speaker quality on the prior generations was just poor to say the least. Amazon really stepped up their game with this device - it has since moved to the kitchen, and an Echo Plus has taken its place in the Living Room as we now have Phillips Hue lights in our outside lights, and various rooms, however it remains a handy device for listening to Music and Podcasts. The Apple Music support is wonderful as someone who has used iTunes and Apple devices for more than 10 years and has numerous purchases"

My parents are elderly and sometimes need to call my sister in the middle of the night. The plan was for them to have this in the bedroom and just ask Alexa to call my sister if necessary. However, once we set it up, they love having the Amazon music plus the other skills that Alexa can be taught so we bought a second one for my parents’ living room/kitchen area. They can even use the intercom skill to speak directly to my sister in her house without needing a phone!"
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Great intro to Smart Speaking,"Very nice design, super easy to set up, sound quality ok, but what do you expect for the money? Improved by connecting to external speakers. Alexa interface is really good, works well in a noisy kitchen, now easy to ask for music, radio, set up multiple timers, and many other things too. Unfortunately, the grandchildren discovered Alexa’s great skill at making rude sounds. But for the money (special Xmas offer), it’s great - controls our lighting and heating, too."
5.0,9 months ago,Argos,Does exactly what it says on the tin,"We already have 1 echo in the house so setting up a second one was pretty easy. I literally switched it on, opened up my Alexa app and selected ‘add a new echo’. It found the new one within a matter of seconds and I didn’t even have to enter any WiFi passwords again- it’s just connected itself up straightaway. We were playing music within 5 mins of it coming out of the box. I will say though that the new one is a marked improvement on the old one. It’s bigger, looks better and sounds better too."
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great product,"Got this free with another purchase and was going to give to a family but decided to try it out for fun. I plan on keeping it. I have already ordered smart plugs & lights. I used the dot along with Alexa app to set up lights, shopping lists, music & alarm. Had no plan on paying a monthly fee for music but found out my SiriusXM package for my car can be set up through the app to play on the dot. A plus. Now that I am using it I wish I had the Show 5, only because it has a 5” screen. The dot 3rd generation is a great product & if u do not need a screen you won’t be disappointed."

The built-in speaker is not very loud for music and is really only good to hear Alexa assistant or talking in general. This is great however that it allows you to pair this with any Bluetooth speaker to send the audio to much better speakers. I am also using this with the 3.5 mm line out cable to hook this to my non-Bluetooth Sony alarm clock that is way too old to have built-in Bluetooth. I really like being able to send audio via Bluetooth to my sony sound bar by voice command! For the price, I paid though I think this is a good assistant to add to your smart home.Less"

Two 3rd generation and one 2nd generation. Wife loves listening to podcasts or music by Bluetooth thru it. Only con is Echo has issues re-hooking up to WiFi after an outage. You have to use Amazon Alexa App to re-pair it frequently. Not for your mom or dad with no tech skills or you’ll be over at their house all the time fixing. I have a Google Home Mini and has no issues after an outage so my choice vs Echo.

If you do not have a good internet / wifi connection, this may not work so well so please keep that in mind - every so often my dad has trouble with it responding and usually that is when his internet is being wonky."
3.0,a month ago,very.co.uk,Not ideal for kids,"Great if you’re an adult with Spotify premium and only have one dot. If you have them in kids room, they can’t play their music when they want as it stops your music on your dot. Unless I set the kids up with a premium account. - which I won’t be doing having 3 kids it’s going to be expensive! Or I pay amazon a fortune each year for a family subscription. Feel like I’ve been suckered in to something that doesn’t quite work how I want it too unless I spend even more money on it. So a bit disappointing. Still working things out so it might come good but I’m not feeling positive about it!"

The big Echo has great sound; the earlier Dots, well, they're OK, but really you'd want to connect a speaker to it. The 3rd generation, though, is much louder and has the sound quality of an equally priced Bluetooth speaker - but you get Alexa interactivity along with it. You do need a smart phone and the Amazon Echo app to use it. The first time it will take a few minutes to get it up and running, but if you want to add one for another room, it will barely take a minute."

Her voice is clear and loud for the alarm but nothing intrusive or startling. It wakes me at ease and does not let me doze back off. I love the light that shows the time- not too bright not too dark.

I found it wasn't great at certain angles and lights though (under TV from side angles couldn't read full time properly, most likely because of being round and showing through fabric holes).

I,m sure there is a way but not figured it out yet.No actual full downloadable user manual to help with things like the above. You have to google it."

If, however, you’re looking for a great sounding small speakers that also has very good smart features, then the Echo Dot is a great options. I haven’t used it much, as it was a gift (and I generally use my wireless JBL Flip 4), but I know the recipient of the gift has been happy. Main reason I couldn’t give it five stars is that it isn’t wireless. I learned that when I didn’t have it plugged in and was trying to show someone one its cool tricks and nothing happened.Less"

But the gen 2 Dot's sound quality was tinny and not anything close to the sound quality of an Echo, and Amazon acknowledged that readily. But the new gen 3 Dot has completely revamped the sound quality. At the lower and middle volume levels (up to about level 7 on a 10 level volume system) the sound is as good as an Echo. At the top loudness levels it distorts somewhat and is not quite as good as an Echo. But I never ramp the Dot's up that loud. The Dot sound is as good as an Echo's now, and it's 1/4 to 1/3 the price. I picked up one to try out at home. It was so great that I purchased 4 more immediately. They are throughout the house and one in the garage.

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Replaced our old cd player,I dont have the prior generations to compare to but I love the echo 3. The sound quality is very good for such a small inexpensive device. In fact its just as good as any bluetooth speaker Ive tested. Sure its not audiophile worthy but the sound is easily 3x better then what I paid for it. Alexa works very well controlling our lights and alarm system. Works great as a wake up alarm and it finally replaced our old cd stero which was taking up alot of space! The echo packs in alot of features at such a low price. Right now it is located in our kitchen and most of the time alexa can hear us from our bedroom which is very nice. We like it so much we will be adding additional ones in other areas of our home. My wife and I love it!

Now I have one in lounge, one in Kitchen and one in bedroom ! The one in bedroom sets my alarm to whatever music I want to wake me up and plays relaxing music at night to send me off and turns off whenever you ask it too !! All in all I think they’re brilliant !!!! And another bonus is I don’t use my phone as much as if I need to google anything I just ask Alexa ????"
5.0,10 months ago,Argos,Great value,"A great product. The third we own. The others are the earlier generation and there is most certainly a great improvement in sound quality with this new one. It's not hifi however if you want something that gives a warm and pleasant listening experience that is suitable for everyday use, is easy to setup and if you have prime has a large array of music to listen to then this is a good choice. Great for setting timers or listening to new music you've never tried before. Fun for the kids too."

I was not sure how they worked so I just gave one away and put the other two aside .... I saw really popular for Christmas so , I asked my son to set mine up for me... On Christmas .. I asked Alexa to play my favorite Christmas Song by the Temptations and she did so quick and then I asked for my favorite Artist Whitney's Christmas and it shuffled her Christmas Songs .. OMG... it was so hard to put my egg nog down and stop listening to go to bed for work the next day. I am so glad I got my son to set it up for me.."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Alexa the hostess,"This is my first smart device. Alexa was easy to set up & came with a lot of freebies, like Amazon Prime, Amazon Music, Amazon Reading & Audiobooks. I'll have to cancel in a month though, but it s a good taste to sample and keep what I like. I've downloaded games, word of the day, the news etc. it is endless. I could spend the whole day telling Alexa what to do, but I mostly use her for music and answering questions. I find that she doesn't know a lot, so if you're a kid, she can't do your homework, only basic question and answers. She can be connected to smart dimmers, light bulbs etc, but I have yet to buy and connect those things. So, right now, echo is pretty fantastic. She is a great hostess at parties, adjusting the music to my guests' tastes & preferences."
3.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Most features of this product remain to be explore,"It works, no question about that. The audio has more bass than the Google Home which I've used for some months. I prefer less bass. Is it adjustable? ---I suspect not. Currently, I probably know how to use only 5% of its capability. I am troubled by what I've read and heard about its constant listening to whatever it can hear. That has detered me from constant use. Wish I knew what was true and what wasn't about its listening!"

My children are 10 and 6 and both use it every day. It's easy to use and to set up. They both play music through it, I can contact them when dinner is ready (godsend for my son) as I've connected the alexa to his Xbox headsets and he can hear me straight away instead of me shouting numerous times. Exceeded my expectations, and now I really want one."

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Far greater sound than previous generations,"The new Amazon Echo Dots really show they're meant for music. After buying my grandmother one for the far-field microphones, I was finally able to hear how they really sound. I must say, it was better than I thought. There's finally some real definition, mainly in the mids and highs but there is still a decent amount of bass. Since they can be paired together as stereo I decided to take advantage of the holiday pricing and grabbed two of them for $50. Having them set in stereo was a whole new level. Throw in the recently added Apple Music access and its absolutely perfect for my room. Theres even the Echo Sub that adds deep and rich bass that I'm considering adding to my group."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Echo Dot 3rd Gen,"Great Sound for little speaker, especially when using with Wi-Fi/Internet. Easy to set up individually. Download app for adding more for whole home simultaneous play. Alexa has many, many features and will take time to lean. Amaonzon will periodically send emails (if you sign up) providing additional command recommendations, etc. Con: Always listening (can easily turn off) and sends info to them on your commands (for learning and making improvements, etc)."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Best bargain purchased in 2019,"Bought 3, one for my mother in law and one each for my children. Set up was quite confusing for my mother in law so she needed some support. Ease of use is top notch, looks good and sound quality is brilliant. Children discovered they could phone eachothers echos,which kept them quiet for a while. Love the fact each machine can be set up to only take instructions/questions from 1 person by identifying their voice which is good if your children like to wind each other up. ""Best presents ever!"""
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Once upon a time a life without Echo,"Before we had this thing we just didn't really care about these fancy smart home devices thingies. Now we can't imagine our daily little tasks without Echo's help. She controls the house's temperature ( obviously, after we tell her to do so); she takes notes, setup timer, makes phone calls, search random stuff in the internet etc. The best part is: She is the only one in the house that listens to me. Cons: If you have more than one Alexa enabled device in the house, you will have to give them different names, and I think there are only four or five names that you use to call them. So let's say you have an Alexa enabled thermostat and and Amazon Echo dot nearby and they are both called Alexa. It happens that every time you call Alexa, both your thermostat and Echo will respond and operate at the same time.Less"
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Excellent upgrade to the Echo Dot!,"I've previously had the 2nd generation dot and the 3rd gen without the clock. The addition of the clock makes it an ideal bedside alarm clock, and a much welcomed upgrade! Sound quality is great, and plenty loud enough for multi-room/bedroom music with no noticeable loss of quality. The clock display is nice and clear, and the brightness automatically changes with the brightness in the room, e.g. dims at night but still easily readable."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,"Great new ""Must Have""",We bought this clock for my husband as a gift. He said he wanted a new alarm clock. The kids decided Dad needed to stay up with technology and needed this personal assistant. It can control the lights and music as well as set individual alarms each morning. It easily recognizes our speech and commands. It can wake up slowly or suddenly. It can play peaceful bedtime sounds to put you to sleep. Sounds of nature are available.
4.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Bought for my elderly mom,Bought this so we could drop-in on our elderly mom to check on her and she could call us if she fell and did not have her phone handy. We like the drop-in feature so we can just talk to her and ask if her phone is off the hook. She hears it as well as the phone. She likes that she can play music from Pandora and we enabled a Bible App for her and plan to add the Libby-overdrive app. She is also using it to do her grocery list and turn off her lamp. She seems to like it and we will likely buy another so her whole house is covered. I think this is great for seniors who live alone. I have one at my house as well.
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Amazing Little Speaker At An Amazing Price,"I think everyone should have one of these devices because it makes our life a lot easier from playing our favorite music to turning our lights on and off, helping in the kitchen with recipies, using an informational device to hear the news, weather and so much more. The speaker is very loud, crisp and very good quality and I don't think you can find just a speaker at this price. I was apple to get this device on sale which was half of the retail price. I would recommend this device to everyone especially seniors who may end up using this device in an emergency."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Fantastic Product!,"After buying the other similar device from the search engine brand, which I returned to store as it was very unresponsive I got the Amazon Alexa Echo Dot as a replacement. The Echo Dot is fantastic and great design. It is very responsive to ANYONE that talks to it, even visitors! The nice LED ring shows Alexa is responding properly. The sound quality is impressive for a small device and it can also be linked to another speaker via AUX or Bluetooth if needed. Great App too. Buy One!"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Love!,"Bought for my 7yr old son. He loves it. With a little extra looking over a few things, I pretty much have a children's edition, in a regular echo dot. He cannot purchase anything, his music is filtered so he doesn't hear any bad words, and he's happy. And in a couple years when he's older, I can change things and he's got a regular echo dot, or I can keep it for myself somewhere else in my house. Love the music subscription! Loved his so much, I purchased one for myself."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,5th Echo Dot!,This is my 5th echo dot! Bought this for my daughter's room. My other reviews have mentioned about the Spotify limitation where you can only link one Spotify account to each Alexa account. I now just get around this by setting up a different Alexa account for both my son and my daughter. This allows us to attach their respective Spotify accounts to their own echo dots such that all of us can play our own songs at the same time through different echo dots around the house. The downside of this setup though is that I am not able to use the shared features of using multiple echo dots e.g. playing the same music around the house (like a multi-speaker system) or using features like 'drop in' to talk to folks in different parts of the house. I hope Alexa can be linked to multiple Spotify accounts soon.Less

After we plugged in Echo, we wanted to hear some hip tunes. I asked Siri to play The Everly Brothers but nothing happened, no response at all. I figured maybe The Everly Brothers didn’t come standard with Echo so I asked Siri to play The Drifters, once again nothing. Though Echo doesn’t respond to me even with every pronunciation of Siri I know it does add a “modern” touch to our vintage house as my son would say. - Josh’s Mom"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Best alarm clock you can buy,"Picked this up during the holidays for under 40 bucks. Connects very easy and helps control a lotnof smart home gadgets. Bridges the gap between some hubs and devices that may not be compatible. I was very reluctant to allow Amazon to listen in, but figured apple, google, and microsoft are already listening on so what's the difference. Got three of these things and 3 echo shows so the CIA, NSA, and all the others dont miss a single word uttered in my house."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,The paranoia has passed.,Swore I'd never have one of these in the house for fear of Alexa listening to my every conversation. Got to play with one over the holidays and thought it was pretty cool tech. Use it mostly for streaming music to other speakers and have started exploring the other features. It's a cool toy and I've pretty much gotten over the big brother phobia. It feels solid and well made. Speaker isn't audiophile quality but works in a pinch.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great introduction to Alexa ecosystem or expansion,"The dot is a great way to start your venture I to smarthome or a cheap way to add to it. The 3rd gen has greatly improved audio over the 2nd gen dot to the point it's usuable as a music speaker either by itself in a small room or paired in stereo with another. Microphone pick up is great when calling to it, and the color choices allow to match a shelf, counter, or table. Don't buy it just to get a speaker, but learn about using Alexa for home automation and other tasks. I am very happy with our home set up (2 floor house and finished basement): 2 floor - 2nd gen echo in master bedroom, dot in hallway, dit kids edition in 2 bedrooms and dot in 4th bedroom 1st floor - 2, 2nd gen echo plus paired in stereo in living room, echo show 2nd gen in one kitchen counter, 2 other 2nd gen echos and 3 dots through out rest of floor Basement - firetv paired to home theatre and another dot on otherside.Less"

On leaving home I usually say ""Alexa play some relaxing music for two hours for the dogs"" she keeps them serenaded. She is always ready to answer that question we have. I have 2 dot 3's and an original dot around the house and an Echo Show in the kitchen. It also tells us when we have a package delivered or have notifications. Just learning but also have smart plugs that we tell ""Alexa turn on plug 1"" or off. We turn our living room lamp on this way. So much more possible."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,I Want More,"Sounds quality is an definite improvement over the 2nd gen. So loud! Functionality is amazing does everything I want and need and even some I don't. I've also noticed a new feature was added where I can stream music across all of my connected devices. Its amazing. I want one for every space. Dont actually need it though since they're loud. Also, theyre really easy to set up. I have no complaints and the kids love it."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Fun addition to the house,"Overall, this is a really cool device. I initially purchased one and set it up just outside the kitchen in the family room, which we call the music room because it's the room where we have the piano. I connected it to my Sony receiver via the 3.5mm jack to RCA,(Red and White plugs). I would recommend this setup as the Echo Dot speaker is good for small rooms, but doesn't have much power to project across rooms. Fun, useful device! I purchased one more for the living room and created a speaker group called Everywhere. This gives you the ability to play the same music in different rooms. Understand that if you setup a speaker group, it won't work with the Echo Dot if it's connected to a Bluetooth device or speakers."
3.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,It’s a great device with issues,I bought it to add to my other bedroom. She has a hard time understanding me and has issues out the wazoo. 2 weeks after buying it and one night I want to play music she plays it the randomly the sound stops and her speaker went out internally so I restarted her and she still sound funny. Yesterday at 4am the bedroom lights are on 100% while I am asleep. Like I said issues. I have another echo dot in the master bedroom that works great and I have a Alexa in the living room that is great as well. Sad part about the new dot I bought I can’t return it so I may not buy another one
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Great to have around the house,"It's been extremely reliable. Very few times has it misheard it's name or not had an accurate response. It's great to be able to play music anywhere in the house since we decided to buy a second. At first the idea of having one was more to just be able to say we had one, but the kids love using it and asking goofy questions, and being able to make announcements or tell Alexa to turn off our lights or adjust the thermostat is our new norm... Can't wait to see where technology takes us. The next generation is going to be so lazy... We are doomed. lol"
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,"Wow, the sound is amazing!","I have to say after having heard sound from the 1st gen echo dot and the 2nd gen echo dot, I was not expecting the sound coming from this device to sound as full as it does. It definitely sounds miles better than the previous generation of dots. You get all the features you would normally get in an echo devices but in a compact size and with great sound. Music, calling, smart home, lists, skills, shopping, etc. With new features and updates being added continuously. Great update to the echo dot line."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Excellent quick internet research/music player con,"This is our 4th Alexa device for our home and for our son's room. Device is small enough to fit inconspicuously in room. We use it to play music, to intercom from room to room, and amazingly for many quick internet searches, such as sports stats and results, history of people and events, and proper spelling of difficult to spell words. These are only a few things we use Alexa/Echo for. We're not concerned if and whether big brother is listening."
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Great upgrade from previous models,"Purchased the 2nd generation ones when they were on sale during the holidays. Was disappointed with the sound quality of those compared to the 2nd gen Echoes I currently have. Was initially hesitant to get this 3rd gen, but after seeing positive reviews about it's improved sound quality, along with a reduced price, I took the bait. Needless to say I was satisfied with the decision! The sound quality has definitely improved from the previous generation! I recommend it!"
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Wake words are complicated,"I've had trouble setting this up in in my kitchen, which is connected to my living room which has a fire TV cube. The reason this was complicated is because they sometimes compete to listen to my voice. If I set them in the same room, then the fire TV cube cannot control my TV volume, only controls my echo volume. If I set them in different rooms, then I have to use different wake words so I activate the specific one I want. The product itself is quite useful, but I have to change settings every once in a while to try to get it exactly how I need it to be."
4.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Good if you have amazon prime,"Echo dot is a really good device: the microphones are sensitive, the speaker quality is great for what it is, and Alexa is competent. However, if you're looking for better integration with other smart devices, the google home may be a better pick, especially if you don't have Amazon Prime. The google home app on your phone is also better than the Alexa app, at least on iOS. That all being said, Alexa works well and I would recommend this if you're looking to add a digital assistant to your home."

Occasional connectivity issues but then I do travel internationally with mine so it has to connect to lots of new hotspots. I dont do any shopping with it, just use it as a smart speaker. I have linked it to my spotify account which is great"

Plays most of the radio stations which goes through Tunin. Cons: She doesn't answer the questions. Mostly says: Sorry I don't know that. It can hear you only in one room. Even though 50% she's not getting the words right. And the lights are on and spinning around in a circle even if it's off.Can't play music from YouTube or anywhere else."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,"Works Great, better than the 2nd gen Echo Dot",The Echo Dot 3rd generation is awesome. When comparing it to the 2nd gen Echo Dot there is a large difference in sound quality and output. The 3rd gen Echo Dot sounds better in all aspects and also looks like a more premium product. There are a lot of great streaming services you can use to play music including Spotify and Apple Music. Overall a great update to the Echo Dot line of Amazon Products.
5.0,7 months ago,Argos,Easy to set up,"I had already bought an echo dot and loved it so decided to get another for upstairs. This is so easy to set up and connect to wi-fi, either primarily and even more so as a second one. It's a great gadget to play music through, ask questions (especially converting measurements for baking), playing games. I particularly love how it syncs with my google calendar and adds events on it. I'm sure there's more I haven't even found out about yet. I thoroughly recommend it, good fun and so so useful."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Awesome,"Gen 3 speaker and mic is better then Gen 2. When asking Alexa to recognize your voice make sure you mute the mic on all dots when she is asking you questions. Her saying Alexa to herself will disrupt anything shes saying and will activate all the other dots around the house. Over all love this item. Grouping, routines and timing will be hard at first but you will get the hang of it. There are many vidoes on youtube that help learn Alexa and how to build a routine."
5.0,3 months ago,ebay.com,I frickin LOVE these Alexa Dots!,I just purchased my 2nd dot. Needed one for the bedroom. I've already got the one in the living room turning on lights and my stereo. I also hooked it up to play music thru my stereo. These things are incredibly handy. What's the temperature? How much caffeine is in Diet Coke? What's the football score? How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood? She knows that too! lol Buy one. Trust me. This is one of those things you don't realize you need until you have it.
5.0,8 months ago,ebay.com,It's like a voice activated computer,The one thing that stuck out above everything else about the Echo Dot 3 is how extremely fast it responses and does most things. I can ask it to play a certain song and it's playing it faster than I can turn on and click on any other streaming device. I can ask most questions and the answer is almost immediate. It's like a voice activated computer at a bargain price ! I can turn on my lights when both arms are full. It allows me to do several things at once. The Echo Dot 3 has made my life easier.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great little assistant,"Had this for about a month now so I feel like I can give an honest review. Like most people say it puts out good sound. I have found myself using it for white noise at night (rainfall, rain forrest noise). I use it for local info weather for cast temperature. It works well withoit having to repeat myself. I use it to set timers and reminders, that's about it all by itself. Now if you have Alexa devices like I use ecobee thermostat and it's great turning it up or down when I'm downstairs without having to actually go to the thermostat. My next purchase will be a Phillips HUE hub to control the lights. I will say I have both Google and Alexa and I find myself perffering to say Alexa rather than hey Google. Seems more of an assistant saying Alexa"

I gave this to my daughter for the holidays for her to take back to her dorm. She loves it. We have the original echo as an integrated part of our kitchen. Makes her feel a little bit of home in her dorm. Setup was a breeze and as I said sound quality is great for its size. My daughter uses it for knowledge games and whenever she has a question. Great product!

After installing the Alexa app and set up the device, you can do pretty much of everything, i.e. News, weather, traffic, playing music, tell a story, joke, just love the application, need to explore more of what Alexa has to offer. The only thing I'm concerned is Contact info, I was told even though you don't allow access to contact list, somehow Alexa can still access it, not sure if that's true. Anyway, great product, enjoying having it around."

On the lighter side, the speaker produces a really quality sound throughout the entire room when you stream the internet.

The following a is quote from one of the sites offering help. The comments run the same through the other sites. “Last month Amazon said it would eventually allow its voice-controlled virtual assistant Alexa to work on mobile devices, provided those devices are tablets made by Amazon. ""Eventually"" means now. However everything is mentioned except Samsung” Amazon seems to have an issue with Samsung that affects the consumer. I keep trying to like Amazon.

The installation was easy, just plug in and download the app. It probably took about 5 to 10 minutes to complete. The sound quality of the speaker is good too. It is far superior than the other speakers we have. Alexa has kept us upto date with the weather, played music, and answered our questions...Only problem now, is that my partner talks to Alexa, more than me!"

I can’t believe how fast Alexa finds the music I ask for, even when I can’t remember the artist or title and sing her a line, she finds the piece in an instant. Cons: Once or twice since Christmas Alexa has suddenly crackled & stopped and doesn’t respond. I have just switched the echo dot off then back on again a few moments later. The problem didn’t appear to be wifi related, so this is a mystery."
4.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Great accessory for smart home,The echo dot lacks power but that is expected of such a small speaker and you can connect it to larger speakers via Bluetooth or 3.5mm. I use it in the bedrooms and office. You can intercom with other echo devices which is cool if you’re lazy like us. It’s also used as an alarm clock. It also controls other compatible smart devices. It is a great add on but I would recommend the larger speakers for a central unit
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Great tool for any smart home!,"We bought this as our fourth echo dot, which are distributed through two homes. What these things can do is amazing! Command any of them to “open the magic door” to see what we mean. You can pause the adventure on one and pick it up on any of the others. We use them as radios to follow sports, etc. and move from one to another. We are planning to get more when they are on special. The “drop in” functions as an intercom system between homes. Once connected to the internet you just need to experiment!"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Awesome addition to my smart hime,I have an Echo that covers my livingroom dining room and kitchen area if my house. I got this Echo Dot as an add on to some Hue products I bought from BBY right after Christmas. I have it paired to a soundbar in my bedroom which works great. I can now play music through my sound bar using Alexa and can use this dot to control my other smart devices from my bedroom. The speaker definately isn't as powerful as the Echo but it is still plenty powerful enough for me to speak to and hear responses from my connected bathroom or closet. It was a great way to extend Alexa into another room and I may pick up another one of these for my guest bedroom.
5.0,a month ago,Argos,brilliant !,"Bought the echo dot for hubby, smaller than I imagined but well worth the money. Easy to use and set up and does exactly what it says on the box ! Good fun, asking questions and choosing different songs, sound is good on it too. Looking forward to setting reminders on it. Slightly concerned hubby is going to speak to Alexa more than myself but if it keeps him amused its a good buy Also really liked the heather grey option. Great gift for any member of the family.."
4.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Bedside radio for the digital age,"Frustration with radio signal quality in our kitchen led to the idea that an Echo Dot is a great radio replacement in a wi-fi environment. Now every nightstand has a Dot tucked behind a lamp or picture, ready to stream radio stations, podcasts or music, to give time and weather on command, to act as an alarm or reminder, to record things for a shopping list, etc. The speaker is not bad, and can easily be upgraded by connecting to better speakers with bluetooth or an audio cable. All that for about the price of a clock radio."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Its Alexa!,"This is my second device; I own the 2nd generation and there is an amazing improve with sound and appearance. This one I use without any other speaker because the sound quality its amazing for a small room. Also, the voice detection improves the answer from Alexa, having the dot understanding almost everything from a considered distance. Besides that, all the apps keep working without any issue. Finally, appearance its much better with that fabric around the device."
5.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Alexa family,"This is the third Echo item we’ve purchased for our household, and we love them! Every since we bought the first one, we knew we’d be buying more. They are great, easy to use, and their features are spectacular. For example, I can send an announcement from my phone through the app to be announced through the Echo to whoever’s at home. It’s so great because I can say things like “Announce that I am at the grocery store in case anyone needs anything” and I’ll get texts from family who heard the announcement. Technology."
5.0,10 months ago,John Lewis,"Usefully connects to my Sonos and also makes my other sound system ""smart"" by streaming to it","Positives .... for such a low price I can now voice control my Sonos Play 1 and also stream music to my Roberts sound system (via cable). If you want a ""fuller"" music library, you can subscribe to Amazon Music Unlimited - but thats only £3.99 a month for one device (the Echo) Negatives .... the Echo Dot doesn't have the best sound in the world - but I'm not using it. I would have liked to rename it to something other than ""Alexa, Echo or Computer"" - Holly would have been 1st choice ;-); You can't connect it to Apple Music;"
4.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Great addition to our other Echo,"This is our second one. This one stays in the Master while the other one is in the Guest Bedroom. It can fully control smart connections in our house. There is a limitation on the sound though on this unit. It sounded good but it starts to lose the bass as you increase the volume. If Bose has a version of Alexa, I will get the Bose. However, for the price, this is really good because I bet Bose will cost more if they create one with Alexa control."
5.0,3 weeks ago,Best Buy,Small but mighty,"I never thought I would own anything like this. I was fine playing music from my ear buds or from my phone speaker. When this was on sale, I decided to give it a try. I like that I can ask Alexa anything. The sound quality it great for my small space. I never knew what I was missing out on. They do try to get you to sign up for Amazon music, because Alexa says she can play xyz for free, but you can sign up for Amazon music. It is a nice little addition to my technology bucket."
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Huge Upgrade to the 2nd Gen Dot,"I have 6 Alexa Dot's in my house. I know, I know..... I never really meant for it to be that way, my past three have been given as gifts and/or promotional items (like this one I got for buying the Ring Security system). I never realized how bad the sound was in my 2nd gen dots until I played music from this one. It is a NOTICEABLE difference. Bass especially gets an upgrade and everything is just more clear. While it's slightly bigger, it's definitely worth it and I would wholeheartedly recommend this over the 2nd gen."
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Awesome Voice Assistant!,"This Alexa is a really good Voice Assistant, with many commands to tell and a few cool easter eggs! The compact design is also a nice feat, compared to others. I have also paired this with my lights, which is also cool as well. You can also play music on it, and connect it to Bluetooth. Overall the compact design and the features of this Voice Assistant make it a really good device! I recommend getting this, even if you don't need it."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Nice but not as useful as Google,"I have mixed feelings about the Dot. Sound quality is okay until you turn it up a bit then distortion kicks in. Functionality is okay. It's interface with Harmony Hub is unreliable. Sometimes it works great, other times it loses track of the connection. The same is true of the interface with KasaTP-Link. It frequently loses the connection. We also have a Google Home Hub in the house. It seems to be more reliable with its Harmony Hub connectivity. Google also seems to be more user friendly and understands queries better than Alexa, I asked both when it was going to rain today. Google responded with very specific information regarding the times it might be raining. Alexa just said it might rain today, 59% at 11 a.m. I've also purchased the Amazon Echo but haven't opened yet. I may return it and purchase the Google product line instead.Less"
4.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Great when it works!,"I've had a fair share of defective Echo dots since Best Buy ran their promotion of Fire TVs with Echo dots. Best Buy has a fantastic return policy if you get a defective item. However, Amazon still has a bit to go when it comes to tweaking the software for these devices. I literally have had two of them completely go mute. They would light up as if they were acknowledging your commands, but no audio or execution of actions would result. Overall great technology just needs some fine-tuning."
4.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Good sound quality,"I was surprised at how much I like this after having read a lot of news stories recently about these devices and privacy concerns. I like that you can mute this so that it's not listening when you don't want it to. I am very pleased with the sound quality - it has a nice, rich sound compared to the sound that comes directly from the iPad. I'm also getting used to dealing with Alexa. She does not always respond the way I need her to, even when I'm being super clear. But that might be user error that will be worked out over time."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Smart addition to the Echo family,"This little beauty is a compact, sounds surprisingly brilliant for such a small unit. The clock is an added bonus to this version of the Echo Dot. We already have a full size Echo but wanted something portable so we can take it on our travels and this fits the bill. Ok, the full size echo sounds better but this is amazing value for money and having the clock, allows it to function as a great alarm clock too. Do I recommend this? Absolutely!!!"
5.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Excellent,"I’ve been hesitant about getting An echo dot. I’m glad I waited though the 3rd generation has a good look about it. It functions really well. The speaker has a good volume to it and the mic picks up without any trouble. Ive been playing with the lights in my house for about 30 minutes now just in awe of this technology. The more I pay attention to technology the more I see ‘compatible with alexa’. I do not regret this purchase, I’m just going to need more bulbs."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Merry Xmas to me,"Bought the Amazon Echo Dot gen 3 for hubby for Xmas. Got such a good deal, I bought 2 of them so that he could have one in the living room by his recliner and one in the bedroom on the night stand. They were super easy to set up. Downloading the app took the most time. You can Google how to set up and watch a YouTube video for extra help. We had fun asking Alexa everything from what the temperature is outside to what time our favorite sports team would be playing. We ended up putting the first unit in the kitchen (open floor plan flows into the living room). I use that unit all the time to play music while I’m cooking. We both love the device. We haven’t even tapped its full potential yet (games, connectivity to RING doorbell device, etc) but we will. Highly recommend it!"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Much Better Sound Than 2nd Gen,"This 3rd generation of Echo Dot has noticeably much better sound quality than the 2nd generation Echo Dot (and presumably the 1st generation). The Dot also has a much nicer and softer look to it--not as industrial. If you can get this for the reduced price that alone would justify the purchase because it is good for use as a bluetooth speaker for the home. If you have smart products, the ability to control them is an added bonus. You will need to have an Amazon account to use it. Also, I understand that the 3rd gen Dot has fewer microphones than the 2nd gen and it seems like there are more times when it does not register my ""Alexa"" prompt and I am forced to speak louder. Again, the reduced price is worth it just to use as a bluetooth speaker but voice recognition and smart device control can be real spotty.Less"
4.0,a month ago,Currys,Rachel's review of Amazon Echo Dot 3rd Generation with Clock - Sandstone,"Pros: Alexa does end up feeling like a member of the household! Cons: You can’t unplug the echo dot and use it anywhere without the cable being connected which is a huge shame. Amazon Music is not a great music library compared to other providers either, so we steam music from another provider to our dot. The sound quality for music is reasonable, but don’t expect a supreme sound for the price."
4.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,New to Amazon,"This is my first, Amazon assistant of any kind. After using Google assistant I find them similar, but different for certain things. If you want to control things around your house, then the Amazon product is for you. If you need answers to things, Google does a much better job. The Echo setup easily and works perfect. I was able to pair several devices without issue. The sound quality is good, not great. Purchased this one sale for $25, GREAT deal!!"
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,I have triplets! This is my third Alexa,"I have 3 girls. They work well at turning the lights on and off. They are awesome speakers when I connect to you tube music or Amazon music. But many times, Alexa will say she doesn't understand. I find it frustrating esp since Google Asst on my phone comprehends better. But, since I'm lazy & alot of the times just having my hands full, it's easiest to just tell Alexa to turn off the lights for me or tell me when my alarm goes off or if my commute will be bad or not. Thanks Alexa!x3"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Seems buggy at times,"I've had the 2nd gen dot for a while in my home and just replaced it with two new 3rd gen dots. one in the living room and one in the bedroom. The device itself is more aesthetically pleasing and the speaker on this one is way better but my only complaint I suppose is that they have seemed to be a lot more prone to not working right than the last one I had. At times, she may not hear the wake word, other times shes way to sensitive. The follow-up command seems buggy, sometimes working and at other times not. Things she used to be able to control she cannot ""communicate with"" Keep in mind that these issues seem sporadic, sometimes non-existent and then giving trouble the next. These things could potentially be fixed in future updates though. Just a comparison of mine from my 2nd gen to my new 3rd gens.Less"
5.0,6 days ago,ebay.com,"Alexa Echo Dot (3rd Gen) is a winner, no doubt about it, it's ace!","Really fab! It's inexpensive, yet wonderful quality and ability. As a Music Device in it's own right it's worth hundreds alone. It can give you inspirational quotes, read the bible to you, hands free voice activated phone calling and hosting... It can even lead you on relaxing calming meditations, and it's functionality keeps getting added to. A must have purchase."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Fantastic all around resource for your house/room,"The third gen echo dot is a fantastic resource for your house and/or rooms. By calling ""Alexa"" you can have it play all kinds of music, have it answer your questions on various topics, give you the latest weather or Dow Jones closing info and more. It will make a shopping list for you and wake you up in the morning. I have two, one in my room and one in the kitchen/dining/living room area. Frankly, it is close to the ""library computer"" that the Star Trek series relied on all those years. I feel this is one of the best devices made in recent years. Wouldn't live without at least one! Echo dot may be set up from either a mobile phone or a desktop computer that has a WIFI connection."
4.0,5 days ago,Best Buy,Conspiracy nut gives in,"For a true tin foil hat guy to buy this is a life evaluating event. But my favorite aspect of this is I don't even have to search FOR ANYTHING on my phone anymore. Or even type anymore. I just say Alexa, play crazy train and BOOM! Ozzy is singing to me. Seriously tho, I'd recommend this for any older parents. They can talk so no typing and everything will be at the end of the tongue now. Delivery, cab, google searches, music, instructions to a certain dish and so on."
5.0,a year ago,Target,Get a Dot...!,"A strong improvement over previous versions. The Dot (3 rev) has is slightly larger then its predecessor and has a much better speaker with a mid and bass tone that was not present before. There is an equalizer in the Alexa app that allows for tuning the sound you want. I did have a speaker issue with one of the new Dots (3 rev) I purchased. The speaker was very raspy in the mid frequency range as though the speaker was not installed correctly or was damaged. I returned that Dot as defective and the new is working perfectly. I think you'll enjoy the Dot and Alexa very much. It becomes a very helpful tool for music, news, weather, spelling, and a very large range of other abilities."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Better than i expected,"I have put off getting any kind of smart speaker but finally caved when i saw these on sale for 25 bucks. Boy am i glad i did though. This little thing is incredibly convenient, saving me time when i just ask alexa something i would have had to pull my phone out for, and playing my music from spotify or any song i want it to play whenever i ask. The speaker quality is impressive for being so small and having so much utility packed into such a small package. Overall a great buy."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Love it!,"This was a great buy. I lucked out and got a 2 for 1 special on the smart speakers. I previously bought a similar unit that was a different color and it projects the time on it so I can use it like an alarm clock. I like both of them, but the special allowed me to get two of the darker colored units without the clock for the same price that I paid for the one white speaker that works as a clock. Overall, I would recommend this smart speaker. It was easy to hook up and works well."
5.0,a week ago,Best Buy,I do not have to get up to turn off the light,The only reason why I bought an Alexa was to not get up to turn off the light at night when I'm all tucked in. I know it sounds silly but you know those times when you're so comfortable in bed binge watching Netflix and just really don't want to get up to turn off the light... well this is your solution! Love it! AND it also plays relaxing sounds to help you sleep and you can set a timer for it and also an alarm there's endless things Alexa will do for you. She even raps and barks like a dog to make my baby nephew giggle. Highly recommend!
4.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Alexa Tell me A Joke,"Its a dot...not many bells and whistles but that's what I wanted. I got this to allow me to voice control my firestick without reaching for the controller. I know..welcome to 2019, we are all lazy. Haha! The design is nice and sleek. Looks great on my night stand. Works flawlessly with my firestick. Set up is a bit complicated, specially if you want to sync it with your firestick but YouTube, you'll be fine. For the price you cant beat it. If you have a Firestick this is a must have. I have a Google home and a Dot, they both come in handy."
4.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Very cool device.,"Received this for the holiday's and was apprehensive at first. However, as time as gone on I have come to really enjoy it. I can ask simple questions about many subjects for general info, but for me the best part is that if you can sync to a bluetooth sound device (or using it's sad little speaker) and listen to any radio station anywhere by just telling it. One can also listen to Amazon music, but I find that I can access a lot more choices by going online with a device or computer. I do recommend the Echo Dot and would maybe get the Echo model with the better speakers."
3.0,2 months ago,influenster.com,"The Amazon Echo Dot is a great product and can be used for many things like playing music, setting alarms/timers, setting reminders, make grocery lists, and even make phone calls.

If you don’t have these items in your home then there are not a lot of things that you can do with your echo but it is definitely a great item to have in you home.","The Amazon Echo Dot is a great product and can be used for many things like playing music, setting alarms/timers, setting reminders, make grocery lists, and even make phone calls.

I have them connected to my phone. But I found out you could program the Echo Dot to them. I have gotten used to talking to it. I now command it to turn on and turn off certain things around my home. You can command it to guard your home. You can ask where your orders are. If you say good morning it will give you information as to what happened on that date years ago. You can joke with it too. The things you can do with it are endless."

It is great for random questions making it much more convenient to get the answer without putting too much effort into it. Soothing night sounds are great way to fall asleep. I am so use to it now that I can’t sleep without them. Argos customer service was great. Quick order and quick collection at tills. Very satisfied customer here!!!
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Good entry point for Echo home automation,I now have a few of the 3rd gen Dot's. The sound quality and volume output for music is very good...especially for their size. They are very responsive to voice commands. When used in multiples they can act as an intercom system and multi-room music systems along with MANY other features. I like that they are now available in a growing number of colors. Last one I bought was the sandstone color and it's quite nice looking.

I gave it 4/5 stars bc I personally have Google Home and think it’s better. I don’t really have anything to compare that to though. It all started as a gift I received and we built from there. This dot seems cool and these spoiled little kids are happy :)"
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Awesome and convenient!,"I was always skeptical about whether or not Amazon Echo was worth the money. Well BestBuy had a great deal with the purchase of one of their FireStick TVs so I didn't have to directly go out and buy one. This little smart speaker is a gem. It makes simple things like checking the weather, playing music, or setting reminders that much simpler. You don't even have to lift a finger. I guess it's a millennial's dream lol. I never knew I needed one until I got one."

1.0,11 months ago,ebay.com,My new friend Alexa,I am very pleased with myEcho Dot. I live in a flat where it is difficult to get a single for a radio so this is the perfect answer. It is small and compact and I like the sandstone colour as it fits in with my colour scheme. Its good to be able to adjust the sound and give Alexa a command from a distant without having to stop what you are doing. The amount of commands available is staggering although I only use it for the music which I have down loaded. Would certainly recommend an Echo Dot especially to someone who has a mobility problem.

If you have a few more pennies &/or are hard of hearing, I’d recommend looking at an Echo Show 8 first. Echo Show 8 links to Prime videos & gives the lyrics to music so you can sing along. It also provides subtitles to news, films & TV shows. Can Link to Amazon Music. Please note, they are not rechargeable and must be continually plugged into a socket."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Small, compact design. Sounds quality is OK.","The Echo Dot 3rd Gen mimics the design of it's big brother from the fabric covered sides to the color changing top light. It's convenient to use and easy to setup, just like the regular Echo. In fact, it does everything my regular echo does, but for less. That is, unless you want to use it to listen to music. The sound quality leaves a lot to be desired (though it's partly to be expected from such a small device). Music is tinny and doesn't have any depth. The regular Echo performs much better if you're looking forward to using it to listen to music. Or simply connect it to an external speaker."

I think this works perfectly for what it is and can be expected from a small device. We picked this particular one up for our cottage/cabin and its been performing flawlessly up there. Speaker works well, microphone hears us from a room or two away (open floor plan) and the color is a nice charcoal. We are very pleased with this unit for the money."
5.0,7 months ago,very.co.uk,Absolutely great speaker with so many features,I ordered 3 of these Echo Dot’s this week and have set them up. I was wary because I have iPhone and IPad and no android devices but this works perfectly. You can link your Apple Music account to the Alexa app and then Alexa will play music from that. I ordered3 in the hope that I can get rid of my sound bars that just look too big and untidy! I’ve also linked the 3 Dot’s so I can play music across all 3 rooms. Never thought they would be this good for the price. I would highly recommend.
2.0,a month ago,influenster.com,"I like using Alexa for the sound system aspect of it, but I don't really use her for the ""personal assistant"" aspect. She could be useful for someone who is more tech savvy but I don't really like it. Also I know there are issues with people hacking into your Alexa account. I synced my spotify to my device and within the next few days my spotify account was hacked.. would play random music by artists i've never even heard of. My alexa would be going off at odd hours of the day without me prompting it to. Very strange.","I like using Alexa for the sound system aspect of it, but I don't really use her for the ""personal assistant"" aspect.

5.0,4 months ago,Argos,Glad I brought this,"After reviewing countless speakers online and viewing so many different options I chose to go ahead with the Alexa Dot. It’s a neat stylish compact speaker that looks the part (I chose it in white) The sound is good, but with a spacious lounge area and tiled floors the sound can come across rather tingy at times. For the price you can’t go wrong, if you want a speaker that can sound angelic on quiet nights in listening to tunes and then turn into a little monster when you want some volume."
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Love it,"Works great with my stereo and other products, Spotify Amazon. Out of the box can be a little confusing connecting to Internet and then phone app. But once its passed that setup, everything starts to work great. Total setup time for basic user is probable 30-1 hour. Someone techy could probably do this in 15-30 min. YouTube maybe a good resource to find out how to setup as well. Will need a pigtail to connect to stereo to play though speakers."
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Surprisingly Good Sound Quality,"We bought an Echo Plus (2nd generation) and an Echo Dot (3rd generation) at the same time. We targeted the Plus because it was advertised as having better sound quality and could operate other smart equipment (light bulbs, etc.) Surprisingly to us, the Echo Dot's sound quality was very good - not quite as good as the Plus's, but still very good. So, now, we've bought some additional Echo Dots and enjoy the high quality sound in multiple rooms."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Good start on whole-house Alexa coverage,"Not the best by far for audio quality, but really good for the home automation and assistant features. This is my sixth Alexa device, completing coverage throughout the house. It can listen for glass break or loud noises (like a door being pounded on) and alert me as part of our home security system. I can use it to arm and disarm my Blink cameras, either in the house or from the cellphone Alexa app. It can trigger a series of actions for lights, cameras, etc. in home automation. The ""drop in"" and ""announce"" functions works as a home intercom system. In the kitchen, Alexa is a valuable assistant, timing dishes, doing measure conversions,e tc."
5.0,9 months ago,Argos,Excellent piece of kit,"Excellent little device to transform your standard home into a smart home. We have purchase many compatible wall plugs which have all of our lamps plugged in to, this has made turning on and off the lighting for upstairs and down stairs easier and quicker. You can name each individual plug for turning on/off and then set a group of them into a category such as ""downstairs"" to turn off the whole area under one command. We have also adapted the hive system as well, worth the money!"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great First Alexa Device,"Well I have to say this is a neat little device. Really we could have cared less about getting one but it was a free promotion with something else we bought so here we are. It was a nice surprise to find out that it is compatible already with all the other stuff we have been adding to our house over the last several years - thermostat, security system, smart plugs/bulbs etc. We can tell it to turn on lights, set the heat, set the alarm etc. I think if you have any of that or plan to get any of it then this is a nice compliment to all of that. I think if we didn't have any of that though it wouldn't be very cool by itself. It is a lot of fun and it's very easy to get used to. In fact after a couple weeks using it you find yourself trying to talk to other things you own :) Enjoy."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Alexa knows everything,"This is a great item to purchase for all age groups. You can get details on everything ranging from the weather to the latest sales at your favorite store. The Echo dot now has voice recognition - which is great. Also, it has home guard - which works in conjunction with your smart lights and some home security systems. There is so much to offer to name it all. I haven’t found a negative yet. You won’t regret this purchase."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Alexa is Now Helping Us Around the House,We purchased the first Echo Dot for my youngest son. He quickly had it set up and soon my older son wanted one too. We returned to buy another from Best Buy. It was still on sale for Black Friday. We now have outlets and lights set up around the house connected to this. We are still discovering more and more capabilities from the Echo Dot. This is a helpful device to have around the house.
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Ok I said I wouldn't do the Smart Home product,"I promised that would not do the smart home products especially Google. They are a scary company, however once I got the first Echo Dot I just could not wait to get two more for the house. Ir is so convenient and easy to set up. It syncs with Direct TV and actually works very well. The Fire TV are a little more difficult, but I love the way it keeps my calendar event, reminders, the ease of playing my favorite music. I'm now sold."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great for its size,"SOUND: For such a small device the sound is surprisingly good. It gets loud and sounds decently clear. For a casual music listener you likely won't complain. Keep in mind these are not meant to compete with the Homepod or Sonos One. Stereo pairing sounds better than a single device. FUNCTIONALITY: The speaker is very responsive to ""Alexa."" The two feature I like most are 1) drop-in and 2) Announcements. The drop-in feature allows the user to open communication with another echo device. Announcements act as intercom allowing you to send a message across all echo devices on the network."
5.0,3 weeks ago,Argos,Amazing amazon,"Absolutely love this item, I did some research before purchased and heard nothing but good things, I’m even more amazed now that I have it. The things this speaker can do is amazing. The Alexa feature is brilliant. Worth the money and the money is still a good price. My mum now loves it and wants to create a smart house with me. The echo dot featuring Alexa has converted us to smart home. We love it!"
5.0,7 months ago,Argos,Great communication,Love theses Echo dots have them in all my main rooms and have bought some for my children and grandchildren for their rooms. Music whenever you want ask Alexia anything like having a library in your rooms. Added bonus can use as intercom from room to room Can ask her to dial my sons house and my Grandchildren’s rooms too. No fumbling for your phone when at home just ask Alexa to call for you. Misplace your phone in house ask Alexa to call it. buy one and I am sure you will buy a second.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Nice little speaker,"The speaker can be pretty loud in a small room. It was my first attempt at anything smart home related. I had stumbled onto some smart plug surge protectors and this worked perfectly with them. After that I got some smart bulbs and a stand alone smart plug. All work great. I set up a routine in the Alexa app for turning everything on (Alexa, turn on my stuff) and another for turning it all off (Alexa, goodbye)."
5.0,7 months ago,Argos,Love it!,I purchased this Amazon Dot for my grandaughters 12th birthday as she loves my Amazon Echo and wanted one for her bedroom to listen to music and help with her homework! The sound is great and does everything my Echo does. She enjoys the games and quizzes and her younger sister (5) also enjoys asking Alexa questions and playing guessing games too. The Alexa app also allows her parents to monitor what is being used for piece of mind. Really pleased with purchase & would recommend.
5.0,8 months ago,Argos,I have three of these things now,"I now have an Echo Dot in my kitchen, bedroom and living room. Using the Alexa app i have set them up as multi-room audio for Spotify so i can play in individual rooms, everywhere, or any combination of two of the three. I've got Alexa controlled bulbs in my rooms and lamps, and a couple of Alexa controlled sockets. I just wander around talking to myself instead of flicking switches on and off. ""Alexa i'm going to work"" activates a routine that turns off the music and all the lights."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great for music and lights,"Never really thought we would use one of these but over time I find that we have music playing in the background of game nights and dinner and we've started adding lighting control. This was actually really fun at Christmas time as we added a couple more wireless controllers to the decorations. And the family actually likes to play Jeopardy after supper. Sometimes do worry about the whole ""big brother is listening"" thing but my phone does that just as much so ."
5.0,3 weeks ago,Argos,More than just a bedside clock,"Bought this initially as just a bedside clock and first step into smart speakers. Quickly gone past the usual things like asking about weather, traffic etc and now moved on to linking smart plugs that are now situated in hard to reach places. Alexa makes switching these on far more easier and can also do this remotely over the app on my phone. Excellent bit of kit and finding more about Alexa knows every day. Easy to set up, even for me at 68."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Love my Alexa,"I have 3 of the Echos and love them. They are so smart and I use them as an intercom. I have only one complaint and that is they weren't that easy to get the devices to work like you want them too. I know it is me but I believe the instructions could be a little better in explaining how to correct problems. For example, I can tell Alexa to play music and it plays in another room. It does this sometimes when you tell it which room you want the music played in. They are very smart and I use them for more tasks all the time. They come in very handy as a timer in the kitchen. My granddaughter gave me my first one as a Christmas present when they first came out and I didn't know what it was. I thought it was some kind of hockey puck. I am an old geezer but I love having them around. I would absolutely recommend them to a friend.Less"
5.0,a month ago,influenster.com,"I absolutely love my Alexa! I mainly use mine for music. I also use as a timer for cooking. I can set multiple times as needed. Occasionally she misunderstands me and plays the wrong playlist. Alexa is actually really affordable for what you get. I do wish that prime members got the music unlimited for free though. Overall, we have two Alexa's and I will be sticking with them.","I absolutely love my Alexa! I mainly use mine for music. I also use as a timer for cooking. I can set multiple times as needed.

2.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,No security on these little Echos,Does not have an option to connect to a WPA2 wireless network. Anyone with a Bluetooth connection can also hook to them without your knowledge. I had a neighbor who kept connecting their phone to my first/second gen Dot via the bluetooth and this 3nd gen appears to have the same issue. I did not have that issue with the regular size Echo. Stick with the regular Echos if you want an Echo. Their security is much better.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great addition to your Amazon Prime Account,"For Christmas I was given a second generation Echo Dot. After setting it up and using it I wanted a few more for the house. I decided to get two of the third generation Echo Dots. The sound is better than the second generation and a bit bigger in size. These are easy set up with an app you use on your cell phone. The Echo Dot is a great addition to your Amazon Prime Account. There are so many things this device will do, play music, soothing sounds, alarms, notifications, get you weather and other information. Love this device and highly recommend it."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Good upgrade in speaker quality from 1st Gen,"Got this free with a Ring home security purchase so price was great. This is a good upgrade in speaker quality from the 1st Gen I had. Item looks good, sounds good and works as it should. Any complaints would be software and not hardware related. If you wanting to get into trying out Alexa in your home this is a great affordable option that will allow you to try it out without spending a lot of money."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Echo dot is stylish and easy to use.,I brought the echo dot as a birthday present for my wife and she absolutely loves it. It was the easiest bit of technology to set up plus the sheer size and style it has would match the decor of any household. My wife loves the sound range on this but for me I would have liked it to be a little louder (but i do like loud music). I had great customer service when i brought the echo dot and was great value for money considering it is one of the latest models. Very happy with the purchase.
5.0,8 months ago,Argos,"A must have, very good price as well!","Product is small and very compact. You can even hide it somewhere in the room if you fancy! It has a very attractive and modern design, very easy to install. The quality of sound is superb, responds to whatever you ask without any delays at all as well. And the price?!?! Spot on!! I suggest this product to everyone!! A must have for entertainment and music lovers like me! Come on! You can even listen to radio with it! Am planning on using it for other things in the future!"
4.0,2 weeks ago,Argos,My 11 year old requested one for his birthday,My son originally wanted an alarm clock and he saw this with the the speaker and Alexa. It’s linked to our Spotify account so he can listen to music in his room now he’s getting a bit older. Sound quality is perfect for a bedroom. He’s also found Alexa useful for finding out random things. Looks stylish too and gives off a nice light. Would recommend this product.
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Great for the kitchen,"Very pleased with this. Gives off much better sound quality & not so annoying as the old radio the hubby used to listen to his sport. Very useful too for asking Alexa quick questions or cooking tips. Occasionally it does take a couple of attempts to get Alexa to function or understand what you're asking. The only annoying thing is that you have to download the app on your phone in order to set it up, or solve problems; which is fine if you have a lot of memory on your phone."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great little device,"Prior to buying one of these for my mom for Christmas I didn’t have any desire to own one for myself. After setting hers up and reading what it can actually do I have to admit I was impressed so I went and got myself one and I really love it. My only gripe is the potential privacy concerns since this is basically a “hot mic” that needs to be left on If you always want it to work correctly but then again in this day and age if someone has the skills to do something nefarious like hack or listen in, they will do it anyway with the other electronics in your home like the tv or computer cam etc... you get the point!"
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Upgraded Sound,"I had 5 echo dots (2nd Gen) throughout the house and used them for just about everything. I came across a deal that the more you buy the more you save. I got 5 of the 3rd gens and couldn't be happier. Better sound, better range, and better understanding. I paid about $18 per unit and sold my 2nd gens for $100. I was able to upgrade for just about nothing. These are the best sounding echo dots to date. Grab a few, they do just about everything you could want them to."
5.0,4 months ago,ebay.com,Fantastic,"Ive added this echo to my home setup echo plus. I find myself using Alexa more and more as time passes, its great lying in bed just telling Alexa to switch the kettle on (WiFi plug required) My kids absolutely love it too, my 4 year old has endless fun asking silly questions or asking her to sing different songs. Alexa recognises what song shes asking for with a random line from the song. All in all an excellent piece of kit, Ill definitely add a few more of them around home!"
4.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Got this free with Ring Video Doorbell Pro,"Sound and build quality are great and integrates well with my Nest thermostats. Gave it 4 stars because there isn’t an easy way to ask Alexa to play from your music collection. All of my music is on google music and Amazon no longer allows you to upload your own music to its cloud. It also cannot access Google music. Unless you pair your phone with it, I couldn’t find a simple way to ask Alexa to play a particular song in your collection."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great deal,"One day I wanted to meet Alexa at my home and made fast decision when I saw a great price for Echo dot. I bought online and picked it up at the store and before leaving I found another device with clock. There was last one, so in 1 minute I replaced my first one. Since this moment I knew this is it. My Alexa helps me control the lights, TV and time. This version with display is really cool, you do not need any different clock at home."
5.0,3 months ago,Argos,Fabulous addition to our bedroom,"After many years if use it was time to upgrade our Sony dream machine radio alarm. The sound quality is great on our new echo dot and the alarm sets with ease. I can even play relaxing music to go to sleep to and instruct it to go off after ten minutes. Sheer genius. The only down side is you cannot set the alarm to play BBC radio, however you can get round this by just asking Alexa to play the radio station when the alarm sounds."
4.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Great source of information,"I love having Alexa in my home. The ease of obtaining information is amazing. No laptop or phone needed, just the sound of your voice. There are still questions that may not be answered, but more information and skills are being added daily. I love the 'drop in' function and placing orders on items I've purchased previously. We have the Dot in our bedroom and I wake each morning to hear a weather report and the latest news. Great technology!"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Better than the second and first generation,"I've owned multiple smart speakers in the past including the Google home mini and the previous versions of the dot. I can say for a fact that this third generation echo dot has definitely gotten better in terms of voice recognition and sound quality. With the first and second generation versions of this product, I had to tell to triiger the Alexa voice assistant when I was far from the speaker. However, now that is no longer the case."
5.0,10 months ago,Argos,Fantastic Personal Assistant,"Bought this to replace my old one which I took to my office. Useful for all sorts of daily things such as listening to the radio, getting the weather forecast, listening to pod casts, getting information such as cinema listings, local events and travel reports, creating shopping and to-do lists. I'm only scratching the surface, there's loads more it can do. I can also communicate with my office so both I and my team can work while talking hands free. Can't wait to see what else it's capable of."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Love this product,"Bought this as an upgrade to the 2nd generation echo dot only because I wanted a clock on the device! I don’t have to set multiple alarms now because there is a snooze function! I can see my alarms and timers on the screen! This is an awesome upgrade! I would have bought on amazon, but there was a wait time at the time of Jan 2020 now it’s well into Feb 2020 and I’ve had this for 3 weeks and I’d recommend! I always overslept because I didn’t see the time when the alarm would go off on my echo dot 2nd gen!"
5.0,a month ago,influenster.com,"I love having Alexa in the house. It’s priced so reasonable. I use it for so many things; creating grocery lists, playing music, asking questions, communicating with my smart plug (during Christmas I would say “Alexa turn on the Christmas lights” and then it would), and so much more. It lets me know when my amazon orders arrived. I can also tell it to vacuum and then my robot vacuum will start up. There’s so many more things I have to learn about the device but I use it for so much and it’s very convenient.","I love having Alexa in the house. It’s priced so reasonable.

4.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Fun to use,The Echo Dot came free with a Sony TV I bought. The TV has the Google assistant so I didn't really need this. I gave it to my Mom to use in her kitchen. It's very handy for setting timers and making shopping lists that you can see in the app. It also works good for streaming music. We all have fun asking it to tell us jokes too. I plan on installing a few Wi-Fi switches so she can use it to turn some lights on and off. It's well designed and fun to use. Definitely happy with it!
2.0,a month ago,Best Buy,"Sounds better than previous generations, slow wake","The sound quality is much better than the previous two generations. I have tried 4 of these units. My only complaint is the wake (when you say alexa) response time is slower. When setting it next to a Sonos One, Echo Show 1st &\or 2nd Gen, or 2nd Gen Dot, it wakes like a couple seconds behind the others. I would buy for sound quality however I prefer the 2nd generation dot for speed of the wake for command."
5.0,7 months ago,Argos,Amazing sound,Should have bought one ages ago. Best buy ive ever bought. Sound is quality can play all radio stations. Amazon music is also brilliant better than others ive had. Easy to set up if i can do it as not tech savvy but easy to follow set up instructions. It may be small but the sound as it says echos brilliant. Color grey heather is nice matches my decor. A must buy if looking for an alexa product buy this.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great device to help control smart home devices.,"Besides telling jokes and ordering products on Amazon, the Echo Dot makes a great smart home hub. Alexa has no issues with my voice or even my wife's, who has a slight accent. Using the Dot, I control multiple light switches with it through my voice and integrations with the skills. My wife also likes to check the weather before venturing out for the day. With two of these we have also set up an intercom between rooms. The only negative side is registering the device with a single account, instead of allowing multiple accounts use on the device with unlock pass codes. I recommend the Echo Dot for anyone with Amazon Prime or those setting up smart devices in their home."
5.0,8 months ago,Argos,Amazon echo dot made a great gift,"I bought this as a gift, didn't want to spend more money on the bigger one incase it wasn't used. The gift went down really well and was easy enough to set up. Im impressed with the sound volume and quality and all the different features. It gets used most days for different things and was well worth the money. The design is nice too and it looks really neat. Would recommend to anyone as there is so much you can do with it."
5.0,3 months ago,Argos,"Brillaint, with amazon music=any song frm any tme!","So simple to install and easy to use - Pair with Amazon music, 2 million songs included with prime membership or 3.99 a month for 50 million any song from any time! Just ask and it plays!. Can pay more for downloading or family share. You can also get plugs to control other things, we got Teckin smart plugs wifi, 4 plugs about £30. You can control the plugs from anywhere via mobile app, turn on lamps etc when not at home."
5.0,11 months ago,Argos,Revolutionised music and info listening,"Love this thing. No more faffing to plsy the radio or good music on your phone in the am. Using meditation, relaxation and bedime story apps is great. Few hisses on her voice on one occssion and the inconsistency of understanding commands at times. Eg ssk her where sre we snd you get accurate location., then ask her the weather in said location and shes way off? Wont look bsck though until have to start psyimg monthly for amazon music."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,good for smart home. good for apple music user,"just picked up a couple of these because of the addition of apple music. i like the homepod but the price is steep for what it offers. Alexa is still the most ""smartest"" of the 3, google, alexa and siri. echo dot being able to use spotify(which ive grown to dislike), amazon music(i have amazon prime) and apple music(the selection and curation is much better than spotify IMO) alexa as a smarthome assistant works great, works with my sony TV, lutron caseta system, door bell and security camera system. I wish Apple could improve their homekit support with hardware.. they are getting left in the dust.. i have a google home mini and i disconnected it.. kept activating for some reason without anyone clearly saying ok google.. and that scared me.. i should put into recycling.."
3.0,a month ago,Argos,Echo dot set up,All those who use technology as a matter of course should have no problems. However. For those of us for whom it isn't intuitive setting it up was a painful process. No instructions given.Need to ensure you have an Amazon account first. Not clear what you can do that is free and what charges are if you want more flexibility. Once set up.... Finally. We found the sound was very good and it was unobtrusive which is great and no speakers and wires to sort out.
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Tool for Studying,"I use the Echo Dot with my studying, When I get to a word I cannot pronounce and/or define I ask Alexis. Sometimes it does not understand my speech or the way I phrased the question. So, it forces me to try my question again or to phrase it differently, which is a good way of learning too. It makes me enunciate my words better and think of multiple ways to ask the same thing. My husband bought the tower version for the family room, which we don't use all its features. So, when Christmas came he bought me this Echo Dot version for my study room and it works the same way. Since the Echo Dot is reasonably priced, I since have purchased one for my granddaughter and one my mother-in-law. Love it!"
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Really smart device in looks and operation!,"I did not have high hopes for this device but I, and the family, are really pleased with what it can do. Two things are most impressive: First, is the speed with which requests are carried out. Second, the variety of things which can be asked of Alexa. It is astonishing! For such a clever device, the cost was very low making for very good value for money. The device makes an excellent and affordable present for friends and family."
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,These little things are awesome,People say they listen to you on these things...blah blah blah. I carry an iPhone every where I go. If they really cared what I had to say they would listen through that..and they probably are anyway. So as for these echos dots... I own 3 of them and I love them. I have amazon music and I can play music through out the house. Sound quality is great for how cheap these are. Every feature that these things have are super convenient and easy to take advantage of.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Amazon Dot gen 3 is awesome,"My wife bought me a single white gen 3 dot for Christmas. When she mentioned it to me, I didn't think much about it and thought cool ... I'll look into it I guess. Since getting it for Christmas, I loved it so much I bought an Echo plus, and 2 of these charcoal dots. I use one of these in the kids room and the other in our office. I like that each dot, depending on the room it is assigned to, can quickly control the immediate devices in that room, as well as other devices assigned to other rooms."
5.0,10 months ago,Argos,A great upgrade to the Echo Dot product,This is an additional Echo Dot to our household and I am delighted with how the product has improved in the last couple of years. The sound quality is now actually very good for a speaker of its size with a surprising amount of bass available. Unlike the previous versions music now sounds pretty good.The micxrophones appear more sensitive and able to discern the wake up command even when other noises are present. One tiny niggle is that the feedback from the lighting ring is a little slower.
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Great bit of kit,"I’ve avoided all Alexa products until I got vouchers for Xmas so thought I’d give it a try. Yes it feels strange talking to yourself at the start, now it’s second nature. I don’t use it to it’s full potential yet, I’m still learning but I’ve been able to ask basic questions and linked it to my Audible account so I can listen to my books. Audio quality is pretty good and the neat little design so it doesn’t take up too much space. Would happily buy another to use in the kitchen."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Took Google Home Mini back,"I purchased one for my living room. It got nonstop usage for over two weeks. My kids were in love with it. My teenage nephew even took it in his room a few times to use it. So I got him one for Christmas. My kids got a Google Home Mini from a family member. But it proved to be too difficult for a 4 and 6 year old to operate. It required too many apps to operate the same way the Echo does. I dont like having too many subscriptions. And the Home Mini required just that. So we exchanged it for another Amazon Echo. Easy set up. Easy to set routines for my kids like bedtime and alarm setting. I also like the Parent Mode that controls what they can listen to. No need for the kids version Echo. This works just fine. They can also call me when Im out, no phone required. Im gonna regret that later lol. But its a nice feature as I dont want them to have cell phones at this age. Sound quality is just as good as a house phone. It has a nice modern, simplistic style. Everyone loves it. The Google Home Mini was much harder to set up on the app. The customization on the Home Mini was much more complicated. I found myself downloading more and more apps, just to make it function. All the apps I have for my Echo is Tidal for music, and Amazon Alexa. We’re up to 3 Echos. I’ll get another one when we get a bigger house lol. But maybe one more wont hurt. I recommend this for anybody. Kids as well.Less"

No need for the cable or Bluetooth but via my WIFI. Nice and easy to install with the clear to follow instructions. Was also surprised at the level of volume and clarity of sound when just using the speaker by itself, especially from such a small unit. So many more features yet to discover. Totally satisfied with this and the price and service from Screwfix."

When the alarm turns on, I was able to speak and disable right away but suddenly, now when it turns on I need to press the bottom to turn it off because when I speak it does nothing. Anyway, I will take my chances and give it another try to this new device I just got...... could it be maybe the 1st Echo I got got any internal issue?? we'll see"
4.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Useful product addition to the 4 we already use,"Our Echo and Echo Dots serve the family well. They are useful as intercoms and ready sources of information, reminders, and timers. We also use them with our Sirius XM all access, Amazon music, and as ""radios."" The sound quality is very good for the price. The convenience is worth it. The most recent purchase was to have a ""portable"" to use on the deck, down the cellar or in the garage."

Can handle some general knowledge questions. I'm still learning how to use it. Cons: Always having to check it has heard me. Can't play some music I like. doesn't always stop when I tell it to. It drives me nuts with ' Hmm...I don't know the answer to that' I want to scream 'go and look it up' Not too sure if it is listening all the time."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Great multi function speaker,This has been a great purchase and links up with so many devices and is multi-functional. Was cheaper than other standard Bluetooth speakers so I got two. Can’t wait for the summer and can have music with our BBQ’s. Easy to set up. Have also got them set up with my Mac as Bluetooth speakers on a midi setup. Also working great with a range of led light brands purchased elsewhere.

Amazon only allowed two to be purchased at a time but Argos had no limit which was great!"

Old Dot far field mic works easily from adjacent room but the new one you have to stand next to it and talk very loudly, almost shout.

5.0,a month ago,Argos,My echo dot,"Totally awesome, connects to my mobile phone tablet and acts as a bluetooth speaker. Links with music accounts and you can have fun quiz games with your kids. Multi room function for sending messages around the home and if you only got the one you can unplug and up running again once you connect the power no lag time. Responds to voice commands easily and comes with an app for your phone to aid connectivity with devices."
4.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Quirky,"Much better than the original pucks; but Alexa still has a long way to go before she fully understands what the heck you're asking. I'm not reviewing Alexa though. This system is far superior to our old dots; but still isn't perfect. The sound is much more clear and the distance at which is can detect your voice is better as well. I can't wait for the next generation. Meets, but does not exceed, my expectations."
1.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Ok but did will not work as a speaker phone.,"It does everything it says it will do except what I bought it for. It states that you can pair your phone to it. What it does not tell you is that you can only play music from your phone. You can not make or receive phone calls like you are able to from any other ""dumb"" Bluetooth speaker. So I guess I ended up with a $30 dollar radio. Now the customer support stated that that feature may be added in the future. So I use it as my I Heart radio. If it would work as a speaker phone I would have given it 5 stars."

5.0,6 months ago,Argos,Tiny device very loud,I got the Echo dot for my daughters 6th Birthday her school has one and she liked telling it to make poop noises.. sold me when she said she can listen to books too.. Easy to set up with my audiable. Its very easy to use and set up and for such a small device it’s very loud. My daughter likes listening to the radio to on their too so very handy. Thinking we may get another for the kitchen. Managed to get for sale price so very good value for money would definitely recommend.
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Excellent hands-free source for music & info,"The sound quality of this Echo Dot is incredible for its size. I use one like a clock radio, setting a wake-up time, and telling it to stop playing in 20 minutes while I'm falling asleep. It's also great to just ask for news or weather. You don't even need any paid services (such as Amazon Prime Music). I just use Pandora (free) and it provides great music according to my preferences. Really, this IS the best thing since sliced bread!"
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Great device at a great price.,"Got 3 Dots for Xmas presents all were gratefully received! Very easy to set up Mum was delighted as once she had set up her Amazon account to the Dot Alexa can read her audio books! Great you can get Alexa to send messages, make lists, reminders, play the radio, plays general era/genre music, tells jokes, tells you where local places are, the weather, the list goes on! Very cleaver little device, good sound and looks neat and compact too!"
5.0,4 months ago,very.co.uk,does the job,i bought 3 of these to put all around my house and now there is no more shouting. i recently started my own business and as a result of me not being around as much things like the kids homework is going undone and we run out of things because nobody remembers to say oh we need this. alexa now reminds us of all the things we need to do when we need to do them. the kids can have music in their own rooms and no more running up and down the stairs to tell them things. i just have alexa tell them.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Fun product,This was our first smart device in the home and it has been fun to use. We purchased the Dot along with an Amazon Firestick and the smart plug. It has been a fun device to have in the home with these other devices. My nine year old is enjoying having the ability to ask Alexa to play his shows on Netflix and to call Grandma. The alarm capability as well as the clock are definitely nice features as well.

But now we have installed Alexa,, (which has been renamed to one she can remember) mum just has to ask her and like magic she answers most of her questions asked. She also loves just asking for her favourite music Cons: Trying to set up without a mob or laptop/tablet"
5.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Great product,This is my first echo. I purchased 2 of them because they were on sale. I mostly use them to play music from Amazon. I figured out you can set wake up alarm too. I have it to do week day only alarm to wake the kids up for school. The sound quality decent for music and loud enough for single room. Has an auxiliary connect to be able to connect to bigger speakers. Very convenient at my bed side.
5.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Excellent voice recognition,"Seems as if this generation is quicker to respond and had better voice recognition. I got this free with a purchase, so I replaced my first generation echo speaker. I must say it picks up on my voice and recognizes my commands much better than the previous versions. I do see an overall improvement and am satisfied with the performance. It turns my lights on and off and does what I need it to do."
4.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Who needs to leave the couch now?,"Fairly easy to set up. Works like a charm on my smart plugs, wifi light bulbs, and TV. Not a great speaker for just playing music, but given size and price, that should be expected. The only real negative to me, was if you want to change wifi connections, it is not intuitive at all. Kind of a pain. I also have a Google Home speaker and it difficult to change wifi connections as well. You'd figure that process would be intuitive and easy, but not at all."
5.0,2 months ago,Target,Awesome gift!,"I decided to treat myself for Christmas... This is awesome! My kids and I have so much fun playing games and asking her questions. I also ordered a smart light bulb from another website to go with it and it has been so helpful when putting my kids to bed. I also like being able to set alarms, ""find my phone"", track Santa, listen to music (this little thing sound pretty good fir as small as it is!).... There are so many functions it will take forever to learn them all."
4.0,5 months ago,Argos,Great product!,"I purchased this primarily to set reminders for my elderly parents and to make it easier for them to access their favourite music. It was very easy for me to set up for them and it does the job very well. Alexa is extremely helpful and a good deal for the price. The one thing I would say is that if you're looking to connect to Spotify you do need to have Spotify premium, and once connected I had to unplug and plug the echo dot before it connected correctly. Otherwise fantastic product!"
5.0,10 months ago,Argos,Echo Dot - almost lost for words it's that good,"What can I say... Small foot print, big sound! Aesthetically pleasing It punches well above it's weight in design, quality & value for money. This device is perfect for you if you use subscription music, house automation, reminders, alarms, video surveillance, nest heating. It's linked technically to the Amazon infrastructure, so the quality and reliability of service is second to none. So good we have one in each room in our house!"
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Great Little Entertainment Speaker,"I bought one of these to try it out and was having so much fun with it that I went back to buy another one. It was easy to set up the first one and even easier to set up the second one. I subscribed to the Unlimited Music app and it is great. One subscription works for both of them. While I'm working or just relaxing I can tell Alexa to play a certain song or a shuffle of songs by artist, year or category and I can even have the same song playing on both at the same time."
3.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Alexa Not as Good as Google. But...,"Over the years I’ve done quite a few videos showing how Google smart speakers are far better than Alexa. Maybe some day Amazon will catch on to their issues. BUT! I decided to get the new Echo Dot with the time display to put on the other side of the bed. Great sound, and the display adapts changes to the amount of light within the room, brighter in the day light, dimmed at night so the ‘blue light’ doesn’t bother your eyes while sleeping."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Keeps getting better and better,"Have you ever thought about how close we are to the future portrayed in Star Trek? Their communicators? Our cell phones. Medical imaging? Check. Turn in reports on tablets? Ditto. All hundreds of years ahead of time. But the best is when someone would enter a room and call out ""Computer. What is the current status"" of something or other? Or ask for music? Etc. This is almost there. I have several Dots and their Echo hub to handle other smart devices. It is an easy setup. To get started, you will need a (free) Amazon account, a smart phone and wifi. Bought the first one for an elderly parent for help in answering and making phone calls. Turn off and on lights. Worked great. I now have several scattered around the house plus the version built into the 2 new Toshiba Fire TV's purchased from Best Buy. Also controls a Nest thermostat. But it all started with a single Dot. This 3rd generation looks and sounds a little better than the last model but is pretty much the same. And watch for special pricing - I paid $25 for this 3rd generation model. What do you have to lose by trying it? Still some issues in being fully implemented but getting better all the time. Besides updates, Alexa learns from how you use it. Do you NEED it? No. But did we need cars instead of horses? Jets over propeller airplanes? This is part of an interesting future. Hop on and enjoy. Still no sign of food replicators yet, unfortunately.Less"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Ohhhh Alexa,"Such a simple device that can do so much. We have four in our home, and I use one at work to play music. I find myself, along with other coworkers, blabbing to Alexa or asking her ridiculous things, most of which she has an answer for. My only gripe is I can’t name her whatever I want. But the device works great, and sound quality is fine enough to stream music all day long, or easily play my apple music via bluetooth. Go ahead and get the smart outlets to control lights or lamps or whatever you fancy. Connected to our nest thermostat, our garage door opener, camera system, maybe more. Alexa can do it all!"
5.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,3rd Gen is the charm,I purchased the 1st generation of the echo dot and have been relatively happy with it. I really like what they have done with the 3rd generation. It looks nice and blends in better with a home. The rounded shape is also more pleasing visually than the first 2 versions. Our house isn't very big but we have 4 echos stationed throughout. The echo dot as a standalone unit works great in the bathrooms at home.

4.0,a month ago,Argos,Daughters Alexa xmas present,My daughter loved this for xmas. But wasnt too easy to set up for her. Until I had a go and managed to figure it out. My youngest loves talking to Alexa and getting her to play songs. Easy to move around the house if u need to. Quite loud and easy to use. Unless you live in an area that isnt too good with wifi signal all the time. Like us where it keeps going on and off. Good buy as a last minute gift
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,A step back but still worth its price,"Even though it’s speaker has improved, I have the Dot connected to an external speaker for better music playback. It’s great. Why the step back? Well it seems that this girl is hard of hearing. I find myself asking Alexa multiple times before she hears me. My previous Dot didn’t have this problem. I’ve positioned it in different angles and locations but still not having success. Small annoyance for me but others may not feel the same way. Regardless, I still feel this is the best Echo device for those who have external speakers to connect it to (Echo Input to much $$ for what it offers or doesn’t)."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,First Echo Dot,"I can only review this as a first time user with this type device. I've had it a couple weeks now and it is really a fun thing to have around. It was easy to set up, and thus far has worked well. I purchased a few smart light switches and plugs. They, on the other hand, were a little trickier to get going, but ;ike everything tech, got easy after the first connect. Connecting the plugs and switches to the wifi took a try or two, but connecting them to the Dot was simple. The speaker is a little muffled, but not bad. The Dot can hear you without having to turn the TV down, or sushing other conversations. So far, I am happy with this purchase."
1.0,a month ago,Best Buy,DON'T BUY THE ECHO DOT,"My Echo Dot ONLY listens to me when it apparently suits the device, oddly enough if there's a movie/show on & someone says ""Alexa"" she will light up, which is more than what she does for me. Half the time when I ask her to play a song & she will announce playing & the devices lights keeps spinning around & eventually it won't play anything at all. I'm convinced mine is possessed, which serves me right being I swore I'd never buy one. I should've stuck to it because now the device is stored away in the hall closet, it's ashame being I've had it less than a month."
5.0,5 days ago,Best Buy,"Works well, looks nice","I like these, pretty unobtrusive. Mic picks up all voices very well, they look nice but are not obvious. Adding devices is a little challenging. Other Echo products auto ""locate"" work fine, searching for anything else usually results in ""can't find"" but they add anyway after a few tries. Suspect this is more an APP issue. Once added & connected though, love the features & ease of use."
5.0,2 weeks ago,Argos,Great bedroom clock and music system,Great little product with all the benefits of an Echo dot plus a clock display making it perfect for a bedside table. Display brightens or dims depending on light conditions so great for getting to sleep. Compact size frees up loads of room from a traditional clock radio especially if it a docking station too. Linked to the echo downstairs so can have music everywhere as well as send messages
5.0,6 months ago,ebay.com,A must have for every home.,I was a bit sceptical about buying the alexa dot. I wasn't sure about the sound quality or if it would play my Apple Music. I found one at a great price and decided to go for it. I'm not disappointed. Set up took a matter of minutes. It plays my Apple Music and the sound isn't bad at all. It's even better when connected via bluetooth to my TV's surround sound. We're still experimenting with it but we plan to buy the Echo and Spots next to enable multi room and video calling.
3.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Improved but not across the board,"After experiencing all voice assistance devices (Siri, Google, Alexa), I definitely decided that Alexa is far more advanced than the competition for my needs. After 4 Alexa devices in my home, I decided to give it a try to the new generation and bought 2 additional devices. Pros: Amazing improvement on the sound, higher volume and more clear notes. Cons: It is difficult to listen to me, sometimes fail to hear the wake up word or to understand the request, which didn't happen in the previous gen."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great work made simple,Really I would give this a 4.5. It has excellent abilities but still has a bit of trouble understanding what you say. It also reacts to all the comercials on TV and out of the blue with some really strange things. That being said I like the way google responds you have to say hey google to wake it up and it has more of a repitoire than alexa. I have these in every room and have all my home as a smart home. Alexa controls the whole house and it can be done from anywhere. I also have sent a dot to my grandkids and we can talk whenever they like. I need to get them a screen but cannot see spending 200.00 and then they break it. I love it and would recommend it to everyone
4.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,great intro into the world of Alexa,My Echo Dot was part of a bundle purchase so it was basically free to me. I was already an Amazon Prime member who uses Prime Music. Sound quality is very good for such a small device. Only negative is that the Echo Dot has to be plugged in at all times. It does not have a rechargeable battery so not quite as portable as I originally thought. Looking forward to learning more ways to use my new Dot.
5.0,3 months ago,bestbuy.ca,Do it. Fun little machine. Get it when on sale!!,"Great little machine. Love it for it's bluetooth connectivity. I have it set up with my home audio receiver and use my streaming music apps on my phone through bluetooth. Responsive. Attractive. Great sound on it's own as a speaker. Great for connecting to Amazon music on it's own as well. Easy set up, decent price and easy to use."
4.0,2 weeks ago,staples.com,Echo Dot 3 with clock,"Purchased to replace a clock radio. Works and sounds great. Easy to set up with an I-phone app. The only change I would make is the ability to dim or turn off the ""light ring"" at night. I personally am not concerned about the privacy issue but you can mute the mic with a button on top. That still doesn't mean they can't listen, just like leaving a cell phone out. You just have to be aware if you have these units in your house."
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Alexa = friend,Love Echo Dots..this makes 4th one I have in my house. Turn on a basement lamp as soon as I walk in the door until I can reach the light switch for main basement lights. Use for all the other lamps in my house too. Say Good Morning everyday & get a fact for the day & sometimes little “extras” that she tells me to ask for. Say Good Night every night & she responds...4 usual random responses. Faster than Google-I just ask her about something & she quickly gets the answer & tells me.
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Excellent for a lazy guy like me,"This speaker has become so relied upon in my house, it’s crazy. The microphone sensitivity is perfect. I say Alexa, at a regular conversation tone, and it picks it up. I use it to turn off the lights, turn on the tv, my Xbox, the freaking coffee maker! Lol If you want your parents to comment on how you’re spending your money on “ frivolous toys” when they come to visit, Get this and the Hue lights. It’s too funny"
5.0,8 months ago,Argos,Love my Dot,"I have an Echo already, but wanted the Dot for my kitchen. It's brilliant. I can enjoy music without straining to hear the Echo situated in the lounge. I can link to play the same or individual if tv is being used. I have previously bought two of these for presents so if that isn't a recommendation, I don't know what is. They are the Best Buy I have made, and I wouldn't be without either. My son and family, and my daughter and family would agree and they are constantly in use."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Much better than the previous gen,"I was skeptical about getting another echo, mainly because the older version had a hard time hearing me. Same with my google mini. The speaker on this is far superior than the past. A little more bass helps a lot. The interface hasn't changed much. It still has a little hard time picking up my voice but I have a lot background noise. Overall a great improvement."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Amazing,"This device is amazing. I was unsure at first about the sound quality being a small device. But once set up, which was straight forward after downloading the Alexa app. The sound quality is amazing. The sound seems to follow you around the room. Will definitely be buying more now for other rooms in the house. Highly recommend the Dot. And great value for money"
4.0,a month ago,Argos,Fab Alexa,"Got this in a sale and then with £5 off voucher too, so it was a complete bargain. Easy to use, most definitely. I love being able to listen to music at a command and the quality of sound is good. Sometimes there is a vibration sound when it plays, even though there is nothing near it to vibrate, so I just adjust the volume and it is fine. It's not often there, so don't notice it a lot. Otherwise it is great! Really happy with my purchase, thank you!"

Price point is super competitive! One of my favorite purchases for sure !!"

I'm really blown away with the quality of sound of the speakers, Alexa is very responsive and fast in its interaction with you. I originally bought two. This is my first Echo 3 dot. I was so impressed I went back to the store and bought two more. The price was also great, I'm surprised it didn't cost more. I highly recommend this product, you won't be disappointed."
5.0,10 months ago,Argos,Brilliant product,"Excellent value for money for a product which has so many features. Not only does it look great, the sound quality is also brilliant considering the size. We use this to check the weather, play music/radio, play games and much more. The initial set-up takes minutes meaning you're good to go straight away! It took less than a week for us to purchase another so we have one upstairs and downstairs - very handy device."
4.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,"Better than second generation, except . . .","The sound is better. The fabric cover looks nice. The one problem is some auxiliary manufacturers have made devices like clocks that allow the dot to fit inside and work together, but they'll only connect with 2nd generation Dots. This third generation has eliminated that option. I wish Amazon would once again give their Dots the flexibility to work with more devices."
5.0,2 months ago,Target,great item for $22,I bought the last one of these in store and I really like it. works very well pretty easy to set up and does a whole ton of things. The best part which I did not know prior to buying is that the Echo Dot is the only echo that can be compatible with other Bluetooth wireless speakers. So therefore even though this does not put out the best sound or bass you can pair it with other Bluetooth speakers of better quality and have a really great system
5.0,6 months ago,Argos,Great little gadget,I finally succumbed and bought an Echo Dot. Have to say the design and sound quality are great. It was easy to set up and easy to use. Only downside if you want music on demand is that you have to subscribe to Amazon Music. It will also only accept Spotify Premium accounts. Normal radio channels are obviously free. Really glad I bought one now and have bought another for my daughter.
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Upgrade to the original dot. Much improved.,"Much improved echo dot. Design has improved over the original. Bass is very much improved as is the overall sound quality. However, the bass is a bit too much when Alexa talks. I’ve not figured out how to change this yet! Altering the sound settings for the dot but this doesn’t seem to affect the bass for Alexa. Getting this on offer as well was a great deal!"

5.0,10 months ago,ebay.com,The new 3rd Generation Amazon echo dot seems to be the best so far,I do like the the New Amazon 3rd Generation Echo Dot. A Big Plus for the Echo dot as it does have better Sound quality than google assistant. The Echo Dot has cool lights on top and looks really good at night. I find that Alexa is not as intuitive as Google Assistant. It is a good device and I am very happy with my Alexa Echo Dot. Alexa assists well with my Amazon 4k voice assisted Firestick.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Good for running home systems,"EZ 2 set up. I have a total of four Dots and love to have them playing the same music at the same time. To have different music playing on different Dots does require an additional membership with Amazon. The alarm system is fun to use. I have us waking up to different music every day. Since it's the holiday season, I select holiday songs."
4.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Make things hands free around the house,"Overall it lives up to expectations that you see on tv or at your friends house about what an Alexa device can do. They work the lights and plays music for us from spotify. We like that when we are occupied with cooking or taking care of chores around the house, its worth the extra to have it do things for you. It’s not as intelligent though as initially thought in terms of how well it understands you due to the functionality limitations. Supposedly that list of possibilities are growing over time though."
5.0,7 months ago,Argos,In place of a broken CD player,"We bought this product because our CD player was broken. It has transformed the way we listen to music and is hugely beneficial to my wife in particular as she has poor eyesight. Instead of reading the names of tracks on CD covers, my wife simply asks for the track or artist she wishes to listen to. The sound quality is very good and the Echo Dot takes up very little space. We are very pleased with this purchase."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Awesome product for home automation,I was leery about having one of these in the house but then I realized I have nothing to hide. My cats also seem to be fairly trustworthy despite their slight shadiness. I have really enjoyed learning all of the functions that this thing can do. I already bought some Philips Hue bulbs to use with it and they are equally amazing. Sound quality for streamed music is as good as you can get for this size.
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Excellent improvement,"We have several Amazon echo products, but this is the first 3rd Generation Echo Dot that we have added. What a difference! The speaker is a great improvement over the original models, it’s like night and day. Self-proclaimed audiophiles may dismiss the sound quality but we think it’s amazing for a small, self contained unit that acts as a facilitator for the Alexa network and as a speaker. Great buy."
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,A lot has changed since Gen 2!,"Bought this on sale to add to our collection of Amazon echo devices. In comparing this to a Gen 2, this is a step up. The overall size is a little larger, and its a bit heavier, but it feels solid. You can tell the design envelop was improved to provide a better sound, and overall experience of quality. Commands are the same, response is the same, but the sound quality is vastly improved. Nice job Amazon! Looking to buy more!"
1.0,a month ago,pcrichard.com,What a nightmare,Very disappointed with this echo dot. This purchase was made so that I could listen to music! Sadly I was unable to do so as Alexa requires that one purchase Alexa music App. First month trial then after a monthly fee... It picks up any moving noise and does not shut up. It invaded my privacy for several hours and the following morning I unplugged it and removed the app from my phone. So much for a wireless music pod..
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,this is our 5th,"This is our 5th purchase of this same item (giving this one to family) has all the features you could want from playing your radio stations (kat country) to blue tooth music from your device, or using hundreds (probably thousands) of 'skills' which can be enabled. Standard skills such as weather come already enabled, and many more are free to enable via the app. Would definitely recommend this to anyone. I haven't used the other versions of Echo Dot as this cheaper option does everything I could want it to."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Better sound, but...","I had an echo dot (2nd gen) before making this purchase, but after reading the reviews I decided to get another one for the bedroom. I read about the increased sound quality which made my decision to purchase another one easier. My 2nd gen is connected to a stereo and it needs it because it is in a much larger area. The 3rd gen is not connected and the sound functions just fine within the confines of my bedroom. However, when making calls with the 3rd gen as opposed to the 2nd gen, more than one person has said that the 2nd gen sounds much better. I have not been able to determine that it hears me better than the previous gen, but at $29.99 I have no complaints."

Your lack of any sort of customer service repels me, I certainly will not recommend Amazon to anyone, for anything. I would rather cut out my own spleen than do so, although I am sure that you will be soon selling a DIY kit for that as well, but without instructions."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,High quality practical device,"Solid build quality, attractive and impressive sound quality for its size. I love smart speakers and I’m disvovering more valuable features as time goes on. Bluetooth receiving and transmitting, Aux out provide versatility. I use Echos wired to better speakers but this 3rd gen Dot has decent sound that carries far without breaking up. Set up is fairly easy. I find Alexa to be “smarter” than Siri but expect some shortcomings no matter what smart speaker you chooose. I’ll stick w/ Alexa devices myself(other than iPhone)."
3.0,a month ago,bestbuy.ca,Helpful and annoying at times,"I bought this to be able to play music in other rooms, as a reminder system for the family, and entertainment source for the whole family. We placed this in the kitchen and play trivia hero nightly which is actually very fun, but every now and then the Alexa stops and shuts down, or doesn't hear what we say properly. Which is annoying at times. My grandsons who are 5, 4, and 3 love talking to her and asking her to play the wiggles or bedtime hero. All and all it is useful, but if I didn't have it I wouldn't miss it."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Amazon Alexa Junkie,"That's right! I'm an Amazon Alexa Junkie. At first I wasn't to hip on the idea of Amazon Alexa devices. But then my girlfriend gave me an Alexa. Turned out that I was pretty impressed at what it could do. That's when I went crazy & put one in every room in my house & one in my shop building. I've also started turning my house into a Smart Home with the purchase of Smart Plugs, Smart Switches and 4K UHD Fire Stick. This 3rd generation Dot is the one you want to get. Don't even think about buying the 2nd generation Dot. For 5 bucks more you can get the 3rd generation Dot with a bigger speaker that will blow the 2nd generation Dot out of the water. PEACE!"

5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Like It Better Than I Thought I would,"I mostly got this out of curiosity just to see what it does. The setup was pretty easy. To be honest, I'm surprised at how well it understands language and the number of things it can do. I have a child with a disability and he uses it to check the weather, listen to radio stations, and check my calendar. This is amazing technology. It's still a little freaky knowing that the device is always listening waiting for commands."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Love the speaker it’s loud enough for me,Better than buying a speaker. I like that I can tell alexa to set my alarm and ask weather and time or for her to play music without having to use my phone and I can carry on doing other things. Only annoying thing with alexa is she sometimes doesn’t understand what you saying and will play the wrong song lol. But not a big issue. You need wifi for alexa to actually work but if you can still use her via Bluetooth to play music
4.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Better speaker lousier Alexa.,The speaker is louder and better sounding but at the cost of Alexa not hearing you. I find myself constantly having to shout 3 or 4 times for Alexa to hear me. Just yesterday the tweeter blew out! Quality has gone down unfortunately because this is an excellent machine otherwise. Previous generation was excellent at being an assistant but lousy for music. The roles have reversed for this generation.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,ALEXA IS AMAZING,"I've been seeing commercials for different variations of this device for ages, but never was inspired to get one even though I'm into tech. After hearing real owners talk about them, plus the price drops on Black Friday, I took the plunge. With the incredible discounts, how could anyone not buy one? The Echo Dot (3rd Gen) is amazing. It answers fact based questions, plays music you request, and can even tell you the live score of a sporting event. It can also activate/adjust SMART connected devices. It was very easy to set up and use and I know many senior citizens that have them. I ended up buying a total of 5 of them."
5.0,10 months ago,Argos,Small device with high quality sound,"Very useful to have it. Come home from work and say Alexa play some country music. Let Alexa do the rest. Any question you can think of, Alexa will try to answer. Alexa read me the morning news. There she goes with the daily news. Kids love it. You can play hide and seek. Freeze musical game and lots more."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,These are addictive...,"Echo devices are addictive! We got the first one and set it up in our living room. For the price, this thing is brilliant! We have several Dots and a couple Echo Plus units now. Apart from the normal Alexa stuff, we use them for multi-room music and as an intercom system around the house. My son has a blast asking Alexa to make farting noises and to tell him jokes. These are so affordable that you can have a lot of fun with them! The mic pickup is pretty astounding and the speaker really isn't half bad. I like that I can set them up in stereo or connect them to bluetooth speakers as well."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,I would recommend to any one with pets.,"I was really hesitant for a long time on getting one, I’m a google person but after getting one I feel like my life has been simplified almost ! Plus my wife and I made a bunch of hilarious talk backs ! Spent like 3 hrs just playing with it the first night ! And whenever I leave my house I feel support secure with the alarmed setting plus it plays sounds for my dog when I leave ! Honestly such a great investment."
5.0,3 weeks ago,Best Buy,Great and fun little device,This was my second Echo Dot as I had gotten one on special from Amazon. Love having it my bedroom to listen to music/sounds at night and control my smartbulb. Very nice on these cold Wisconsin nights to be snuggled up and voice control my lamp. Lots of other skills and features to use too. Set up was a breeze. Plug in and open the Alexa app to find new device. That's it.

When I'm tied up in the kitchen, I ask Alexa to play music and when I'm preparing for work in the mornings, I ask her for the daily weather forecast. Also, despite the size, it has a mighty speaker inside with surprising sound quality.

4.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,"Audio that's powerful, but much too bassy","Added this to my collection of smart speakers - found it to have much more robust audio vs the previous generation of Dots, but it's much more bassy - or perhaps a better word would be muffled. Have played with the EQ settings, but haven't gotten this to sound as rich as I'd like. I find myself using the previous version of my Dot speaker much more often. Would love to find some advice that would make this sound more full-bodied."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,The perfect addition to my home,"The echo dot is a compact and small device that sits in any room looking uninteresting. That is until you wake it up, then it becomes a very useful, helpful device. I have mine linked to my todo app, so I can add reminders, shopping items etc., I can control my home heating, get notified when motion is detected on my door bell, etc. etc. I never thought I would want one, got one for free with the heating thermostat I bought, and this one I got from Argos makes my third."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,I love alexa,"I loved alexa! I already had 3 speakers and since I have a fairly big house and wanted one basically in every room I got 7 more. I never have connection issues or anything. She connects to my tv's, my phone, my ring doorbell, tells me when I have packages. Soooo many amazing features you can really program these dot's to do some neat stuff. I recommend this to everyone!"
5.0,6 months ago,Argos,Knowledge at your fingertips,"Really great product, its small and neat. Sound is really good and Alexas voice is clear. Ask anything....literally... and play games, set alarms. Turn on compatible lights and switches just by using your voice, im sure there are tonnes of other things it can do and im having fun finding out. So pleased with the system that im planning on giving as a gift to my elderly parents at Christmas..."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Easy to get started,"I originally bought 2 dots for my new house just to see what they were all about. I had them for roughly a week and decided to get 2 more to put in other rooms. Out of the box they are very simple to get set up and started and the app is easy to navigate. I have all of them linked so I can listen to music throughout the house, I have connected some to speakers because the sound quality for music isn’t great, but it isn’t advertised to be. I’ve bought some of the plugs since and plan on getting lights soon as well. If you want something to control your music, set up a morning routine (tell you weather, news, drive time to work, and play a custom playlist you choose), control lights, tv (if you have a smart tv), and just ask random questions, for sure get one!"
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Good speaker but less accurate audible commands.,"The speaker is great on this compared the the 2nd gen echo dot. Its much louder when playing music, However, I feel the 3rd gen does not pick up my voice as much compared to the 2nd gen. I have to speak louder and/or sometimes repeat myself. I personally feel the 2nd gen picks up my voice better in loud in areas of background noise. For instance I placed the 3rd gen and 2nd gen side-by-side in the same location in my kitchen nook area which is between my living room and kitchen. However, the 2nd gen picks up my audible commands 30% more than the 3rd gen. If you don't want a loud speaker any more for audible commands, then pick up the 2nd gen and save money."
2.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Good, Cheap speaker","The echo dots are very affordable and give you access to a lot of services and features in the amazon ecosystem as well as other ecosystems (Apple Music, smart plugs). I also like the fact that the echo dots have an external AUX port so you can easily plug these into better quality speakers. I returned this because I recently took a look at the privacy aspect of putting a monitoring device in my home. I opted to buy an Apple HomePod because of the way they handle data requests."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,love it!,Alexa is my new best friend. So easy to use and really helps for setting time alarms when cooking and baking. Speaker is very good and I often play music through it. Just purchased a second one for the basement so I can call the family to dinner instead of shouting down the steps. Highly recommend. In the last 4 months needed to reboot it one time as it stopped talking to me but that was minor.
5.0,2 months ago,ebay.com,Questionable!,"Love echo dot but has an issue with Amazon when setting up that it wast purchased from them. The was clarified by Amazon when I read them the code on the bottom of the sealed box. I was advised to contact original purchaser to get some kind of number! I told them it was a gift and they helped walk me through set up advising me that set up might not work. Well,set up went well and we love the product!! Scare tactics through Amazon wouldnt stop me from purchasing another from this seller. Thank you"
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,MAKES MY LIFE SO MUCH EASIER,"Alexa can answer many Questions for me quickly and accurately. Weather reports, AMAZON Deliveries, fact checking, can turn on and off lights, stream music from many sources and so much more! What it does not know it can learn on the program that teaches it about your interests. Wonderful add on to making my retirement so much easier. One of the best features is the audio, no more typing and searching just ask Alexa!"
5.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Much Better than I Expected,"I am still figuring out how practical this Alexa Dot is, but it certainly is a lot of fun, especially the smart speaker. I put this one in my office and will buy another soon as an alarm clock. I am an Amazon Prime member, but never took advantage of the free Amazon music until I bought this product. Alexa has a sense of humor. I look forward to the day when more machine learning is built into the product."
5.0,a year ago,Currys,Neil's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 3rd Gen 2018 Charcoal,"Pros: The sound produced is much better than I was expecting. Generally it recognises our voices well and responds accurately. Looks good. Can control so much in our home from it including lights, heating, music. Was very easy to set up. Cons: Struggled to find wall mounts in the UK, but not really an issue of the product. No other problems found so far after a month of use."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,amazon dot sounds great,When I first opened the box I thought Tiny. But this is more than a speaker for listening to music. It opens a whole new world. All the things you can ask Alexa and get it to do. The size is just right for the living room and the sound quality is great. I liked it so much I have bought another one for the bedroom with the alarm clock showing. Enjoy using and owning this.
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Third echo dot!,"We already had 2 echo dots at home so bought this third one for our static caravan. Works really well. We tend to use it to receive radio stations, particularly those that don't broadcast on FM, but it is also great for asking questions about travel, news etc. ie, anything that you would look up on Google. Can use it for pop/film quizzes and suspect there's loads of functions we have yet to find. Very easy to set up and a great price."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Love how it looks!,I brought this for Christmas after wanting one for a while. The grey looks really stylish and matches my room really well! Only issue I have had is that while listening to music it will sometime loose connection and I will have to reboot it which is slightly annoying. Apart from that I love my Alexia! It's very helpful with reminders which is good for me as i am a forgetful person so it makes my life a little easier.
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Echo Dot perfect like a member of the family.,"Echo Dot is wonderful. Sits quietly while waiting to her name. The response with answers to questions. Fab at music. As easy to follow instructions is simple to install. Soon up & running. Recommend for vision impaired, movement restricted people of most ages. Highly recommend echo dot. As been the best Christmas gift."
4.0,a month ago,Currys,Steven's review of Amazon Echo Dot 3rd Generation with Clock - Sandstone,Pros: Great for setting quick alarms and listening to internet radio. Cons: I still have reservations about products such as these. Call me a conspiracy theorist but I still view them as home based clandestine information gathering machines - just like smart meters. My advice: be very careful what you ask Alexa and erase all questions asked on a daily basis.
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Much better than 2nd Generation Echo Dot,"I replaced the 2nd Gen with this 3rd Gen Echo Dot. The previous one had horrible sound. Too tinny. This new one is much louder. Easier to hear it when Alexa is speaking. The music sound has improved tremendously, however I still recommend the bigger Echo for sound quality. But for the size, the Dot does quite well."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Best gen yet,This was an upgrade from the original echo dot for me. I wasn’t expecting it to sound that much better than the original. I use this model in my bathroom and it fills the room with music Or my flash briefing while showering and I hear it clearly. The clock also helps me stay on time and has an auto dimming feature which gets darker when your turn the lights off and brighter when they are on so it would me a great addition for a bedroom.
5.0,3 months ago,Argos,Fantastic purchase,"I bought one of these for the person I care for who suffers from bipolar disorder. It's been a great purchase, it helps to remind him of simple daily things such as feeding the cats, taking medication, and the shopping list feature is very useful too. Instead of asking me for things all the time, he can instead ask Alexa which is great especially for when I am not around. Technology such as this would be brilliant for anyone who suffers from disability such as blindness."
3.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Better Echo options are available,"I ordered this Dot for it's clock feature but later also ordered the View 5 which was a better option in the end. Since the Dot is small, the clock is small. In my opinion, the View 5 with its nice sized screen is simply more functional and versatile than the Dot. Also, when the View 5 can be purchased under the 2 for 1 pricing, it's a much better value than the Dot since it costs only about $10.00 more let unit (but you must buy 2)."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,My echo dot is a fab addition to the house,"I love the echo dot. It’s so easy to use, has a stylish design and we had no difficulty in setting it up. My wife loves using it to listen to different radio stations and has it hooked up to her phone for shopping lists. Also really helpful for setting reminders to take out the bins etc. Would definitely recommend and we have actually bought another one as a present for my mum and as dad."
5.0,2 weeks ago,Best Buy,Efficient & smart & learns new things everyday,"This echo is great! It’s small but loud and I use it all the time! I have one in the kitchen, living room, bedroom and I will be placing the other in my bathroom. Great smart system: alarm, setting reminders, timers, asking for the weather, eta, and so to amazon or Apple Music. You can even play games with her. Best investment."
4.0,4 weeks ago,Best Buy,Nice little upgrade for Amazon assistant.,"Like most people I have these all over my house. The newest 3rd generation update improves the speakers both with hardware and by their placement. It does make it a bit more difficult to wall or ceiling mount them though so if that's what you need to do, consider opting for the 1st or 2nd generation versions where the speaker was not on the sides. But if you are just placing it on a desk or table, this one is ideal."
4.0,a month ago,Argos,Alexa Dot with a great design,Easy to set up and great design. New alexa dot is sturdy and looks fabulous. The voice recognition range is quite poor and if you are more than 3 meters away from the dot and if the TV is on she can hardly hear you. The sound is decent however the bass is quite low. I will recommend it for beginners however the echo show is better if you want more quality sound!
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,I want to get another one.,"I have Echos throughout my home (4 in total), including this Echo Dot with clock in my bathroom. I love that this Echo Dot has a clock, it definitely helps to keep track of time when I'm running in the mornings to get ready for work. I can hear the news while I shower (it's not waterproof, I listen to it from across the bathroom), I can set timers, listen to music, and ask Alexa anything, including weather. Not only is this great in a bathroom but anywhere in a home really. I want to get another one."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Great!,"Got this when I was looking for a DAB radio alarm clock, this was what came up when I put it into search. It’s so good the alarm works brilliant and I can get any radio station I want, all I have to do is ask for it. The sound quality is really good. Plus having amazon prime it’s even better because you can listen to any individual songs you want with prime music. Would definitely recommend if you are looking for a radio alarm like I was."
5.0,10 months ago,Argos,Echo Dot 3 is brilliant.,"We have two of these, both on offer so good value. No more shouting family members to the dinner table. Very easy to use and useful in so many ways. So far we’ve found recipes, checked travel, had bedtime stories, used for homework tests and listened to the radio with good sound quality. Looking to buy another for my parents so they can send and receive texts and calls without the small text of a smartphone. Would highly recommend."
4.0,a year ago,Currys,Gemma's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 3rd Gen 2018 Charcoal,"Pros: Looks good, easy enough to set up, reasonably priced Cons: To really get any benefit from it you have to be signed up with premium subscriptions to things like Spotify and other apps etc. Also takes a while to get set up with linking your contacts and other stuff. That being said, once you have finished it's pretty good. I brought it because my daughter asked for one for Christmas but I hadn't realised you have to buy a load of extra products like the plug sockets and light bulbs if you really want to use it to it's full potential. To ask alexa to turn on household appliances etc you already need have to have a load of that stuff, or if you're planning to upgrade things in your home it's a great product."
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,I love it! It gives me a whole new outlook on tec,"It started as me buying myself a gift of the Fire Stick with my income tax refund. However, the sales associate recommended the Echo Dot third generation as well. I figured, why not? This is by far the best electronic purchase I’ve made in the past 20 years! Amazon outdid themselves with this one, and I’m just happy Best Buy sells these products! Thank you Best Buy!"
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Great speaker and A.I. Technology,This Amazon Echo Dot third-generation was a great buy. The speaker is definitely an upgrade from the second generation and can go much lower and have slightly better bass tones. Amazon‘s Alexa is much better than the Apple series. She can process more commands and do many more things than Siri can. I would not waste time purchasing a different A.I.
5.0,6 months ago,Argos,Echo Dot,"Ive always been reluctant to purchase and use such a device with reports of Alexa listening in etc but decided to judge for myself. Once i figured out the initial setup, which for a technofobe, was about an hour its easy enough to use. Having fun picking the most obscure tracks i can think of to test it and as a whole its delivered. We even had a sing a long to tracks of our early childhood songs. Good quality sound for such a small unit and a neat appearance"
5.0,a month ago,Argos,My amazon echo dot ... a revalation,I was sceptical. I am not any more. Sitting watching TV with my parents dad asked how old is Tom Jones ? I repeated his question inserting ALEXA as the first word and .. well he is 79. Great for playing the radio (including LBC !) and a fantastic google like facility with those who dont like typing or who were a little old for the computer age. Also really popular with kids !!
3.0,a month ago,Currys,Melanie's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 3rd gen (2018) Sandstone,Pros: It’s nice having a range of music at your finger tips Cons: It’s very hard to get it tounderstand what you want it to play and sometimes is so frustrating we give up bothering. I also don’t like the fact that the device ‘listens’ to your conversation when supposedly it is not on - the only way to stop this is to unplug it between uses and then it’s can take time to reconnect. We took my daughter’s one back because she felt so uncomfortable she would t use it.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Even Better Than Expected!,"I recently purchased the Amazon Echo Show and 2 Echo Dots and wasn't keen at how a ring of light is constant and there isn't any way to disable it (that I could find anyway - and darkness is crucial for my sleep). I had to purchase 2 more and I'll be honest, I wasn't looking forward to their parking it in my home with their nighttime light shows. Turns out, the 3rd gen has the option to disable this wretched feature. I am now a converted fan and Alexa has her original name back instead of expletives preceding it!"
5.0,9 months ago,Argos,"Classy, modern design, easy and fun to use","A really classy, modern looking gadget. Easy to set up, though it takes some time to set up initially with your preferences. The only negative is in order to fully make a good use of it and listen to whatever music you want , you need to pay and register with Spotify or Amazon. I have noticed that it does a lot of the things that Google Assistant would do for me. Good use for a radio, quick weather forecast check, news, reminders, etc."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Really easy to use,Eco dot is amazing. Literally ready to use within 5 mins of getting it out of the box. Bought it for my girlfriend for Xmas and she loves it. Easy connection pairs with all of the music apps as soon as you pair your phone. I bought this with click and reserve. Really easy to do and amazing customer service. I reserved it looked into it and bought it within an hour. Including travel time. No time wasting. Awesome!
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Very happy with purchase,The echo dot (3rd Gen) is ideal for placing in any additional room or distance area in the home expanding the reach of your smart home at an economical price point. It’s sound is acceptable of its size just as long as the sound level is set at or below midpoint. My echo dot was included at no cost with the purchase of an Echo Show 8 which was also discounted so I am very happy with my purchase. Fulfilling all my expectations without any additional cost to me demands an evaluation of 5 stars.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Love this for my Smart Home,"I control my lights, outlets and TV with this device. I have another one in the house too. I need to get two more so I can control everything else from anywhere in the house. Oh, and I have a Bose SoundTouch Portable on WIFI Connection. Alexa controls it too. Super cool to live a life like Star Trek in the year 2019. I plan to buy more Alexa controlled devices in the future too."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Works as Advertised, can turn off mike","I'm a bit concerned about having an internet device constantly listening in my house. I was not going to get one of these devices for that reason, but when I got the Ring video doorbell it was a bundle. I use it to annunciate when someone is at the door but I'm finding I use it more and more. For instance, I was going to install a thermometer outside, now I just ask Alexa. The best part is there is four buttons on top, one of which mutes the microphone so it allegedly doesn't listen unless I push the button. The other thing I like is it will respond to ""computer"" vice ""Alexa"" which reminded me of the original Star Trek. That was cute for a while, but I have switched it back to ""Alexa."""
2.0,11 months ago,very.co.uk,Broke on first day,"Does what an alexa should do, however on the first day of use the speakers got extreamly distorted. When she speaks or plays music the sound is so crackly and horrific, I have had to turn her off as I can't bare it. I need to now buy speakers to use or I can't use the product. Also all electronics that I have bought from very last around 4 days. Pc, ps4, laptop, alexa. Will not buy an electrical from very again."
2.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Just a tool for them to make more sales,I can't complain too much because I got it for free with a purchase of Blink security cameras. I would like the echo dot to be able to play the sound of youtube videos. Why? because youtube is free. I'm not going to join amazon music when the web is has loads of places to play free music. I had a hard time getting it setup with my wifi because it only receives 2400ghz and my network is both 5ghz. So I had to create separate SSID's to get it to connect. Right now I use it for iheart radio which is ok and occasionally an alarm. I wouldn't buy one but I'm well aware of Corporations putting out stuff that require more money to do anything.
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Love this echo dot.,I love this thing. It is very fun and easy to use and set up. It does have the option to contro your lights with your voice if you don’t have a bridge. You have to find the certain ones they aren’t that expensive in my opinion. I have the TP link ones and they are bright and change colors well with voice. This thing is loud when the volume is up. And it’s not like the echo 2nd gen in terms of bass but there’s enough.
5.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Great nightstand clock,"I bought this to replace my nightstand clock. This is great. I have it set to wake me in the weekdays only at a certain time. The numbers are very readable in bright or low light. Package that with all the functionality of Alexa and it’s a great combination. Could be a few bucks cheaper, but I was in the market for a new clock and wanted to give it a go. Nice job Amazon!"

4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Never thought I would like but I do!!,"Thought just pressing a few buttons on my remote was the best way to control my electronics but hate to admit it but I was ""mostly"" wrong. She is gradually winning me over but darn having another woman to answer to sometimes is a little strange but I got to say it's more good than bad. She seems to understand my commands better every day and she has stopped giving me a hard time about the way I pronounce some of my words. Good range and for such a small foot print she is big were it counts.Yep she's winning me over faster every day."
5.0,11 months ago,Office Depot,Handy Intercom!,"Used this with our full sized Echo to create a simple, effective and inexpensive intercome between my office on the first floor of our home and my husbands on the 2nd, using the Alexa ""DropIn"" feature. No more shouting up the stairs! The Dot has great sound for music, too, and comes in handy for reminders, information, timers, etc. If you price in-home intercoms these days you will see that this is a very reasonable alternative and it does a lot more than just handle voice communications."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great addition to a household.,"BestBuy's 2/$50 deal is definitely the way to go if you live in a house. It preforms exactly as advertised: Music, simple tasks, and info. The 3rd gen Dot's speaker is more than adequate for music listening. Sync and then place in different areas of the house and they can act as an intercom. Getting Alexa to work with different smart devices can be a little challenging because many of these devices require separate controllers or a `bridge' for the different technologies to interface. If you plan to fully unlock Alexa's potential and convert to a smart house, it can be quite expensive."
4.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Decent alexa for the price.,"Its a decent alexa for the price you pay, fabric is good quality, as these look more modern. From my experience i think the previous alexa generations have better mics compare to the new ones, as sometimes you find yourself repeating ""alexa"" twice or more only because it couldn't hear you. When it comes to the speakers for music, its actually pretty good, really loud. Do i recommend? well if you're trying to get an alexa, these ones are pretty decent."
2.0,3 weeks ago,influenster.com,"I use to love Alexa, until there were other options finally available. It seems as though other home assistance brands get more user friendly, Alexa stays behind on understanding commands or having to have an extensive command prompt to get what you want. The speaker is somewhat ok if you need a bathroom jam session but doesn't hold up well in large spaces. Personally I plan to look elsewhere for our home assistance needs.","I use to love Alexa, until there were other options finally available.

5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Christmas gift,"Mom wanted one for Christmas. She has poor vision and I was worried about her being able to read it but she has no problems. Her biggest problem, is more of a “character flaw”. She expects Alexa to know her 100% straight out the box. She (pretends) doesn’t understand Alexa Skills and I have to add them for her but the speakers sound amazing and can be heard pretty much all over her 3000sq ft home if desired."
3.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,a little bit improved,"I personally think it has way too much bass in its default setting and the voice sounds muffled. Be sure to go into your Alexa app where you can adjust the bass, treble and midrange. I don't like that they removed Alexa's ability to sound a tone showing the new volume you have selected using your voice, for example telling her ""Volume 8"" or ""Volume 3."" I do like the increased volume and seemingly better microphones."
5.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Great replacement,Ok so yes it can be a little hard of hearing but when it works it works. It is a definite upgrade over the gen 2 model in about every way possible. For home automation I think it works great but if you are one to ask for or need more information I would suggest a google home. I honestly have both setups and I use the echo dot a lot more. It is a great device especially if you have already vested into the amazon ecosystem.
4.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,"It's Alexa, but you might want a Gen 2!","It's an Echo Dot. It's Alexa. You talk, it listens. This one has better sound, but here is what it doesn't have: Micro USB power input. You give up flexible power source with this echo. No battery option, no reusing old phone chargers. This has a DC barrel that Amazon will happily sell you a replacement. Keep that in mind when choosing your dot."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,The sound is great,"I own both the gen 2 and now gen 3 echo dot. There is a big improvement in the sound quality in the gen 3. I have a Bluetooth speaker connected to gen 2 dot, so I bought a Bluetooth speaker to go along with the gen 3. After setting up the gen 3 with the Bluetooth speaker I immediately disconnected the Bluetooth speaker because the gen 3 echo dot was louder and clearer. I would recommend the gen 3 echo dot to anyone."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Even Better!,"Picked two of them up, already set one up last night after getting home. I like my gen 2. 4yr old daughter uses my gen 2 echo dot to control the fire stick in the living room. I use it often for timers, date and time. Due to sound quality I use fire stick and not echo dot gen 2. The reviews I have seen are correct! This new echo dot has great sound. Blows the old one away on quality and volume. Fewer mics isn't a problem, it does even better hearing us. Plus I'm going from 1 to 3, multi-room is nice feature. I don't like my older one now, this one makes that seem like junk. Works the same, but big hardware upgrade, even weighs more. Night and day between new and old gen 2 echo dot!!!"
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Echo’s are for life not just for Christmas,"Cannot recommend those item enough for the older generation. In general we get forgetful, blind and just down right special the older we get. Using this item will allow you to have a new best friend in the house without the annoyance of actually having a friend. Everything you want and more without the interaction of the outside world. A must have item. #simplylovleh"
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,it came free with the TV,"Look, it came free with the TV. I'm not a fan of these things, but with the way technology works, your cellphone already grabs information when you talk and filters your data. I gave it away to someone who would use it as opposed to stare at it suspiciously waiting for the AI uprising. She's quite pleased. If you want to ask Alexa to play Baby Shark, this is for you. If you've seen the entire Terminator series more than once, avoid it."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Our First Alexa Device is a Hit !,"Never had any of the old versions but read the sound wasn’t as good as this 3rd generation. I can testify this one is loud and clear ! I can be in my bedroom and speak to Alexa in the kitchen 1-2 rooms away and she can still hear me. You can ask her to raise her volume or lower it without going to the dot itself so that’s a plus. We have set up our lights with it and it works perfect, very easy. Alexa responds to anyone’s voice so that could be a plus or minus if others start commanding her to do things. The great thing is both my husband and can add Alexa to the app on our separate phones ( one iPhone and one Android ) and we both have access to make changes so that’s a bonus."
3.0,a month ago,Argos,I really like the product but it keeps breaking,"Excellent product but only really if you have the other Amazon subscriptions i.e. Amazon music. Mine keeps cutting out while using it and freezing, contacted Amazon who told me to reset it to a Factory settings which isn't ideal but I did. Worked fine for about 30min after doing this then just froze/cut off again. Not very happy. Excellent idea and would love it if it'd stop breaking"
5.0,a year ago,Target,If you are on the edge read this,"If your thinking about buying this I highly recommend! It’s amazing and whenever I play music my whole family flocks to it and we all dance and sing. Plus if you don’t like it targets costumer service is literally the best they are amazing!! The sound is always crisp and clear and the music is amazing I had friends asking me what speaker it was (I posted a video of the bass without showing the actual echo) and I said “my echo dot” they sounded surprised, becuase this one compared to the old one is ledgendary. There is also this thing called “find my phone” and I use that all the time too. This review probably sounds super fake but I promise I’m real, not a bot. Of course I’m not an expert but I suggest this item!"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Good purchase,This is the 1st dot that I have owned so I can't compare it to the previous versions. The Dot ver 3 has a really good speaker. It can get pretty loud for such a small unit and it's very easy to connect it to a Bluetooth speaker if you want something louder or better quality for streaming music. It easily connects to your home wifi (no computer needed) via the Alexa app on your phone. Setup took about 2 minutes. Now I am able to control my Hue lights with my voice set a timer or just ask random questions. The initial offer price at 2 for $50 is a steal. I picked up 4 and am very happy with the results.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Nice device,We bought this to be used as an alarm clock in my sons room. The clock on the device is great. This generation of Echo Dot seems to be an improvement over the last. Sound is much improved as his voice recognition. Alexa seems to work so much better than Siri. We are trying to work on implementing a “smart home.“ The Amazon echo devices really seem to work well together.
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Small smart speaker with a lot of bang for your $,"I started with one and now my home is fully automated with 5 echo dots and one echo plus controlling everything from lights, to Xmas tree, coffee machine, irrigation system, heat/ac , doors, spa, garage etc. Small compact design fits easily on any shelf. Love whole home music playing across all of them. Sound quality is great. Thank you Alexa!"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Superb!,"This is the 2nd generation of this product that I have owned. I picked it up because you could make phone calls to virtually anyone, and the earlier version could not do this. What pleased me greatly was the quality of sound. No one really even knows that I am on the rough equivalent of a speakerphone when I make calls. Usually, for example, my mother complains that she cannot hear me. She is 94 and has a hearing problem, but she has yet to even figure out that I am calling from a different resource. And she has not complained about not hearing me at all. In fact, the quality of sound is so good that I play music through it and I am amazed at how good it sounds."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,The Next Gen,"I already had a 2nd Gen Dot, which I purchased 2 years ago. I really wanted a Ring doorbell, and saw that the 3rd Gen Dot was free with the purchase of a Ring. I snagged that deal! I put the 3rd Gen in my bedroom and wasn't expecting much. I was WRONG! The sound quality is, hands down, 110% better than the 2nd Gen Dot. Plus, it is much more responsive. I have it on my headboard, and use it for Sleep and relaxation sounds. It's wonderful because I don't have to listen to my husband snore anymore. lol I also like the fact that it doesn't interfere with the other Dot that is in my kitchen. Plus, when I play my Amazon Prime music on it, and connect it via Bluetooth to my Samsung Stereo bar, it doesn't drop out, or lose connection like the 2nd Gen did. I will be using it much more now.Less"
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,I'm using these as gifts not for myself.,Two (2) of these actually came with the hundreds of dollars in security equipment that I purchased it was part of the special that was going on at my Best Buy store. I never had any plans of using these for myself I don't care to be so connected with prying eyes or ears in my residence. I gave one to my cable company Tech because he's so great and I'll be giving the other one away to someone else who is deserving as well. They do cost $50 each however they were marked down to $30 and again two (2) of them came with my extensive Security package. Because I bought all of the other devices I needed for my hardwired ring front doorbell and my ring camera and solar panel for the back. Good luck if you like these things!
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,How you place it makes difference,"Google home has a top facing Sound vent, while this has sidewards. I actually use this as a speaker most of the time to play songs. I used to mount Google Home on a wall next to the socket and it gives good sound, while Echo spreads sound along the plane of the wall. So this has to be placed on a horizontal surface for max sound output. Apart from that, it works good."
5.0,6 months ago,Kohl's,BOMB DOT COM!,"We now have 6 of the echo dots around our home and probably more to come! My hubby and 4 children all love the echo, especially our 4 yr old! His language can be a little hard to understand yet Alexa ALWAYS knows what he’s saying! #winning Unlike Siri who rarely gets what even I’m saying. The games are fun and who doesn’t love endless music at their disposal! Oh and the sound on these are SO GOOD!"
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Easy!,"Easy is the word for this review. Best Buy pickup was easy, in spite of the Mrs. being marked as the ""pickup"" person for the purchase; BB was able to fix that and we were off! The install as usual was easy too! This was Amazon Echo 4 & 5 for our home and we're really enjoying them all over the house. A little dodgy internet access in the kitchen for some reason that seems to be requiring a daily reboot of that unit but all-in-all a great way to listen to NPR, podcasts, the weather & a quick traffic update for the morning commute!"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Works great,"I waited a long time to get one of these because I wasn't sure how much I would use it. Well, I use it every day. Alexa plays music for me, tells me the outside temperature, sets multiple cooking timers. Works as a bluetooth speaker for my computer. I am sure there are hundreds of other features. I don't even have any of the smart appliances to go with it, but I still love it!"
3.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Echo Dot is a mediocre product.,"Setup of the Echo Dot is extremely cumbersome. It took several attempts before I was able to make it to work. A week later it lost WIFI connection, for whatever reason. I had to spend two hours to restore the connection. For sure, the instructions are terrible. Answering simple questions by the ECHO DOT is OK, But not with slightly more complicated questions. Not impressive."
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Bought this to go with the Large Echo,"I bought this for my daughter who is handicapped, legally blind and can't use a phone. She has been getting training with it and she loves it. She can tell Alexia to call for help if there were an emergency (it sync's to my phone), turn on the lights and ask her to play music :) She can ask her to tell jokes, set an alarm or what the weather is going to be. It's unlimited and a great tool for her! This one goes in my room so we can drop in on each other in case she needs me or I need to check on her."
4.0,a month ago,Argos,Smart looking device,"This is a great little device, very well designed has a right good sound for the size of it, music sounds nice, all in all a great little device that will do more than what you expect from it. Only down side with it that I find annoying is you have to keep the device plugged in but you can buy add ons like a battery base, but about £25. But I bought a wall mount, it's a mount you attach the echo dot to plug it into a socket, no visible wire & only £8 I got it for. RECOMEND ECHO DOT"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Makes a great gift for anyone.,"My father is physically disabled on one side of his lower body and a product like this makes his daily living much easier with just a voice command that enables him to live more comfortably, learn conveniently, and listen to his hearts content. With system connectivity and control, access to valuable information through web such as traffic/weather/encyclopedia/online stores, etc., music, and even simple things like hearing a good joke...His smile was the brightest this past Christmas. You do need an Amazon account, the Echo device app on your phone, and connection/link took quite some time and process. If it was more simple and made more user friendly for non-tech savvy people like my mother, it'd be 5 stars. Overall, there's nothing negative I have to say about it."
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Echo Dot,"I have several of this smaller version speaker. They work very well. I have one I have set up for outdoors but leave indoors due to weather and just take out when I plan to use it. I also have several of the larger, taller version which I thick sound a little better but they are both great products. I enjoy the fact that you can have them all going at the same time and when you go from room to room there is music everywhere!!!"
5.0,9 months ago,Argos,Echo Dot well worth the cost,"I got this through fast track and was in and out of the store in 2 minutes. Took about 5mins to set up and link to my music account. Sound is great using built in speakers and was very easy linking to my Bluetooth speakers. Me and my family use it daily and have fun finding out everything Alexa can do. I like it so much I am now going to get one for just about every room as well as looking for smart devices to connect to it i.e. light switches etc. Don't just think about it, buy one."
4.0,6 months ago,very.co.uk,Love it,For a small size it gives off a great volume range. Really loud on volume 10. This is what I was worried about most. Signed up to the amazon music and it has so far played all the songs requested. I don’t think it would be as good if you didn’t sign up to the amazon music though. You can use other channels like Spotify. Easy to set up and I use it every day. Picked up my WiFi in the worse signal area at the back of my house so really good.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,"Awesome device. Tried out one, bought 3 after","We tried one out and it worked great! With a newborn, and often having no hands, it is very helpful to turn on or off lights, and play lullabies to help soothe him to sleep. We bought one to try it out, and loved it so much we bought 3 more. We also have a deaf son, who has speech problems. He can't say Google, or Alexa but he can say Echo and is exhilarated when Echo understands him (he is 9)."
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Love it,"Had a first gen Echo since they came out. Mistakenly bought a google home mini when the dots were all sold out. The mini is horrible. Bought a dot when they came back in stock and couldn't be happier. Amazon leads the pack. This thing always hears me, has tons of answers for everything, controls tons of devices (lights, tv, thermostat to name a few) and is easily the best smart device in this category."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Stylish design with new LED clock display,"- Echo Dot with Clock is an ideal companion for a nightstand or kitchen counter. - Clock functions are smart - display the time, temperature or any timers you may have set visually - Great sound quality for its size - This Echo Dot has all of the same features and functionality as other Echo devices but comes with clock display. - Physical mics off button - Currently only comes in one colour it would be great if there was range of colours to choose from."
5.0,10 months ago,Target,BIG VALUE IN A SMALL PACKAGE AND PRICE!!!,"This is a super value at the price it’s selling for,I got it so I could turn on and off my Xbox One X with Alexa,which it does ,but I didn’t know that Alexa can play almost any song,answer questions like Google and she also plays ambient sounds(ocean waves, rain,etc.) and tells stories besides being your alarm clock. I am honestly super impressed with the number of features Alexa has. Excellent product and virtually flawless. I FORGOT TO MENTION HOW GREAT THE SOUND QUALITY IS,IMPRESSIVE!!!"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Easy as pie,These cameras are easy to install and use. There are adjustments to be made so use your head and make them for each camera you have. Blink also lets you know that adjustments may be needed due to too many activations. You do not need to but it does save on batteries. The clarity is great even in the rain. You will find yourself playing with them to be sure they are working. We have had interruptions with wireless connectivity but still not sure if it’s Blink or cable. Very good price point to give you piece of mind and NO monthly fee!
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Easy to use; great introduction unit to Alexa,"The profile is very nice and the speaker is clearer, compared to the 2nd gen Echo Dot unit I had previously. Interface to program/set preferences is done through either the phone or through the interface that can be accessed via computer. A good way to try out Amazon Echo Dot if you're looking to convert your home into a smart home! I also like that I got this with my watch purchase, so free is always better."
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Love Echo Dot,"It's good to have Amazon prime membership before you purchase this product. We mainly use it to listen to music (from amazon music). It's very easy, quick and convenient to play music. It also can be used as alarm set up, weather check or time check. Due to the size of the product, sound quality is not very good so we connect to speaker to change sound output. We got it for 20 dollars at Best buy so it's a good deal for us."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Essential for smart home.,"I have four of these to keep in voice contact with Alexa throughout the house. This is important if you have smart home features in multiple areas of the house. I find the audio to be acceptable for music but voice for news reports can be difficult to understand. The sound equalizer controls are not adequate to adjust for spoken words. (Probably a limitation of the speakers). When you do adjust the sound using the equalizer within the app it will tell you adjustments cannot be made unless audio is playing. It means ""music."" Spoken words, such as newscasts, don'the count."
5.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Alexa Is Everywhere,"If you don't have one of these go get one! I had no idea that Alexa could do so many things! I'm gonna take her with me to pick winning lotto numbers and a trip to Vegas too. I'm predicting that within the next couple of years, she will be able to do your laundry, wash your car and cook dinner too! Now if they can find a decent mascot or ""AI"" body to put her in, she could be like TED with full body movement capabilities. Until then we just wait in anticipation."
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Like this better than Google Home,"I'm new to the ""smart speaker"" game. I only bought this because it was on sale, so it was a ""why not"". I also bought a ""home mini"". I wanted to try both and see which I like better. I definitely like Echo/Alexa better. Alexa works with more of the things I already have (XBOX, Wyze Cams) and the simple things I do, like set reminders and play relaxation sounds at night, just work better. I don't do a ton with this yet, but I will."
5.0,a year ago,Target,Worth buying on sale for me,"I purchased the Echo Dot to replace an old radio I use in my kitchen, the sound on the radio was problematic. Also, changing radio stations required scrolling with a dial. Getting this on sale meant that it was definitely worth it for me. It performs as expected. In fact, I'm impressed at how well it understands my voice. I don't have any ""smart"" things in my house (lights, thermostat, appliance) so I can't say anything about those functions. The sound quality is fine for me, but I'm not too discerning and it's better than the old radio."
5.0,3 weeks ago,Best Buy,Nice gadget,I was not sure about having this type of device but have found it useful and fun at times. If you are worried about it just unplug it when you are not using it. The Phone app is well Organized and easy to change settings . You do need it to get it online for set up. After that just ask it answers. It does have an option to turn off listening so it will not respond to anything . For a small speaker the music sound quality is very good
5.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Great add-on for my Echo Plus,"As my smart home gets getting bigger, I needed a second Alexa device for upstairs to control my smart plugins in my bedroom. This small and convenient echo dot does exactly what I needed, elegant design and very responsive, goes well with my bedroom decor and does the job just fine. I can now turn on the kitchen lights from my bedroom with a voice command before I even get out of bed."
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,I bought the Amazon Echo Plus 2nd Gen to start.,"I fell in LOVE with it and started finding great deals on the Echo Dots so I could afford to scatter them throughout the house. Once you really dig into all of the things Alexa is capable of you won’t stop trying new stuff. The dots are awesome Add-ons to the Main Echo Plus 2nd Gen, just really neat gadgets to have. I guess one would be alright to have as a solo but if you can spring for the Echo Plus with the built in hub , I would definitely suggest it."
3.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Not much free music choice and entertainment,"Works well. Without issues so far but set up instruction not quite accurate, I had to call support. Tested translation - not really convenient and advanced. They may need to improve that. Also, as I put on review summary not much choice for free music. Alexa does not well understand music genres - e.g. for classic music she plays rock music (well, classic rock)"
4.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Not used a lot in my house.,"Besides the occasional alexa what’s the weather forecast today? Alexa is really not used too much in our house. I would recommend it if you have a numerous “smart appliances”. The microphone has about a 30ft range and can be heard from that distance, speaking in a normal volume. The sound is adequate for a room speaker for some background music. All in all she’s there, she’s listening,"
5.0,2 months ago,ebay.com,"Perfect little gadget, very clever.","Brilliant little gadget, great for sitting round the dinner table after eating and taking it in turns to ask Alexa to play a favourite song from the past. Gets you singing along and so much better than watching TV and not communicating. Also great for waking you up to music in the morning, just tell Alexa what you want to hear and what time to wake you. Best little gadget I've bought in ages!"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Sound!,"The bass and treble can be adjusted in the app (which is nice for apartment living). I had upgraded my bathroom from gen 2 dot to the gen 3 and it was a big improvement. Shortly after this purchase, I made the jump to a different home assitant, because I noticed that soon after playing YouTube videos had been limited, it seems that Alexa herself had taken a step back and just stayed there. The Alexa services and the app's progress seems to have come to a complete halt and there are many quirks here and there regarding understanding, hearing, learning, usability and functioning in general. To each their own, this product (even as just a full sounding speaker) is worth the money and upgrade from the Gen 2 Dot."
4.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Great for the price,"I received this free with purchase of Nest Theromstat. I was excited to use it and to link this up to several other gadgets in my home. I became aware that it is ""Hit and Miss"" to get the correct responding action that is requested, such as playing a certain song by and artist. Sometimes the Echo can locate that song and sometimes it cannot. The family does love the corny jokes it tells though."
4.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Beautiful Little Speaker,"Always a huge fan of Google Home speakers and wanted to give this a try with all the hype around it. True to its fame, echo dot has impressed at more levels. The little bass is more than enough for such a tiny gadget, but the vocals were pretty weak. Except this flaw, everything about the speaker like alexa, integration with smart lights, music accounts, etc were a breeze"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,I have over 20 of these,"Big fan. Just get one and you'll be intrigued. Get a few and group them and it's better. Add devices you can control (plugs, light bulbs (including brightness and color), security camera, sprinklers, garage door, fans, etc.) and you'll be hooked. Add IFTT controls (mine turns my lights blue when BYU wins their game), setup routines (I say ""Alexa Emergency"" and every light turns on, the show turns to full volume, then it issues a warning (intruder alert, the security footage has been sent to the cloud, the cops have been called. Intruder alert--then it plays LOUT sirens). Now you are cool."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,So good I bought more,"Love it! I bought this for my daughter who’s 11, she loves it! I bought her a compatible light bulb too. It didn’t take long to set up and was quite easy, it was a little trickier to connect the light bulb to it but still fairly easy(I watched a YouTube video) I loved the product so much, I went and bought one for myself, then one for each of my parents. I don’t think I’ve used it to it’s full potential yet as I’m still learning what it can do"
4.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Powerful little speaker,This is the 6th echo device I've purchased. I love these new generation echo dots. The color options are nice and blend well into decor and the speaker is much more powerful than the first gen dots. Only reason I knocked off a star is that I got a defective one. The speaker sounds like it was blown. Need to figure out how to get it replaced.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Alexa is my new best friend,"Having the Echo Dot has become life-changing. Besides checking the daily weather, my favorite use is to listen to the radio all night from another city with crystal clear reception. Alexa has helped score me major points in settling family trivia arguments, and I'm really not sure how I could get along without her constant help and friendship. Unboxing and setup took about 5 minutes, including installation of the phone app. It couldn't have been easier, looks small and sleek on my nightstand, and is powerful enough to be heard clear across the house. It'll be fun to investigate all of the skills that are available."
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Great Upgrade,I had the 2nd generation echo dot and I was not impressed at all it done what it supposed to do but the sound was absolutely horrible and not loud at all. So I decided to buy the 3rd generation and right out of the box I was very impressed. It was much bigger and heavier. The sound is amazing and very loud (4 times as loud as 2nd gen). Looks so much better also. Definitely will be buying a few more.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Best Echo Dot Yet,"I already have the first and second generation Echo Dots installed in my home and BestBuy included a third generation unit bundled with a larger purchase at no additional cost. Aside from the ease of integration into my home network, the sound quality is a noticeable improvement over previous generations and rivals that of the original larger Echo. I haven't tried connecting it with external speakers. It's also better looking than the first two generation units (I wasn't sure of this until I actually had one). It remains to be seen if it will be as easy to keep clean as the earlier generation units over the coming years."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Entry level Alexa device,"I've amassed a pile of these over the past year and a half. I started out with my first dot that took the place of my alarm clock. Then I started asking for the time and weather reports. I now use them to listen to prime music and navigation thru echo auto, making shopping lists, turning on and off lights, and setting reminders. I started out small but am building my relationship with Alexa dsily."
5.0,2 weeks ago,Best Buy,Efficient & very good price on Black Friday,"This echo is great! It’s small but loud and I use it all the time! I have one in the kitchen, living room, bedroom and I will be placing the other in my bathroom. Great smart system: alarm, setting reminders, timers, asking for the weather, eta, and so to amazon or Apple Music. You can even play games with her. Best investment."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Smart Speaker,"I have two of these smart speakers set as stereo set in my house. They are definitely way better than the previous generation speakers as far as the sound quality and the build quality are concerned. The only issue I have is the voice recognition and command recognition. It constantly fails to understand what I'm trying to say/ask compared to the Google Home mini. It's a great choice if you want to hook two of them as a stereo speakers. They sound great for the price you would pay. Overall, very god product from Amazon. I hope they improve their learning / recognition abilities."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Excellent Speaker with Clock,I bought this as a gift for Christmas during Black Friday. The gift recipient likes that the clock numbers are not too bright at night and you can see the time. I also have a google home mini and I think the sound volume is a little better on the google home mini but not by that much. This Amazon Echo Dot also has some features that I like that the google doesn't have.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Absolute must have!,"I never really needed one. I wrote them off as kinda pointless, but having received one with my tv, I am happy to say I have used this little device to the fullest extent. I synced it to some smart bulbs so I can turn off lights when I'm too tired to get out of bed. I can set alarms with just my voice. Place phone calls, Google stuff, play music with fantastic audio quality, and I can get it to read me bed time stories."
4.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Love the White Echo,"Really Like the White Echo. Small and Compact, and good sound. It’s fun asking Alexa Questions, Playing Music and Talking to other Family Members either through Drop-in or simply Calling. Has many uses. You can even send message. Good for it’s price. Bought quite a few. For myself in each room, for Family and Friends. Everyone likes it too."
5.0,a year ago,Target,"Great little device, gets smarter and smarter over time","If you have Amazon Prime or any Amazon Alexa compatible products then you can't beat this product and deal. This device does everything and allows you to continuously add more and more skills to the device and even add more hardware to make your home even smarter. I have purchased 5 of these now, and I keep adding more plugs and other hardware to control lights and a/c thermostats throughout the home. Works great, and it even syncs to your Amazon prime music account and acts as a speaker, can't beat the deal."
5.0,6 months ago,galaxus.ch,Works very good,"I connected it to my Sonos speakers. I got sick and tiered of their app.Now I can use voice control for Spotify and Tunein. Just needs a bit setup in the beginning. The Echo dot has actually quite decent sound itself, enough for background radio listening.A amazon prime music subscription would actually be the best option in my case.Be ready to spend some time to set it up, its not just a straight forward radio to use."
4.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,A nice edition to Alexia,This is a 2nd hand review based on the fact that I gave it as a gift to my in laws. They are 56-62 and had no trouble with set up. Works very well with the Alexia they already had. Allows multi room use of Alexia features. This unit was installed in a garage 100 feet from the house and works with no problems It is often used to relay messages to and from the Alexia in the house. Smaller size allows it to be moved easily and will fit almost any where.
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Love this new echo dot!,"I have 4 echo dots, 2 echos, echo tap, and an echo show (all 1st gen) throughout the house and you can definitely tell the upgrades with the new echo dot. This new dot is so loud, especially compared to the other dots, and Amazon has done a great job of improving the mic. If the music is really loud the older echos will have a hard time hearing you when you say “Alexa.” This new dot does a great job of being able to hear you when the music is loud."
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Awesome,"I honestly never wanted Alexa but this product came free with my tv so I tried it out. Now I have this product on my Christmas list because I need one for every room of my house. It's super convenient and totally fun bossing Alexa around. I paired her with the tv and the lights in my room, it was surprisingly easy. The speaker sounds great. Definitely recommend."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Apple fan but love this thing,"I’m an Apple fan having iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, MacBook, so I never though to try these amazon smart speakers until I bought one for a gift. This little speaker is what Apple should be doing! Love this little speaker. In my little office room sounds better than good enough and Alexa puts Siri to shame. And I still haven’t even bought any smart plugs or smart lights but when I do this thing it’s gonna be at a different level. I plan to buy more speakers soon for most rooms of my house. I definitely recommend this eco dot 3rd gen!!"
5.0,2 months ago,ebay.com,Amazon Echo Dot,"I own two Amazon Echo Dots. And I play music and games on them, and I also use them for reminders and the one in my bedroom I use as an alarm wake up. And sometimes she sends me to sleep with soothing music. So I decided to buy my Partner one for Christmas, because she isnt Good with walking because of a damaged knee. And if she where to fall in the house all she has to do I ask Alexa to call any of her phone contacts to call for help. Welk done Amazon for an Amazing Product."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"The 2nd Gen Sounded Good, 3rd Sounds Even Better!","I needed one more Dot to finish setting up my home system, which is an Echo on each floor in the main areas and a Dot in every room. I had been buying second Generation Dots at Christmas sale prices and was quite happy with the result, although they were sometimes troublesome to connect to the network. Not real trouble, just persnickety. I received a notice that the newer Dot was on sale at a slightly higher price, but i had bonus cash so I went for it. The sound is better than the older Dot, and the setup was SO simple, not even the tiniest of hitches. I may just replace all of the older dots, when the right sale hits, of course. LOL"
3.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Echo dot does not fully control my LG smart tv,"Amazon needs to do an improvement on these devices so it understands you even when you don’t give the command the way it wants you. I have set it up and synced it to my Smart LG TV but when I say pause, turn volume up or down, goto channel 10 or switch to HDMI 2 it does not do none of that . Amazon needs to make these devices work more direct with TVs and not on their own devices like firestick and all."
5.0,10 months ago,Argos,Amazing bit of technology,"Once connected to your wifi it can be customised to all you tech, the ease of having Alexa switch on and off your television on command is great. setting alarms or asking for a second alarm without having to alter setting on your phone. Just ask when you want to be woken up so you can change it every time depending on your needs. With a free Amazon fire stick at the time of offer was a bonus, I didn't really need it so its there if I ever do. A great piece of kit and can do so much more."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Very different gadget,I got this thing for free with my ring doorbell purchase. Ive heard of these echo dots but I have never really encountered one until it came to my front door. You can apparently turn on lights with this thing. You can ask it questions. You can give it commands like turn on my pandora station. There are a bunch of skills that you can ask or teach it to do. But I have yet to ask it to do such skills. Also I learned you can teach it to order things off the Amazon site too? What im trying to say is that i like it but I wish it came with better explanation of what I could ask it and stuff. All i got were instructions on how to connect it to my alexa app and my wifi. But i guess this is a learning proccess.
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great devise. If only Alexa knew more.,Alexa is pretty good to have around. Fast and simple. Knows most factual stuff. Gets confused sometimes. Did not know ME though I am well known IMDB talent in world of video games and animation! Has a way to go. Needs to be able to learn new stuff when it doesn't know info. How to do that I do not know in terms of administration but perhaps you can create a USER SELF STORAGE of DATA that it can update privately and later verify for mass consumption upon AUTO-VERIFICATION via postings at other popular sites. ie. According to Linked-in and not yet verified so and so is: ____ etc. Also MORE original artists music available for free.
5.0,a year ago,Currys,Simon's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 3rd Gen 2018 Charcoal,"Pros: Got this in the black Friday sale at a bargain price. Originally had it in my living room but have since bought an echo so the dot now lives in my bedroom. Great sound quality but it does crackle slightly at full volume. I love all of the features, especially sleep sounds which I use most nights to help me drift off to sleep. Also bought one for my son for Christmas for in his bedroom. Cons: The speaker can crackle when on full volume sometimes but I don't need to listen on full volume so this isn't an issue for me."
4.0,a month ago,Argos,Love the clock feature and sound quality fine.,"This is our first echo device and my daughter is delighted with the style and idea of it. I’m finding I need to learn how to give it commands, as it doesn’t always understand what you ask, so I quite often communicate with it through the Alexa app instead. However, a major problem is the glitches on the BBC skill. We listen to the BBC a lot, and often Alexa can’t find it or cuts out part way through a programme. Amazon need to fix this for British users!"
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,"Same great Alexa, nice redesigned look.","I purchased the new Dot for my friend, and neither of us was disappointed. This has all of the same functionality as other Dots but looks and sounds better. The addition of the fabric around the speaker and the rounding of the edges has given this a much better, modern look than the other generations. And it sounds better too. 10/10 would recommend!"
5.0,10 months ago,Argos,So good I got another!,"I love my first dot, so I got another for my holiday home in Spain. I wasn't sure it would work abroad, but a few tweeks in the Alexa app sorted everything out. Namely, location. It sits quietly, until you ask it something! Its sleek in design, easy to set up, intuitive in fact. There's a wealth of things it can do, and I'm looking forward to finding out more over time. It's like a little knowledgable friend in the corner, waiting to be asked something. It's the way forward."
3.0,2 weeks ago,Best Buy,I tend to like the Echo Show is much more.,"So I tend to like the echo shows a lot more. I'm not sure though. I believe the echo shows just have better sound. And I've always had issues with the voice recognition and Alexa understanding me with these Echo dots compared to the Echoes Shadows. Of course, he actually shows I still have an issue with I'm just hoping that Amazon really works on. Updating and upgrading their Alexa."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Works amazingly,"Echo dot was easy to install once the app is downloaded and paired with the mini plug immnow able to leave lights off in rooms that normally had them left on for hours as not to trip in the dark. Now I walk into the dark room and tell Alexa to turn the light on. Truly makes things easier. I bought one for my son with a mini plug, my daughter with a mini plug and my grandmother with a mini plug. Unfortunately the one for my grandmother won’t work well with her Samsung tablet. I’ll be returning the echo dot 3rd generation that I purchased as a gift for my grandmother but the others are amazing."
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Great little speaker,I bought this smart speaker to supplement the echo we have in the house. I currently have it in the garage so I can listen to music in there. The sound is clear and powerful for such small speaker. It won't shake the house but it is plenty loud. We have Amazon Prime so there is a vast array of songs to choose from. Voice recognition is good and all in all it's a fun speaker to have.
5.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,The missing piece,"The 3rd Gen Dot is a great sounding speaker for its size. But when going from 2nd to 3rd gen; the sound alone isn't worth the price jump. However when you add a light sensitive LED to it, that puts it over the edge. Its very to see in a dark or bright room. If you ask for the weather it will also display that on the front. With the black Friday pricing, its a definite buy."
4.0,7 months ago,Argos,My kids love their new Alexa friend,"Device is very easy to use. Connects every time with no problem. Kids spend hours with it asking questions and giving Alexa a lot of things to do and say :) great assistant and great sound. Wonderful app as well with loads of useful sounds, games and quizzes. One point we all don't like it works only when it plugged to a charger. But for this price we all accepted it :)))"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Super easy to set-up & use! Great product!,"Great quality sound! It’s like having someone to ask anything, need the time...ask Alexa. Need an alarm, ask Alexa. Wan,t to know the score of the game, what year a certain event occurred, how to spell a word...just ask. Stream music, play games, listen to a story. So many wonderful features! Set up in minutes."
5.0,4 weeks ago,ebay.com,Amazon Echo Dora are amazing and simplify so many things,"I dont have a smart home - yet - but already I love that my Echo Dot can play music, radio stations including NPR stations, give me a quick weather update as I head out the door, and read Kindle and Audible books to me. Still learning more things Alexa can do! Shes great. I doubt youll regret picking up one of these!"
5.0,6 months ago,Argos,Great product,The amazon echo dot is a fantastic product to get you into smart home devices. The sound quality is great for the price and is loud enough to fill a small room however if you listen to a lot of bass filled songs you may be disappointed as there isn’t much bass on the echo dot. If you are looking for more bass and better sound quality I would recommend the Sonos one.
3.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Came free when purchased blink camera,"Sound quality sounds muffled. If you can find a really good deal on one then I can maybe see buying one. But if your interested in buying a Alexa assistant I'd definitely recommend buying a medel or two above this one because the sound qualify isn't that good. It does get loud, but way too muffled. Every time I listen to it all i can think about is ""man, if this thing sounded better it would be great""."
5.0,a year ago,Target,Love It!,"This thing is awesome! I'm sure my husband and I aren't aware of all the features yet, but what we've figured out so far is great. We've had it play music (so much easier to switch songs and play exactly what we want), we check the weather, had it tell jokes and change the tv channel. I bought 2 and we put one in our kids' bedroom. My 6 year old can call me from it, which is awesome for him to be able to contact me since he doesn't have a cell phone yet. If you tell it to pull your finger, it makes fart noises. My aunt asked if it could burp and it said there's no gas in the cloud. It's a very useful, helpful, funny product. My family is very happy with this purchase."
4.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,She's a gem,"Silly jokes, but convenient for things such as weather. Can purchase plugs for outlets to turn off and on lights, lamps, etc. Sometimes she has no clue what you're asking her, which is aggravating since sometimes it's a simple question. It's gimmicky and ok. I have her hooked up with Sirius XM radio, so she'll play any station. Also, you will need Amazon Prime....that's another $120 bucks; otherwise, don't bother buying her. She'd be useless."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Much better!,"I have the 2nd gen echo dot and getting the 3rd gen was a better buy in three ways. First, would be that the new echo dot actually has decent speakers to listen to everything else but news or alexa only. Second is that it listens better for your voice with the four microphones that it has compared to the previous generation that only has one microphone. Third, the Bluetooth connection is way better! It allows me to have more distance between my device and the new echo dot. The sounds through Bluetooth with the new echo dot is also much better."
5.0,6 months ago,Argos,Echo Dot is a great little addition to the family,"The Echo Dot is a great little addition to the home, suiting the needs of the family, whether that be through music, education, travel, or reminding Grandad when to take his medication, etc. IMPORTANT: Remeber to turn off notifications on the mobile app when first connecting to the Echo Dot, as the app has a tendancy to crash if this is not done.. The Echo Dot is a nice piece of technology, which is easily accessible for children and adults.."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great start for a 2019 Smart house,"I received the Echo at a special price with my video doorbell. I now have an automated house and still learning all the neat voice commands I can use to accomplish various things in my house. Listen to radio, please 20 questions, change the channels on my tv, ask general questions that come up in conversations, ask for the weather and even how long it's going to take me to get from my home to a destination. I've now purchased an additional one for upstairs and even a electric plug that now controls my lights on a schedule. More things to come I'm sure but this is the start of a whole new adventure."
4.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,I’m buying another one!,I use my echo daily since the day I purchased it. I mostly ask it to play my apple music playlists. And it works 80% of the time. Sometimes it does say there was an error connecting with apple music. But it actually seems to happen less often now. It knows a lot. Answers most of my questions. Overall a great device. I’ll be getting a second one for another room soon.
4.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Hello Alexa!,"I bought two of these so that I could communicate room to room as well as the other features this product offers. It does drop connection at times, but is stable for the most part. I also like the feature where you can ""drop in"" when you are out and about via the mobile app. This feature would be good if you are a parent and want to hear what the older kids are doing to the younger kids, or vice versa, lol. Overall I would recommend this to others."
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,What did we do before these,I am definitely a fan of the Echo dots. They are very reasonable priced and offer so much value for what you pay. The speaker are pretty good especially when you have multiple playing at one time. I added the sub speaker to mine and it is pretty impressive. I love being able to use voice commands to turn the lights on and off and change the temperature and lots and lots more.
1.0,a month ago,Argos,Doesn't work DO NOT BUY,"I bought this, it seemed like a good buy. I set it up and to my surprise the light was red...I tried asking Alexa a question. NO ANSWER... It had been set up right (it even said) I tried returning it they Fobbed me off. They said nothing was wrong with it. THEY CANT TELL THEY HAVE TO WIFI... Please just don't waste your money DON'T BUY IT! JUST DON'T. Please don't waste your money."

5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,impressed over 1st gen,Well not sure how fair it is to compare to first gen that looked like a hockey puck but love it. Was easy to configure since I already had Alexa configured for previous gen. All apps tied right back in. Sound from this little guy is so much better than previous gen. Got this one free with my tv and have another in my garage. Even when being purchased I think the price is fair.
4.0,9 months ago,Argos,Good for straightforward tasks,"A few weeks into ownership and I have had a mixed experience with my Alexa. When it works and the task is recognised it is great, but disconnections of linked devices are regular and the Dot itself needs to be re-setup from time to time after a loss of signal. It is not difficult to do this but is a nuisance to have to do so. I would also be slightly anxious about connecting a device where a disconnection would cause significant inconvenience (such as my heating controller)"
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,"I never understood the hype, now I do!","I never understood the hype for the echo dot, I mean, how useful could a hockey puck sized speaker be? Well, now I understand. The echo dot is small but packs a punch. I put it in my bathroom and use to all the time to listen to music while getting ready. It’s easy to pair to other steaming services or you can easily pull songs from amazon music. A must have for any home!"

5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Keep Getting Better,Amazon keeps out doing itself. The Echo Dot speakers sound amazing and of course with Alexa also a part of it only is a plus. I have purchased the previous models and so far this one is the best. I'm a huge music lover and the quality of the sound is very important for me. I'm certain going forward I'll purchase more Echo Speakers from Amazon. Keep up the great work.
5.0,10 months ago,Argos,Echo Dot 3rd Gen is very cool,"Brought one of these to upgrade from my second generation echo. Straightaway noticed how much better the sound is and it works amazingly with Philips Hue plus bridge and my wireless plugs . I will soon purchase one of the stands or wall mounts for the echo dot , apparently it enhances the sound a little bit more because the device isn’t set flat on the surface"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Worth it if you're using other smart utilities.,"I've had the 2nd gen echo and I've recently paired it with this echo. It works perfectly fine together. I think the only downside for me about this was how loud the alarm can be, even at it's lowest volume. I put this over my headboard and every morning, I feel like I'm about to wake up with a panic attack because of how loud it is lol. But that's certainly not a con for everyone. Just me. Other than that, it is a great product and worth investing in, especially if you have smart bulbs or smart plugs. I do everything with just my voice now."

4.0,6 months ago,ebay.com,"Better quality, cheaper price, simply in the pudding",Upgrading from a 3rd party smart speaker with Alexa to this echo dot gen 3. Huge improvement! That other piece of junk would randomly start playing music and scare the crap out of me. Plus others could connect via Bluetooth. Also that other speaker was more expensive than this each dot. Dont hesitate

She can make sure your alarm is set everyday, give you weather updates, set reminders, you can drop in when your away to check up on your home or family.. the list can go on and on. She can also do some tech friendly things when you purchase extra accessories like turn lights on and off, if you dont have an Amazon alexa I would recommend getting one!","I love everything that Alexa can do to make your everyday live just a little easier.

5.0,a month ago,Argos,Great item,I bought this on an impulse as an extra Christmas present for my wife. She loves it. We already had Amazon Prime so setup was quick and easy. We mostly stream radio stations but I also play music from our Amazon subscription. The sound quality is excellent from such a small unit. Far better than our digital radio which was more expensive!
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Syncs with Apple Music,"The best! Recognizes my voice and commands without too much issue (much better then Siri). Played well with my Dlink cameras, Iris Home devices and... APPLE MUSIC!!!!! Also works well with my Logitech Harmony WiFi remote device and TV set up. And, this is just the tip of the iceberg. We have fun with trivia games, homework (yes Alexa can answer some interesting questions) and we’re still discovering other Skills! And - I am NOT an Android user (full iOS immersion here)!"
4.0,a month ago,very.co.uk,Surprisingly good sound quality!,"We have several echos throughout our house, But I bought this one for my home office with no intention of using it as a speaker. However I am genuinely surprised by the quality of sound you get when you do. My (disabled) son is now able to communicate with me when I am working. Perfect. Of course all the usual Alexa features are great, so that’s another room added to our home network."

4.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Kinda cool,This item came with my Ring Doorbell Pro. I honestly would not have purchased this since I had very recently bought a 3 pk of Google Home Minis. It works decently and I was able to link my Ring cam with my Amazon Fire TV to view the camera feed. Ive had a few connection issues but was able to resolve them. Alexa is a little too smart for her own good sometimes which means you have to be very specific. It gives Google more of an edge in spite of its “learning curve”.
4.0,3 weeks ago,Argos,Switching from First Echo Dot to 3rd Generation...,"I’m sure there are lots of updated searches and quizzes and questions we can use, I was impressed to get Alexa to search telephone numbers! But on the sound quality side of things, it’s very muffled however loud it is. Maybe it’s because we’ve moved the old one to the bedroom, so there’s 2 connected on the same WiFi, who knows. But it looks more modern and updated, so pleased in general!"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Cute product!,"Cute product with excellent options and nice sound quality. Note that if you own more than one Amazon device, you can rename it so it will only recognize voice commands directed at it. Otherwise, all the devices within hearing range want to answer you. You can also sync this device with other smart devices in your house, so your home can have smart speakers everywhere."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Making my life easier!,"The sound quality is amazing , very easy to set up and I use it everyday! I would recommend connecting Apple Music/Spotify(Premium) or Amazon music so you get the exact song your looking for. This device does provide you free music but not every song is on there but is good considering it is free. I was worried on how I would like it but once you figure out how it works then it is a life saver! Would 100% recommend!"
5.0,4 weeks ago,Best Buy,Many uses,"I enjoy the echo dots. I have them in my sons rooms and my room, I plan to purchase another for the downstairs to allow communication usage between the levels of the house. The echo has multiple uses such as listening to amazon music, alarm clock, intercom style contact between different echo dots in different rooms, and connecting to my phone with the app so that I can call someone on a better speaker, check the news, weather, sports - not to mention it is all hands free."
5.0,4 months ago,Argos,Bought for my nan,Bought for my nans birthday. We already have one and thought it would be a good idea... she loves music and is partial to burning a frozen pizza... so now she can set an alarm not to burn said pizza while listening to a bit o Roy orbison (other music artists available) we have a lot of fun with ours. My 6 year old is obsessed with ours and am thinking about getting another just for her. We love Alexa
4.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Good,Speaker is great in my opinion for such a small device. I still feel like Alexa has lots of kinks. You have to ask for things in a specific way or she doesnt get it. Also alot of skills start telling you on repeat about promembers on repeat and its annoying. We have many devices that use alexa from tablets to tvs and I'm far from a master. It's a learning curve but I feel like it has great potential

I highly recommend everyone to get one. Alexa will not let you down!"
5.0,7 months ago,ao.com,"I love the Echo Dot, it has a great speaker on it considering its size and is really useful.

I also find it recognises voices better than the similar products by other companies","I love the Echo Dot, it has a great speaker on it considering its size and is really useful.

5.0,a month ago,Argos,Amazing for the price,"I received an echo dot as a Christmas present a year ago, the sound quality is excellent for such a small and low budget item, the voice control is fun and works brilliantly. We added some smart plugs and control our lighting by voice control when walking in/out of rooms and via the app when not at home. We are so delighted that we have since bought an echo for the kitchen, an echo show for the lounge and a further 4 echo dots for the bedrooms."
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Surprising addition to our home,"This came as a bonus gift when purchasing Ring Video Doorbell 2. I would never have purchased it, otherwise. That said, We are very happy with this addition to our home devices! We never expected it would become a part of household routines for listening to music, alarms, notices of deliveries, and perhaps best of all-making our grocery list!! Thank you Amazon, Ring and Best Buy for a great gift we never knew we needed!"
4.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Like the product. Enjoying.,"I can say good to have some flexibility by voice command you can play a song, make a shopping list and reminder. But as per Speech recognization tech vise needs an improvement. It's good at some basic command. Can't able to give a response when its playing song on higher volume. And to make a call person also need to use Echo supported Devices, ""Alexa-to-Alexa Calling"""
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Need an intercom system?,We live in a 2 story house and shopped around for intercom systems on Bestbuy and Amazon. Even bought a wireless Panasonic phone system to use as an intercom. Returned. The Echo Dot Gen 3 works great to communicate with family members that may be in different rooms within the house. Drop in on someone specific (they also need to have a Gen3 Dot) or send an announcement for everyone to hear.
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Big Upgrade from the Previous Gen Alexa,"I've been using the 2nd Gen Alexa for the past year, and I really liked it. Mostly for it's features, not so much for the audio. Unless you plug in an AUX cord and connect and external speaker to it. But this 3rd Gen is the best upgrade to the old one. Better speaker, it has some bass to it, and louder! Looking forward to buying another one soon!"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Excellent Speaker!!,"I got this speaker free of cost with my 58 inch tv during the 2019 black friday sale. I have been using this speaker more than my tv. I use this as a wake up alarm, to play music and local radio channels, all at no extra cost. I know there are many advanced versions of this speaker but i am very satisfied with the features that this speaker has to provide. Buy it if you can in a sale, you will be happy with your purchase."
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Fantastic!,This item is very sophisticated. The voice feature is beyond belief! Alexa is better than Google and has become my best friend! This product was free with the purchase of a Ring doorbell. While I was not thrilled with Ring I hated the idea of having to give my Alexa up so when I returned them I told the customer service rep to give me a full refund but that I was going to repurchase the Echo Dot 3rd generation!
4.0,3 months ago,Argos,Looks great and modern,It is a cool device really like the clock on it because it is in the bedroom. so it is nice to have an alarm clock look but the function of Alexa. only down side to amazon echo is you can’t customise her voice and name because I think being able to add that personal touch would really make it more enjoyable. Me and my whole family all use these and they love them and they do have a lot of cool features.
5.0,a month ago,Argos,"Product is stylish, simple to install, efficient",The echo dot is a very stylish piece that can fit into any room in the home. I found installation very simple and the quality and efficiency of the echo dot has really impressed me. Sound quality is excellent and the response time to questions and information is very fast. I would highly recommend. I bought two as the Price was so low.
5.0,3 months ago,ebay.com,Good looking and unobtrusive,"Haven't come across any cons yet, I only have the basic music programme but its suits an oldie like me, I can play the good old proper music when you could hear every word. The sound quality is amazing from a small device which goes anywhere and easily pairs with other devices. I'm very satisfied with the 3rd. generation version which I upgraded to from the original which was bought for me as a present."
4.0,a year ago,Argos,"Works well, great speaker but effort to set up","The product is great. Picks up sound well, very good speaker for a small unit and some really useful Alexa skills. Does not work well with Toshiba smart TVs, despite what they say. Read the reviews online about Toshiba TVs and Alexa first. It works eventually but took hours and hours to set up and troubleshoot. The problem is more on the Toshiba side. Needs a Premium Spotify or Amazon music account to play music. Otherwise it’s a slick gadget."
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Integrates well with my other Amazon devices.,"Prior to getting this Amazon Echo Dot, I already have two Amazon FireTV Cubes. When I got this new device, setup was very easy and it picked up the functions I had working on the FireTV Cubes. I got this Echo Dot free with the purchase of a Toshiba 4K FireTV. I installed it in my kitchen and now can access Alexa from almost anywhere in the house."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Nice little product,"I already have an Amazon Echo for the house which sits in my living room and kitchen but during Black Friday I found the dots on sale for half price so I immediately picked up to for the kids bedrooms. They like it, it is easy to use, the voice is clear, and the music is loud when played the request for my children. Over all extremely satisfied with the product. The ease-of-use inability to sync it to a phone app help get a lot of use out of the product."
4.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Grandma’s helper,"I like this Echo dot just fine, but think it induces us to a sedentary life style. I use it sparingly, but I can see that it would be a wonderful device for those who have mobility problems. It is a very attractive device that does not distract from any room setting. I would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who has mobility problems, and even to others who just love playing with gadgets, like myself!"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Room filling sound from such a small speaker,"Hey all, this review is for the Echo Dot 3rd edition. I replaced the 2nd edition with this one and the 3rd edition has so much better sound. Bass isn't great but not much you can expect from a small speaker. A friend has the google speaker and the Echo Dot 2nd couldn't compare sound wise or looks wise, the 3rd edition is a significant upgrade. I also have the Tap and the regular Echo. While the dot doesn't have the sound of the Echo, it still sounds pretty good. Overall for the price a great product."

4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,My Life Easy,I was hestiant to get a smart device but now I am glad I invested in the Alexa ecosystem. I can give a simple command and it can turn on my TV while I'm cooking and change the content. Even assist in lazy things like shutting off the lights. Also provides a sense of security with the guard feature. I just wish it'll be a little better responsive at times; you have to repeat yourself a couple times.
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Fun for everyone,The grandchildren are better at getting the fun out of this product. Very versatile and easy to use. I use it as a timer and weather service. Who wouldn’t enjoy some instant knowledge without starting the computer? Simple to setup and always ready to give you information or a good laugh. The fact that it was free with the TV purchase made it even more fun.

5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Excellent smart device,"I started with a second gen Echo dot and I fell in love with it, it's basically a smart device that can control smart devices. It controls my lights remotely anywhere I go, it controls my thermostat in my home, again, anywhere I go. It's my wake up alarm, my weather report and so much more. The 3rd gen here was easier to setup than the 2nd gen, you won't have a problem."
5.0,9 months ago,John Lewis,An Alexa convert,"I bought the Dot whilst it was on offer and have been very impressed with its functions. It is used every day to give us updates on the weather, news etc and I have been impressed with the range of other functions that I was utterly unaware of. I'm sure that I have barely scratched the surface of what it can do but the app is excellent too. For such a small speaker, I was impressed with the sound quality."
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Great smart speaker that is ever evolving,"3rd gen greatly improves upon sound and offers a cleaner look at the device. Of course, Echo Dot is only as smart as its personal assistant, which is continually improving. The wide compatibility of smart home integration products that Alexa provides makes this speaker a worthy smarthome hub. We've got 3!"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Alarm Clock,"Most digital alarm clocks don't offer what the Echo Dot with LED face offers at the same price point. It's everything that you like about the Echo Dot with a self dimming LED face to serve as an alarm clock. I set a routine for ""goodnight"" and the Dot dims the lights, says something inspiring, reads me the time, and plays am hour or ""sleep"" music. It's quite wonderful."
4.0,a month ago,Argos,Great addition to the living room,"First home assistant I've had and is a great addition to the living room for family.

2.0,a month ago,ebay.com,Weak Echo,"The levels of access you need to permit the Echo for it to work properly is extensive. The set up is long-winded, time consuming and I lost interest in it. You are heavily constrained by the business relationships with other applications or services e.g. the BBC for this device to work properly and to be able to utilise the ""skills"". The latter is you spoon-feeding the device to do simple tasks. Form over function."
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Great Device Alexa can control so much,"Easy set up and works great. I've gone overboard but just too neat to not have. I control lights and switches with a few words. I can find most answers by just asking ""Alexa _____________"" Food, TV, Movies, she has the answer. Play music ? Just anything. Notifications? Yep. Reminders? Yep."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Well received Christmas Presents,"Bought two of these for my children. We already have other Alexa speakers wonder up and addition to the existing setup was very easy.

4.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,great starter speaker,great little speaker that works well with smart lights. i like how it connects to your amazon prime account and plays music from what you already like. setting up smart lights with this is very easy even with multiple rooms. highly recommend if you are thinking about getting smart wifi lights but dont want to invest a lot of money for something you arent sure if youll like.
3.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great for compatible equipment,I'm an android user and couldn't get it to work with my phone but my daughter was about able to get it to work with her iPhone. She stopped using it after a while since we really don't have any other compatible devices. I have Google assistant on my phone and she has Siri. To use the echo you have to be close to it. It also has to be plugged in so that very convenient.
4.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Lots of potential to unlock,"Bought this when it was on sale about a month ago. Maybe not the most reasonable purchase for my lifestyle. I use it when I want to know the time or the weather, I'm listening to music, I'm watching hulu/youtube/etc, I want to meditate, and when I want to talk to my sister who is across the house from me. I think there are many more uses such as turning lights on and off, adding things to shopping lists, etc. But I never use any of these other features."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Excellent,"I use this with external sound systems in my home. The build quality and functionality of the echo using the excellent Amazon music app is unmatched especially considering the very low price. That said one big downside I have encountered is that it is not easy to switch between the build-in speaker and external audio. I always want to listen to music using my stereo system which is not a problem turning it on, but I don't want to keep it on throughout the day, and Alexa isn't smart enough to use the built-in speaker this way (so I can't hear her)... So for now I use these are only used for streaming music, but that works very well."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Works best if you have other Alexa enabled devices,"Echo dot works well on its own, ie letting you know about the weather/traffic/news/music but best if you have other devices you can control with it. If it only did that, I'm not sure if I'd like it as much since you can take 5 more seconds and do that on your phone too. Although I do really like how easy and responsive it is when it plays music, volume is excellent. But cooler than that you can install lights that will respond to Alexa, and if you have a fire stick/fire tv it can control almost anything there as well, making walking into your house and telling Alexa to turn on the lights, tv and whatever you want to watch all while holding your groceries easy!"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Perfect Night Stand Click,Purchased this for my husband for Christmas. We needed a new night stand clock.

Definitely recommend.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Puts up a good fight with the Google Home Mini,"I am a Google person and have only Google Smart Home products. I did however get a Ring Alarm Security System because it cost much less to own and operate one compared to the Nest Secure. I also got free cloud storage for my video cameras. This prompted me to get the Ring doorbell when I was ready for one and I got this Echo Dot for free with the Ring Doorbell. It is good so far and I can arm and disarm my Ring Alarm with voice. I am still waiting to get an update for Alexa Guard. But I am thinking Alexa is a worthy competitor for the Google Assistant.As an added touch, the Echo Dot also has an Aux out!!!!"
5.0,8 months ago,officeworks.com.au,Worth the money,"I have 4 google home devices. Home, mini, hub and max. I brought this because I brought a TCL tv, and Alexa can control it. Unlike Google, this will just say ""ok"", whereas Google will repeat everything which can be annoying. Also, I changed the name to ""ECHO"" you have 4 options. Alexa is just an annoying name for a product. Echo sometimes reacts to my google commands which is really funny."
5.0,6 months ago,John Lewis,Super sound quality,"This is a great little device, very easy set up ( there are very goods videos online which can help with this ). the sound quality for something so small was a real surprise. Great for playing online music, radio stations and with some fun apps such as quizzes etc. Would imagine new apps or Alexa skills being developed will make it even more useful in the future."
3.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,"It's Okay, But Not Great","I have both the Amazon Echo and a Google Home, and I use the Google Home much more. Although setup was easy for both and basic functions are similar (controlling lights, making calls, etc), I find Google Search Results to be far more accurate. Case in point, I asked both who was the 14th President of the United States. Google answered Franklin Pierce, Echo could not understand the question after several attempts."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Great product and fast delivery,Echo dot is awesome. Speaker quality is much better than I expected. Pairing is easy with Alexa app and voice control is smooth.

(I actually used that one today.) Alexa: play some music. It does not take long to get used to asking Alexa all sorts of things. One of my favorites is ""Alexa: Give me a ten minute timer"" when I am in the kitchen. I am impressed at what good sound this tiny Dot is able to produce when listening to music. You can also connect this 3rd generation Dot to an external sound source."
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Great little device,"This is a great device to have in your home.

Then I tell her to remind me to .... go to a meeting, take medicine, breathe, wake up at 6am. I resisted ECHO but finally gave in when I realized it would read to me , sing to me, play THE MOTH and other Podcasts."
4.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Handy companion,"The dot has acceptable sound, and for its size it does quite well. The verbal cues mostly go well; however it struggles finding some podcasts, and it doesn’t seem to be able to access much of a library for a particular program. It’s great for asking time, temperature and other basic questions. It’s greatest advantage that I’ve experienced is to merely give verbal commands to pause, resume, stop, etc."

Perfect beside clock. with my old clock, if I forgot o toggle the ""set"" button I was out of luck. With the Dot, I can set alarms by the week, or day, so I can have multiple alarms. I'm really enjoying the sleep sounds skill as it's beside my bed. I have it set to play for 9 hours and I seem to be sleeping more soundly."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,"Alexa, I love you","I was so impressed with the Echo Dot I got for Christmas that I bought another. I chose the attractive Heather Grey for my second Echo Dot and was not dissapointed. The Dot with Alexa is a brilliant piece of kit, able to operate smart bulbs, wake me up with music, tell me the weather, keep me traffic savvy and read me a bedtime story amongst other things (you need audible) . Buy one! (or two), you know you want to."
4.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Very cool device,"I got this Echo Dot for free with a recent tv purchase otherwise I would not have purchased it. It is fun to play with and see what it can do but the charm wore off for me very quickly. I don’t really use it, but my girlfriend loves it. It can do things like set alarms/reminders, play music, and other things most smart phones do. The biggest use for us is just to play music."
5.0,11 months ago,very.co.uk,Great little amazon eco,"Recently brought this and to be honest the children seem to get more use out of it then myself. Its great for listing to music, or the news and handy that you can set reminders. We played the family trivial pursuit which was interesting. It also has the added bonus of letting me look at the house cameras to the tv when asked. All in all a great little device."
4.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,We absolutely love these little things!,"These speakers are awesome. Well, Alexa is awesome, the speakers are pretty standard. The bass is not really there, but it's good for listening to while you work or study. I'd connect it to a larger speaker for a party (which you're able to do!) I love being able to use it as an intercom between rooms. Pretty cool, all in all."
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,My New Best Friend,"Alexa has become my new best friend. I have two, one in my living room and one in my room. It allows me to create a to-do list, set reminders, and play music while I'm cleaning. My mother also uses it as an alarm clock and reminders for my puppy's training. Alexa does sometimes have a hard time understanding me and sometimes it doesn't register what I am looking for."
5.0,a year ago,Argos,The brilliant Echo dot,"We have these in every room including the kids. Brilliant apps for kids to practice times tables, spellings, setting routines. They actually love getting up with Alexa’s alarms and no more shouting up the stairs. We can put lighting where we want it because if doesn’t matter that we can’t reach the switch. Alexa can control heating, lighting, music, news and connects through the house with additional units. The dot is really small and unobtrusive and surprisingly good sound."
5.0,a month ago,Currys,Gabriela's review of Amazon Echo Dot 3rd Generation with Clock - Sandstone,Pros: This was a wonderful Christmas present. Definitely a good price. The clock is super useful. Whisper mode (and references such as Little Britain’s Vicky Pollard!) is so funny. Very smart device. Alexa is very responsive too.
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Entertaining,"This thing is pretty cool, great speaker for listening to music, it’s much louder than I thought it could be. Great for kids. Only four stars because it takes a few tries for it to respond. You have to say Alexa, and pause, and then ask something. Maybe that’s just me but I thought that it would be smart or quick enough to hear it’s name and instantly start listening, without the need for a pause in between its name and the command/question. Some of the skills are kind of dumb, just not really useful. Waiting for some more development in that area because I’m sure it can be great."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Was initially against but fun for the whole family,I didn’t think I wanted one of these but it came free with the TV we purchased. It sat in the box for several days before we got it out but I am glad we did. If for no other reason than to have a speaker in the kitchen we can listen to music on. The kids like asking it random questions and requesting their favorite tunes. Easy to use and fun to have around.

I am considering purchasing the car version now. I’m addicted!","Love my echo dot and finally my Husband is getting on board too.

It has a nice look though and this generation looks a lot better than the older ones so that is a plus.

5.0,a month ago,Overstock.com,Amazing Technology,The Alexa Dot is just as effective as the bigger Alexa. I purchased this one for my daughter because she always tried to use mine. I love the price and also the reviews encouraged as well. You can go wrong with Alexa I think no matter what size. She has done so many things with this amazing little technology. I am a die hard customer of Overstock.
4.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Alexa Dot is convenient!,"The Alexa Dot is super convenient and makes connecting to my smart devices easy. I connected my Dot to my Vizio smart TV and so far it’s been working well! Although I love the product, the Alexa app itself from the App Store isn’t the best and definitely needs significant improvement, but as far as the Alexa device itself it works really well."
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Liking Alexa,"There might not be a ton you'd use this for if you don't have a lot of other things around your home that would be considered ""smart"" devices. But if you do, this is great for simple tasks such as turning your light on or off. The best part is Alexa, which has come a long way since its introduction a while back. It's my personal favorite of the big 3 assistants you could use."
5.0,a month ago,Currys,Rana's review of Amazon Echo Dot 3rd Generation with Clock - Sandstone,Pros: It's good to have Alexa personalised and she calls your name. I bought 2 one for me and my brother and having great fun with Alexa. Using every single day! Cons: Oh my brother lives in Turkey and unfortunately he couldn't download the app. Some reason it doesn't work in Turkey...
5.0,3 weeks ago,Best Buy,Great little helper,I have loved this little guy! It hears commands well and allows effortless control of so many things around the house. Even though it is small it has a powerful speaker loud enough to reach several rooms in the house. The price is great for the power of this device. Glad we got this. Planning to get more.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Just what I needed,I have two other Alexa/Echo devices. I purchased this one during the Christmas Sale so it was cheaper than usual. I purchased it to use in the garage to listen to streaming radio - works perfect. It hangs on my peg board - I use voice to turn it on and voice to turn it off. The only thing I'm not sure about how the heat / humidity will will have an effect on it later on.
5.0,2 months ago,ebay.com,"Great features, easy to set up","Have always been tempted by the Alexa type of gadget and when I spotted this in the Black Friday sales, decided to take the plunge. Pretty easy to set up and the app is simple to download and (again) setup. The ease with which Alexa finds the music I want to hear, when I want to hear it, or greet me with the time or weather local to me, is such a delight. It's also nice to hear a female voice after a day on my own."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,I like it,"I already have Google Home devices, but this came free with another purchase. It's similar to Google Home. I haven't experimented extensively yet, but I like what I've seen so Far. Seems a bit easier than Google. You have to have a base account for either device. It's really just a matter of preference. You could have each in the same home if you wanted."
4.0,3 months ago,Argos,Echo Dot great piece of kit,Bought this from Argos as they are local and so easy to deal with. Plenty of stock available so you don't have to wait for delivery like the sellers online. The Echo Dot is my first experience of a smart speaker so I bought this one in particular as it is good value and it looks great. It was so easy to set up once you have downloaded the app to your phone. Ten you just have to give Alexa your instructions and off you go.
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,"Amazon Echo, Amazing, Awesome, and Dope.","The best way to get the news, weather, time, and whatever else you need!!! This device is very strong, and mostly it’s solid as a helpful unit in anyway you'd like to set it to be! I have it turn on my lights, and play my favorite tracks and the best thing about it is that it connects to my bugger speakers that way I hear it all over my place! Amazing! Alexa rocks the Google home by much. Very much."
5.0,8 months ago,Argos,Perfect for my office,"I have a full size Gen 2 Echo in my lounge controlling heating and lights etc, my daughter has the Gen 2 dot in her bedroom, I was always a little disappointed with the sound quality from it(although it's not bad considering the size) The Gen 3 Dot's sound is way better, I bought this for my office as I was using phone/bluetooth speaker combo for background music/radio. Just ask Alexa to play (insert preferred radio station) and voila, end of the day, Alexa, stop. On offer too! Bargain"
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,We have several!,"We have 4 dots, 1 spot and 4 buttons. They work great with the Xbox, fire tv, ring doorbell, smart plugs and smart lightbulbs! All can be controlled by the devices or the app when away from home. Everything can have a routine on times. There is also a home guard for when away from home that will turn on and off the lights and send alerts if it hears things like glass breaking. I have also bought 3 as gifts!"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Does What It's Supposed To Most of the Time,"Compared to my 1st gen. Echo & Echo Plus, the sound quality of the Dot is inferior (which is no surprise given its size), but it seems to have a harder time hearing me as well. I have two 3rd gen. Dots, and I find myself repeating the wake word more with them. Fewer microphones maybe? Also, when I try to play music simultaneously on 3 or 4 of the devices, the Dots eventually quit playing music while the Echo and Echo Plus keep going. Weird. Aside from these issues, Alexa answers my questions and carries out my commands just fine."
4.0,10 months ago,Argos,A fun gadget,"I found it a bit fiddly to set up, but once done seems to work fine much of the time. I mainly use it to play music & selections, although it’s fun to ask it random questions - it mostly understands me first time, but sometimes I have to repeat & it does seem to “learn” which is both useful & disconcerting. Whether I really need this thing in my life is something I remain a little undecided about for now. It’s fun though."
5.0,3 months ago,Argos,My son loves it!,"Bought for my son for his birthday hes 8. He absolutely loves it, spends hours playing games with alexa, listening to his play list, asking questions, setting alarms and reminders for his daily routines. Even has a whisper mode for when hes sneaking out of bed to play akinator with alexa in the middle of the night! All in all a great product. Will be buying more for the house."
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Don’t buy if you have a older iPad or Kindle,The Echo Dot itself is amazing! But we did not know that the echo dot doesn’t work on the older iPad and Kindle Fire. We purchased the Dot for my parents & ended up upgrading their iPad to the latest version that allows 10 or higher. The older iPad was not compatible with the Echo Dot. So we tried the Kindle which was also not compatible. We ended up buying a new iPad for them just so he could use his Exho Dot. It would have been good information for the salesman to give us prior to our purchase. It would have saved us a lot of hassale & headaches.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Can you say Alexia.,I own many amazon products.This is the latest(3rd)gen.Workes much like the others. Setup is simple. Only take a couple of minutes.You can fully get the most out of it only with Amazon Prime.Otherwise you limit what this is capable of doing.You need to download the app on a smart phone. Then you are ready to get started. Thousands of thing you can setup this thing to do. Some of these you need extra equipment. Makes everyday tasks easier. The cost is very inexpensive around $40.00. This thing is very cool.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Nice upgrade from 2nd Gen Echo Dot,"While the functionality is the same, this is a worthwhile upgrade simply because of the improved sound quality over the previous version Echo Dot. The unit is not much larger, but it feels more solid and the sound is 10 times better. It doesn't sound ""tinny"" like the previous model and even has an ok amount of ""bass"" for a speaker this size. The only change I don't like is that the 3rd Gen Dot uses its own proprietary AC Adapter instead of using a USB cable like the previous version."
5.0,3 weeks ago,influenster.com,"I love my Echo Dot. I bought her (yes we’re that close) on a whim. They were on sale for $20 at Best Buy and I thought why not? Now 5 months later, I love my Alexa.

If you are on your own for long spells this little device would be company, not only a friendly voice but music as well. Fantastic.","I found setting it up maddening, as I'm not to good with computers, but the hassle was well worth it.

5.0,11 months ago,Argos,Great second unit for the bedroom,"We bought this for our son's birthday having already got one for the living room. As with its older brother, the dot is simple and easy to setup and use. Good sound quality but as you would expect from its size, not as good as the full size echo. Our son loves having it to listen to music etc. so to that end it was a great purchase, and no more expensive than going direct to Amazon for it."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Neat little dot,"I have a couple of the 2nd gen echo dots. The sound quality on these are much better than the 2nd gen. The dot itself is great. It integrated into my wink hub and I can control my entire smart home line of products with it. It also integrates into your calendar so it can tell you what is planned for the day. You can purchase items from amazon on it, order pizza, and even an uber. You also can set it up to work as an alarm clock as well. If you have multiple echos, they work as an intercom system in your house. Overall a great product."
5.0,a year ago,Argos,"Decent music service, sound and speaker options","I wasn't sure whether to get an Echo Dot or Plus, and I am very happy with the sound quality from a small device. Setup was easy! And for a bigger sound we turn on a decent Bluetooth dock that we have and within seconds the Dot is using that instead. For even better sounds, we turn on our living room Hi-Fi’s Bluetooth - it just works. Also, you can get Amazon Music Unlimited for 3.99 p/m for one Echo making it great value over the usual services out there. Overall, very happy with the product."
5.0,10 months ago,Argos,Echo Dot,"Most people are aware of the Amazon echo products, but this was our first purchase. We bought this during a promotion period and very happy with the dot at that price point. To get the best out of the echo dot you require a subscription, which was fine as we have prime music. A solid built product, but getting to grips with the type of commands you need to get Alexa to perform tasks can be quite amusing."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Best Little Smart Speaker,"Works well turning lights on and off. Surprisingly awesome speaker for playing music. The sound is nice and full. Perfect for our upstairs. Significant upgrade from the last gen. Looks nicer, sounds better. Worth the price and upgrading."
4.0,a year ago,Argos,Nice improvement on the old model.,"The 3rd Gen Echo Dot is bigger and louder. It has better bass response and a higher maximum volume level. It also looks nicer in my opinion, though bear in mind it's a bit bigger which may be a factor if you're limited for space. The mains adaptor now uses a round connection instead of USB so older power supplies will not work with this model. If you find the sound quality of the old Echo Dot models to be lacking then this is a worthwhile upgrade. Feature wise there's not much difference."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Loud and Crisp,The Echo Dot 3rd Generation is slightly larger and heavier than the 2nd generation model. This Echo has a slightly bigger speaker as well inside it. The result is a crisp and loud voice. One thing I don't like is Alexa copying all my contacts to Amazon Cloud or the Device memory without asking permission for it during the setup process.
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,"Great product, if you don't mind Amazon spying","Picks up your voice really well, even with music or other things playing. It usually recognizes that it's not you when people say ""Alexa"" on TV and stuff. No need to buy the regular Echo or Plus because I have a seperate/way better speaker system. I hooked it up with some lights and climate control and it's seamless."
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,This product keeps getting better and better,"This product keeps getting better and better. Way better sound than the original. Also better quality, if it falls it feels stronger and sturdier. Now if only the music that you request was part of purchase, instead of having to pay extra. It will be amazing. Most songs I request are not part of the deal. It asked me to pay extra."
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Works perfect for my needs,"A nice little gadget to make life easier. Use this as an alarm clock to wake me up in the morning, get the news and weather while eating breakfast. Use as a timer while cooking, play jeopardy and escape games with family at dinner time and listen to music while resting. Also can control lights around the house. Fun little gadget."
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,A great addition to the household!,"This is the second Echo Dot I’ve bought and so far, I really enjoy having them around. The setup is easy and I’m still uncovering all sorts of fun things you can do with them. I have one in almost every room in my house and get a bunch of use out of Alexa. I got mine when they were on sale, which seems to happen fairly often, so it might be worth it to wait for that but I would recommend this product to at least try it out if nothing else."
5.0,4 weeks ago,Best Buy,Everything I Expected,"This is our third Echo...one full size and two Dots. Was very easy to set up. Sound is a lot better than our older Dot. It is good but not great. More mid and high end acoustics would knock it out of the park. A built in wall mount would be helpful. We bought an after-market wall mount. Overall, the Dot 3rd Gen is well worth the price."
4.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Like it and it works well for us!,We bought our Dot in a package deal with an Amazon FireTV stick so we got it for a good price. We use it mostly for setting timers and listening to Pandora. We have been unable to connect it to our Bluetooth Bose speaker but the Dot speaker sounds almost as good. We are not finished exploring what we can do with it and will likely get more smart home devices in the coming months.
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Building a stereo household,"I bought this Echo Dot to enhance the coverage and quality of the Amazon Alexa system in my apartment. With the Amazon Echo (2nd generation) in the front living area, the Echo Dot seemed to be that perfect paired addition to make a seamless system. The pairing was simple, and if you haven't expanded your house coverage with a Dot, or perhaps another Echo, you'll be very pleased with the result."
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,"Alexa, thank you!","I mostly use the echo dot for an alarm, to ask her the time and weather, and to play music. We also have a plug/outlet that’s controlled by it, which is nice. We use that to operate a light that’s in a corner behind the couch that’s hard to reach. “Alexa, turn on the corner light.” I know there are other functions I’m not using but I’m very happy with the ones I am. Good sound quality."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,It's like having your own assistant,"I got this for Christmas more as a speaker for music. But there are things that I asked of Alexa that I didn't think she could actually do. Without reading a huge book of what you can do with it, you can just try asking her to do things and mostly she can. You can have her call people, set a timer for that pizza in the oven, even play music, but turn off after a period of time. I'm still learning the capabilities of three echo Dot. As for sound quality (cause I know that's what everyone wants to know) I will say it's pretty good, but at the same time, I have nothing to compare it to."
5.0,a year ago,Target,So far very good with my new Echo Dot devices,"My Echo Dots arrived about a week ago. They were very easy to set up. I have not yet been able to connect an additional speaker to either of them. I love the fact that I can say ""Alexa"" and the device will try to do whatever I ask. I'm still trying new things, but I have asked for different music selections, asked for a timer, news, weather, change in volume, pause, and stop whatever I'm hearing. I want to try to connect to the speaker and use it in a close by location. I will add an appointment reminder. I'm sure there's much more to do."
5.0,a month ago,Currys,Matt's review of Amazon Echo Dot 3rd Generation with Clock - Sandstone,"Pros: I have larger echo's downstairs for listening to music and radio etc so I purchased this specifically for the bedroom to use as an alarm, bedside radio and because of the display a bedside clock. The larger echo's downstairs have a better sound because they have larger speakers but the echo dot with Clock is perfect for the bedroom. Cons: Nothing."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,I used to laugh...,"... at people who used Alexa. I guess it's because I never had. Of all the consumer-marketed speech recognition I've used recently, she is simply the best. I really want to embrace the Samsung world since I have so much of their stuff, but Bixby just doesn't doesn't know me like Alexa does. Even without Amazon music unlimited, Alexa can usually find some music that doesn't induce nausea (now if my wife could only learn that skill...). I could go on and on, but I can't possibly convince you of how cool this is. Just spend the 40 or 50 bucks and see for yourself."
4.0,a month ago,Argos,Great starter echo,"Great starter Alexa product, speaker is OK for playing music in our downstairs if u decide to use it for that. We have it connected to our other devices such as lights, heating and a plug(which activates our kettle) we also can have conversations in other rooms which we have other echo devices which is handy when feeding our son his milk an need to ask for something or adjust the lights or heating."
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Qutie useful little dot,"We were a bit against these things at home. It's all about privacy. But after all are we living in a private world any more ?. So we gave it a go and purchased two of these. One for the downstairs kitchen and one for the upstairs bedroom. They are really good fun. Playing music, acting as intercom, sounding alarms, working as a timer in the kitchen, playing news and weather, answering questions to name just a few. Really good small speaker with decent sound quality. Does the job."
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,A must have for every room,These so handy to have. They allow me to keep in touch with my grandma and set up reminders to take her medicine.

The app also has many great things to offer such as night lights for my kids and testing them on math facts!

I love the sleek design, small and compact, sits nicely on my sky box.

The main bug that irritates me is that when trying to play multi room Spotify the speakers will occasionally either stop playing randomly then start again, or they will randomly start sounding screechy or echoey. Just today I asked Alexa on one of these speakers, ""turn off my alarm"" Alexa responds with, ""you have no alarms"" as the alarm is going off! Stupid! Fix these bugs and it would be a great product as it stands the software is horrible!"

She can give fun facts, tell you the weather, call friends /family, she even crack a joke. The list of her capabilities are endless. I love this so much I bought a second device. I placed my first one in the kitching and the second in my office, I have paired them and can use the multi room function. Can’t wait to keep finding all the amazing functions Alexa can do. The best thing is she is always learning."
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Smaller than I expected but the sound is great!,"This is such a great product, the sounds is great! Answers all sorts of useful and completely pointless questions (Just for fun). Knows how to play lots of different games which are fun on your own or with a group. I have one for the kitchen and one for the lounge. Thinking now about getting the bigger one which has a subwoofer as these don't have much bass. Great for most music but if you need the bass, buy the bigger one. Great fun, super useful, kids love it, I love it!"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great sound,"Once the item came in the house, my 12 years old daughter took this over. She has it in her room and plays music before going to bed. In the mornings she takes it to her bathroom and plays her music while showering and getting ready. It is loud and plays great. I just admit I am a bit jealous and now want one for myself. Great price and excellent quality."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Love it! But I’m nervous...,"So, this was a freebie with another purchase. Still getting to know Alexa, but the product seems awesome. I find it’s quite convenient. The speaker sound is great. From its perch in my kitchen, it seems to pickup commands from anywhere on my ground floor, unless there’s too much noise..like tv or multiple people chatting. However, I have been nervous about having Jeff Bezos listening to going’s on in my house. I’ve tried to set it up with some “precautions” to limit surveillance...and accidental purchases and messages to my boss..."
5.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Everything I hoped it would be!,"I have an Echo and wanted to be able to access Alexa from other parts of our home. I added three Dot's so I have one on each of three floors and in my work shop. They work great! I've added smart lights in our family room and outside to light up our driveway at night. Sometimes my commands aren't interpreted correctly, but I'm learning to speak more clearly with some words, and that has made a difference."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great add-on to full size Echo,"We have owned the full size Echo for several years. The Echo Dot has all the same features, but not the sound quality if playing music. It is an excellent way to add a ""satellite"" to Alexa in other locations around the house. I am considering getting a second Echo Dot to add to the basement area."
5.0,a year ago,Currys,Sarah's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 3rd Gen 2018 Charcoal,Pros: Sound quality is very good. No static/fuzzing when volume is at its highest Cons: Playin 2 different songs at same time on 2 echos from prime...not happening! I was told this was possible but I've tried everything. Ud need a family prime account for this. U can play prime on one n radio on other or listen to same songs on both.
5.0,a month ago,Argos,"Echo works well, and a real AR assistant","I have really enjoyed shopping with Argos, the ordering process, being kept up to date with everything, to receiving the goods was effortless. I ordered three of Amazon's echo units, great family Christmas presents. Each family member has thoroughly enjoyed their little AR assistant. As a family, we enjoyed setting it up together and we even call other off the echos"
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Free is Always Good,"This was a bonus to the Fire TV I purchased. I have the tower, so now I have 2 of these things in my home. Whenever a commercial comes on talking about Alex, they would wake up - so I changed the names. I am 65 years old so not really used to this technology. I found that it does replace me tuning to a radio station when I want to listen to music. It's not something I would go out and purchase myself."
4.0,a year ago,Argos,Great introduction to smart speaker,"Ordered online and though it was out of stock over Christmas it came in early, happy child.. Great introductory smart speaker or for a child or for a small bedroom as part of a group of amazon speakers in your house. Not exactly room filling sound but good for its size. Voice control is very good and Alexa mostly understands everything we ask her. Music wise these work best if you have a music subscription like Spotify. Otheise she will only play what’s saved on your phone."
4.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Amazon - Echo Dot (3rd Gen) - Smart Speaker with A,"I primarily use this as a bluetooth speaker for music with the occasional command to see what the weather will be today. Alexa is very responsive, and the quality of the sound is surprisingly good. Plus I think the design is pretty sleek. I received this as a free gift when purchasing my Ring doorbell."
5.0,a year ago,Currys,Tony's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 3rd Gen 2018 Charcoal,"Pros: Voice recognition is better than 2nd generation. Speaker seems louder than 2nd generation model as well. And there's the 3.5mm jack at the back if you wish to connect an external wired speaker if you wish. Lastly - it's a lot easier to set up than the 2nd generation model using the Alexa app. I use it with Amazon music and for internet radio, as well as setting alarms. Cons: No bad points."
5.0,a month ago,Currys,Eleanor's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 3rd Gen 2018 Charcoal,Pros: Understands voice well over other noise going on. Good shopping list function. Convenient size. Brilliant that it functions on its own ie doesn't have to be connected to a larger echo device. Cons: Shopping list doesn't always sync to both phones with the app.
4.0,a month ago,Argos,Good for the basics,Bought it so we could voice control our Sonos speaker and it is good for this. Note it definitely prefers amazon prime music to Spotify but not too hard to force it to use Spotify. Could be easier to connect to products but not too tricky once you get the hang. Turns our tv on and off but can’t do anything more on there it seems (can’t control the volume etc)
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Great product easy to set up,"We initially resisted getting “an Alexa” . However now that we have the Amazon Echo Dot it is very useful, educational and huge fun. We have it linked with our Sonos system as well. We thought it would be difficult to integrate the router, Echo Dot and Sonos, but the instructions made it quite straightforward. Great product delivered on time"
5.0,10 months ago,Argos,Alexa turn my heating on.,"This model is a great improvement on previous models which greatly enhances the appearance and also the sound. I can ask it to wake me with music, what is the length of the river Nile, the names of Henry the eighth’s children, play music etc etc. I also have “hive” with my heating so I linked them together ( very easy to do) and now can ask it to turn my heating on for an hour or whatever I want. Very novel but also very useful.,"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Incredible Sound Quality,"Amazon Echos now support multi-room audio, thus I’ve been filling my home with echos to achieve whole home audio without having to wire speakers throughout the ceilings. The Echo Dot 3rd generation blows the socks off the 2nd generation as far as sound quality. Once I connected it to my Everywhere group, it pumped out bass notes and audio so real that I thought this can’t be coming from such a small Dot. Compared with the 2nd generation that now sounds like an old AM radio, this 3rd generation really sounds incredible."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,"Small package, big sound!","I haven’t listened to the earlier echo dot speakers so I have nothing to compare it to, but I’m impressed by the quality and volume of the sound. Decent bass too for a small speaker. Good looking and the led lights around the edge are cool. Quick to set up and you’re not forced in to paying for Amazon subscription, there are plenty of free radio stations etc. Overall 10/10"
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Continues Not To Disappoint!,"We've had an Echo Dot for a couple of years now in our kitchen area. I wanted one for the master bedroom and couldn't have asked for a better price. Aside from cooking help, we use Alexa to give us updates on weather, sporting event scores, music, jokes, daily news, reminders, tell time, set timers, etc. I'm sure we haven't even used the Dot to its greatest potential; we're still on a learning curve!"
4.0,a month ago,bestbuy.ca,Big little item,"Works great. Setup was easy. There are a few little quirks, but this does not take away the great functionality of this clock speaker. Highly recommendable. The downside is that for certain things (like contacts) Amazon wants to upload them to their cloud, which I find unacceptable, therefore I can not use that functionality."
2.0,9 months ago,Argos,Alexa says no!,"Bought the Amazon Echo Dot but could not get it to connect to the internet. Tried to download the App on my Kindle Fire, Computer, Laptop and Mobile Phone but it would not connect to the internet on any of them. As this was the first time I had tried this device, I thought maybe I was doing something wrong, so asked my daughter, who has the device herself, and it still would not connect. Finally gave up returned for a refund."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great value since they're usually on sale/bundled,"These are much-improved over the previous generations: The sound is much better and they're not all plastic like the first generation. This also retains the aux out so you can plug this directly into a better-sounding/larger speaker. Still, this is great on its own for simple things and casual music listening."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Echo.... DOT DOT DOT!!!,"I love you my Echo Dot. You have become the best thing in my life. You have helped me organize everything. Play music I love and play games. I highly recommend this product to anyone that is new to the smart hub game.. And from all the AI's out there, Alexa by far takes the cake. Her jokes are hilarious too!"

5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Much better sound than old Dot,"The 3rd generation Dot actually sound good. You can actually enjoy music with it. I love my Echos. I have 5 various echos scattered around the house and I really enjoy playing music ""everywhere"". I can go from room to room with all the echos synced. It now sounds much better with the 3rd gen Echo."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Love it, don't believe that I didn't own it before","I am a fact and information ""based"" person. Then afterwards, I like my musical distractions. This Dot with Alexa was perfect! Giving me news, weather, Pandora music, Amazon Prime music, live TV news broadcasts, recite my upcoming calendar, resolve a quick math problem ... I could go on and on! The speaker quality is excellent. I don't believe that I didn't own one before having first interaction only 45-days ago. Everyone can find value/purpose in owning one!"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Same as the Old Dot, But Better Looking","I use the Echo Dots for Wemo and Ring product remote activation: ""Alexa, turn off the Man Cave Lights"" or ""Alexa, arm the Ring Security System""... most often I use it to turn off the bedroom lights at night without having to get out of bed. Speaker is average, if you're looking for quality audio step up to the full size Echo or get a better standalone unit dedicated for that purpose. Functionality is great, especially for getting your morning news in a 5-minute chunk via the ""Flash Briefing"" function. Love the product, especially at the $20/25 price point when it's on sale. I'm at 4 units, plus the Kid version for my 7-year old... and I'll probably end up with a few more."
4.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Love!,"We have Echo throughout our house for a couple years now and some google, but we love echo. We ended up buying this one for our daughter since she was the only one who didn’t have one in her room (she had google). Our boys love it since we have amazon music and amazon prime. Plus all the other amazon products we own are all connected. The only thing we don’t like is google can answer more questions than the echo’s can."
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Perfect for a first smart speaker,I bought this for my son. It is his first smart speaker. He loves it and uses it for many different things. The speaker has great sound quality he listens to music along with podcasts. He also uses it as an alarm and reminder for many different things form waking up to cooking to getting his laundry.
5.0,3 months ago,ao.com,I bought one of these at first to try it out in my Lounge as I have a busy large family. I wanted something that we all could use on a daily basis for simple family tasks and household reminders. This has been brilliant so much so I went and bought a further 3 for the bedrooms to link the whole house. AO delivered them all quickly and I was kept up to date with delivery the whole way. Overall brilliant service as always.,I bought one of these at first to try it out in my Lounge as I have a busy large family.

4.0,a year ago,Argos,Technically impressive,"Bought as presents for my kids when on sale which made them good value, I wouldn’t be happy to pay the full price. Works well enough with good sound quality for a small speaker. You do need to learn to speak to her in the right way but the technology is impressive. I suspect once the novelty wears off they will be gathering dust hence 4 stars. Tempted to get one to use as a radio and Spotify feed to my amplifier though. As it features a 3.5mm external speaker output."
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,"Easy set up, works as expected","Quick and easy set up even for the average/not super tech savvy person. Works as expected and easy to add skills. I mostly use it for music and the sound quality is just fine in my open kitchen/ living room. The one thing I wish is that this would work without being plugged in but then, how would they make as much money if you didn't have to buy one for every room you wanted it in."
4.0,a month ago,Argos,Dot great for 10 yr old to use in room,"Looks good, plug is massive for some reason. Wanted child to be able to access music independently without needing a phone or iPad. This is great as they can just use Alexa to get music. Using on Spotify. Prob need to look into a family account so we don’t all have to listen to the same thing on our other speakers!"
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great product and value,"The smart speaker is amazing. Easy to install and Alexa replies to your commands all the time. Siri would sometimes struggle but Alexa is so much superior. Only issue I had was that the sound on music was a little too much bass for me and not enough treble. A lot of MIDs and can’t adjust the EQ Other than that, I would given it 5 stars. Thanks"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Awesome little Echo Dot,"To be clear: I love Alexa, and love having control over the various lights inside and outside of my house. I have an Alexa Show and 2 other Echo dots, in addition to this new Echo Dot. I haven't really noticed any difference in performance, or how well Alexa listens with this new Echo Dot. It does however look quite a bit better, so I think that's worth something. Still, not really much of an upgrade from the previous generation in my opinion. Works great though for what I needed it to."
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Bought Two on Prime Day,"There was a sale online where you could buy two for only $10.8 total. Customer service was very patient and helpful in crediting back the $40 since the cart wouldn't reflect the sale. The echo dot is very minimalistic and looks great! However I'd say the sound quality is not as crisp as the Google home mini. Still, for the price I paid, this product was worth it!"
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,love Alexia,"I have one in every room of my home. They are great for basic questions, playing music, shopping list, playing games, announcements throughout your home, Dropping into other rooms to have a conversation, and so much more...Great thing they are adding new stuff for her to do weekly. Hooking these up from out of the box is also surprisingly extremely easy! And the app is so useful, and also easy to use and navigate through!"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great sound quality,I am amazed at the sound quality of these little dots. The price just can't be beat. Having Alexa to assist in so many things is very convenient from turning on and off lights and music to giving me weather and news updates. I bought 3 so I could hear my music or news or a book on tape throughout the house. Very satisfied with this purchase.

5.0,4 months ago,John Lewis,My new friend!,My new Alexa is my new friend! Sounds a bit sad I know and I do have plenty of real friends but her lovely smooth and soothing voice does brighten my day. I keep her on my kitchen worktop and play music for my mood while I cook or clean up. I also use her to time my things cooking which is really useful. Then when I wish her goodnight at the end of the day she replies with “ Goodnight. sleep tight”.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Works well and is very easy to set up and use,"I really like the Amazon Echo Dot. It was very easy to set up and is easy to use. I haven't used it much yet expect for playing music, but it always finds me good selections when I ask for a certain kind of music. I really like when you ask it to do something, you don't have to scream in it, it picks up a soft voice command. I know it can do much more than what I've had a chance to use it for."
5.0,a year ago,Office Depot,Echo Dot 3rd Gen for music,"Bought two Echo Dots to go with the Echo we already had. We now have the Echo in our Great Room, a Dot in an Office, and another Dot in the Master Bedroom. With Alexa Groups we can have music throughout the house. Using the Drop In feature we have an intercom and the Announce feature lets us call out to everyone in the family. The Dot in the bedroom is now an alarm clock. We can use one as a speaker phone, and we're still discovering things we can do with them. Great value, easy to set up and great quality of sound for us."
5.0,a month ago,Currys,Robert's review of Amazon Echo Dot 3rd Generation with Clock - Sandstone,"Pros: I can’t say a lot really, it’s an echo dot that works very well on its own or alongside other Alexa amazon devices.The sound when playing music is equal to or better than most free standing radio’s.I do have mine linked to a B&O Bluetooth speaker which creates superb sound.If your thinking about this or the one without the clock display I would definitely recommend giving it a try. Don’t forget you do need the internet for it to function. Cons: None as to yet..."
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Great addition to my gen 1 Echo,"Received this for free as a Labor Day sale promotion for purchasing a new Fire TV. Set up is easy and functions as well as my gen 1 Echo - - I placed this in my kitchen to be used for listening to music and also as a timer or for any other need that arises - - Sound is obviously not as good as the full size Echo, but it still sounds good enough to enjoy music through. Plays well with other connected devices in my house, ie: Philips Hue, Sony smart TV.... etc."
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Game changer,Bought 3 of these for 3 teens. I don’t like the children having phones in their bedrooms and we all forget to set alarms in the morning and have to wake them myself. I can now set an alarm Schedule.Gaining extra sleep. Genius! When dinners ready we can notify them rather than shouting up the stairs and wasting those vocal cords. Kids use it as a novelty to and always ask silly questions which has us in fits of laughter.They love playing their music on it to. Good quality. Perfect for our need
5.0,3 months ago,Argos,Great item although Apple Music connectivity issue,I purchased this for my brother as a birthday present. Item was well packaged and quickly received. Item is great and he really loves it but we had initial problems connecting it to his Apple Music account which was strange because I had no issues connecting mine to Spotify. We did a quick google search and realised that this issue is quite common and managed to rectify the issue.
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Much better sound quality than other gen,"Great item and a useful tool for anyones house. Love being able to set multiple timers at once, get answers to most questions, and have a news feed played for me each morning. Highly recommend these. The sound quality of the Gen 3 is great, and much better than the other versions."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Decent Product,"1. Good audio quality 2. Connects easily via bluetooth to external speakers. 3. I use it for the following: a. Flash news briefing from WSJ (Whats News), WSJ Tech Briefing, Reuters, Denver CBS 4, Local weather, 5. Can make phone calls, but Google Mini better for this IMHO. 6. Reads Kindle books, and Audible Books. 7. Provides timers and wake up alarms. 8. Plays ""Sleep Sounds"" Rain and others. Cons: Google mini seems to be better at phone calls."
4.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Nice companion to a Show device.,Used this for a bedroom location where I didn't want a camera but did like the voice interaction;). My Show 5 is the main go to but I typically 'see' the notification of messages on the Dots colored ring. Definitely purchase a wall outlet holder that conveniently attaches to an electrical outlet. One less thing on the counter tops.
5.0,a month ago,Currys,Kelly's review of Amazon Echo Dot 3rd Generation with Clock - Sandstone,Pros: Great sound. Thousand times better sound quality than my first generation dot. Looks great too. The clock is an added bonus. My 3 children have one in each of their bedrooms and they love sending announcements to each other!
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Finally a good echo dot!!!!,Im extremely happy that Amazon did a complete redesign of the Echo dot because it was badly in need of one. The 3rd generation is finally way louder and the build quality is much better as well. I was debating on whether or not to get the Google Home mini because I've heard good things about it but I went with the echos just to give them another try. Im so happy with my decision because these things look so much better and sound so much better and also being able to set 2 of them up as a stereo pair is a plus too because I like it when my music is at the same volume throughout the house since I put them in separate rooms and them setup the stereo pair.
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Does the job,"Bought the amazon echo out of curiousity after being disappointed with the first gen edition. I have been very impressed however. I have not finished delving into all the features etc but the ones for which I do use the product are absolutely spot on. Commands are clearly understood, actions are relatively quick and the sound quality of the device is an improvement on previous models"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Excellent Addition,"With this Dot, I now have a Dot or Echo in every room, and the new Dots are great speakers for a small room. I can set my app for play everywhere and all of the speakers play the same station through the house. I can do housework, or just move from room to room without missing anything. Bonus of having an alarm and timer in each room as well!"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Works GREAT !! Simple plug/play installation,I bought a bunch of electronics from Best Buy - As a result this was a thank you gift from Best Buy. I thought that was pretty good of them. I gave it as a gift to my son who has Google WiFi. He said it was simple plug & Play; and it worked great. This was the version 3 model. As I understand versions 1 & 2 had problems understanding voice questions that resulted in bad to no answers. THIS unit did NOT have that issue. And it connected to the Google Wifi as easily as the same compatible Google mini would have.
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,We love our echo dots,"This came as a free add-on buying a Ring doorbell. We own 5 echo products (2 homes) and love them. This one went to our workshop where my husband spends plenty of time. He uses it for music and we both use it for drop-Ins, which is like an intercom. Sometimes Alexa is smarter than Siri, and vice-versa. These products would blow my parents’ minds!"
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Great sound! Alexa works,"This little thing sounds awesome!! I bought it for about half of the original selling price and it was a steal! Alexa work, but it could get better. I have a few of this in my living room and set them up in different places to get as best audio as possible. Would recommend, but probably not for more than $40."
4.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Works better than last model did,"Having the 1st gen, this one is better. Still has its issues though. It more often than not, fails to provide me with any substantial answers to any questions I ask. It also fails mostly to set my Ring alarm, though disarm works fine...idk how to properly work this thing. Googles version has a much better information system to pull more imo."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Echo Dot and Alexa help!,"Echo Dot is my way to get to Alexa. Alexa is my go-to when I want to know what the temperature is outside or what the day’s weather will bring. In combination with another device, we use Echo Dot and Alexa to shut off a lamp and turn on a nightlight. Echo Dot and Alexa tell us when an Amazon package has been delivered at the mailbox. We enjoy the convenience and you will, too."
4.0,a year ago,Target,A Cool Item !!!,A friend has the ECHO DOT 3 ... I was so impressed with the sound quality that I purchased myself one from TARGET ... Only have had it for a week and only using it to listen to AMAZON MUSIC from my iPhone... Set up was fairly easy through prompting from ALEXA herself !!! Four stars because ALEXA has been non responding a dozen times already... I searched remedies online and it basically has to be reset when this happens... I still don't have a clue as to why this is happening ... Very frustrating ... SHE has been doing well the past few days though !!! Still a great item ... I even purchased a couple more for gifts !!!
4.0,3 weeks ago,Argos,Lives up to expectations,"It looks good in my bedroom, not too bulky / large but big enough for sound. Easy to ‘set-up’ and use, very handy for playing music, asking information and setting alarms / dates. Good / high end sound quality for the price, I’ll be looking to get more for my kitchen and living room! Would recommend to family and friends."
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Echo dot very useful,"This is one of two echo dots we have in our home. We use this for shopping list, music, turning on lamps, giving weather reports, anything you need. We moved to a new home and didn't have a place for a stereo system, so this helps with music throughout our house. We also have the Echo plus. I highly recommend the Amazon smart home accessories!"
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Great product,"Much improved over the 2nd gen. Great small footprint. However, I would opt for the regular size Echo over this. The regular sized one picks up my voice without yelling and the speaker is much better than on this echo dot. Still a great product if you are looking for a more affordable or smaller echo device."
4.0,a month ago,Argos,Great addition to daughters bedroom,Fantastic addition to our normal dot that we already have in our kitchen. This one is in our daughters bedroom and she is enjoying having access to the music but also the clock on the front is helping her with getting up and ready at the right time. We are hoping to teach her to set herself alarms for getting up for school. Great product
5.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Super easy to use and useful.,"We are not a tech family so we are getting a lot of use out of this product. Its so easy to use. We have had no problems in using it. Super useful. To speak to a item handsfree is wonderful. We are busy. Speaks clearly. Easily understands commands. Small and simple. I find myself learning more since its so simple. I dont have to stop what im doing, just speak and im answered."

Kids asked for a 20 minute reminder when they were baking. Not often she cant do what shes asked. Cons: Only thing that would improve it is if it could be charged up so you could move it around. We dont have alot of sockets in our house."
5.0,8 months ago,ebay.com,Good little toy,I think overall that Amazon produce the leading the smart speaker. The commands you can use are extensive and constantly being expanded on. The price is good. The subscription music service has the most songs. ITTT and other integrations work well. And the sound is really very good for such a small device.
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Amazon Echo Dot Review,We purchased the Amazon Echo Dot on Black Friday and have been very pleased with the sound quality. We wanted the Sandstone color option due to the fact that it will be placed in our child's nursery. The Alexa voice control works very well and we have been more than pleased with the sound quality. Great speaker for the price!
4.0,a month ago,Argos,Great present- does what it says,"Had a great time asking it questions, able to link it to Spotify and radio stations and easy to use. To begin using beef to follow instructions carefully, pretty self explanatory. Sounds quality not the best, perfect for pottering around the house but if you're going to have a bit party would recommend you use alternate sound system."
5.0,a year ago,Target,Echo Dot is a great product,"I already own two and love them, so this was bought as a gift. The recipient loves it too. I use the Echo Dot for so many things: alarms/timers, weather forecast, music streaming, reciting recipes, using Google, pairing it with smart plugs to turn on lights, etc. It's compact and unobtrusive, and has a very good range. It will hear you from clear across the room, and you can also access it through your smartphone when you're not home. I haven't had any issues with these devices."
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,The perfect gift!,Its nice and compact. Its has great sound and loud volume with no distortion! Responds great to your voice even from a distant room. There is one thing I dislike and thats the fact that its not battery operated which means you have to have it plugged into the wall every time you use it. If it wasnt for that it wouldve got 5 star rating!

5.0,3 weeks ago,Best Buy,Awesome Sound,Companies update their products almost every year with minimal difference. Amazon gave the 3rd gen echo dot a huge upgrade. This generation is so much louder with clear bass. Sound does not distort when at full volume. The new dot also responds and processes requests quicker. Great Product
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Amazing!,"I got this during the Black Friday Sale, so I got it half price which is amazing! It works so well and was so much easier to set up than I thought. I use it everyday now, a lot more than I expected myself! Matches the aesthetic of my room (black model). The audio is extremely good! Very loud for such a tiny speaker! I would 100% recommend this, there’s something so nice getting home, lying back, and just saying “Alexa, play happy vibes” and just chilling out. Great Product!!!!"

4.0,3 weeks ago,Best Buy,Pretty Good,"Bought it because my friend had one and I was impressed that she simply said the command to play NPR. I wanted to do the same with local TV & radio stations and SiriusXM stations. I haven't fully set up and have not yet examined all the possibilities and features, but it has met my initial reason for buying it: to easily get something played on the speaker without lifting a finger."
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Fun tech for everyone,"The Amazon - Echo Dot can be fun for the whole family. We mostly user it for the music service, playing whatever song we can think of. However, there are many more uses to be explored. We've ordered pizza, checked out traffic in our area, played games, and connected our cars. I highly recommend this product and look forward to what Amazon comes out with next."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Totally Worth The Extra Money,"Listen, I have read the reviews on the Echo 3, and they don't do it justice. Spend the extra money on the 3rd gen, don't buy the 2nd gen any more. 3rd gen Echo is FAR more responsive, the speaker is at least 4 times better, and you can group 2 of them in left/right stereo, which is huge for good sound. This puts true multi-room audio within the working mans reach. Don't hesitate. 4 stars because you will not get ""Awesome"" sound without a larger speaker, but hey, can't beat this for the money."
4.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Great for beginners,This is great starter product to introduce you to the alexa series. I was easy to set up. I wish they had different colors but all I could find was the basic black. I really love this device. 4 stars was given due to me order another color and best buy not having the color I chose. Overall a great product.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Love this! Buy this now if you are even considerin,"Love the echo dot. You can play music or XM radio or IHeart or Amazon Music, etc. on one speaker OR by saying ""Alexa play XM 123 everywhere or play Thriller everywhere"" you can walk from room to room cleaning and listening, depending on how many speakers you have, if you have 5 speakers all 5 will play, I'm not sure of the limit of number of speakers. And I have not even scratched the surface of what it can do."
5.0,11 months ago,Argos,"Great but if kit, hours of fun plus music on tap","Never thought I would godown the Alexa route, but after house sitting where there was one to play with I just had to buy my own. The 3rd generation is even better than the previous model good stand alone sound for everyday use, but the option to a connect to good quality Bluetooth speaker for listening to your favourite music just by asking beats rummaging through cd’s lists of mp3’s any day."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Echo.... echo..... echo......,"We added this to our home this Christmas and love the convenience. While this is just a convenience & not absolutely necessary it is nice to have. it is great to use with Prime to play music. We also use it frequently for weather reports and we always use it for our shopping list. I have it linked to ""anylist"" on my phone so I always have the shopping list with me when I go to the store. You can also just use the Alexa App to do this also. It is easy to setup & takes up little space. We have ours on top of some tall furniture, so you don't even see it, but still does its job."
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,"Little body, big voice.",Surprisingly crisp sound for such a little speaker. Plays music in a living room sized spaced pretty well. Alexa is a little annoying though or maybe I’m not utilizing her correctly but whenever I tell her to play a song she usually plays the wrong song so I just opt for manual Bluetooth from my phone.
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Amazing Sound,"Purchased the Echo Dot because I wanted to be able to listen to internet radio in my kitchen and craft room, but didn't want to spend big bucks. Wow! I've been blown away by how great the sound is. These little things sound like much larger speakers. I can clearly hear the one in my craft room over the running sewing machine. Love them!"
5.0,9 months ago,Argos,Echo dot is fab,I bought the Echo dot as it was on offer and went back the next day and bought 2 more for the kids. My next step is to get some compatible light bulbs so I my disabled wife can control the room lights without getting up. Also an excellent feature is the shopping list. You can verbally add an item to the list as you notice you need it and them when you are out you can see the list within the app on your phone and once you've purchased it you can easily remove the item from your list.

4.0,2 months ago,lowes.com,Volume a bit muffled,I bought this to replace my older model that only has 1 microphone but the 4 mics on this don't help it much more. The TV sound would confuse the commands given to it occasionally on the old model and this one seems better. The sound out of it is quite a bit muffled compared to the old one. I would like a sound that is somewhere in between both.

The sound improvements compared to the original dot is night and day. I can actually hear this one while showering. We mount vertically to a wall so I had to purchase a third party mounting device which cost the same as the unit, but worth it. Still having difficulty playing media on all devices but that isn't required for our primary use."

5.0,a year ago,Argos,So nice I bought it twice,This product is honestly a fantastic life saver. I have one upstairs and one down. They're awesome for playing music that you have on amazon prime and I use the main one for radio and shopping lists. Ask alexa anything and she usually has an answer. Just make sure your the only one talking in the room when you give her sommands because she gets confused. Try not to have her to close to the TV as well as she'll here it. The games have kept us occupied too as well as the handy reminders!

It is pretty useful nonetheless when I’m feeling lazy, but otherwise it’s a cool tech item","With today’s modern technology, these do come in handy.

5.0,a month ago,Currys,Ayner's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 3rd Gen 2018 Charcoal,Pros: Everything about it is good for such a small piece of kit it has great sound and great features . Cons: Its just a pitty that amazon didnt give people that buy this product free music as the echo dot is a great gadget to have anywhere in the home or work place as this would give more people insentive to buy the product knowing they have access to lots of music.
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Great if you don't mind the privacy concerns,"We love being able to use voice to interact with the Alexa AI. Weather, games, and streaming that one song that gets stuck in your head on-demand has been a real joy. Our son loves playing rock-paper-scissors and lemonade stand. The audio quality is surprisingly good for a device this small."
5.0,8 months ago,very.co.uk,Great sound quality,"I had avoided buying anything inanimate that speaks to you however I decided to give this a go. Its brilliant and whilst I am certain I am not using it to its full capacity, the radio element is superb. Easy setup and frankly, it's been great value for money. I'll probably only ever use it for radio and the news but so far, love it."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Fun Device for the home,"I purchased two of these devices, one for my son and one for my mom. They have enjoyed having these and like to call each other on them often.

Love it!"
5.0,6 months ago,Argos,Exceeded my expectations.,"Amazing bit of tech. You do need a premium music account to listen to music (I chose Spotify premium.) For the size of the speaker the sound is good. I have connected the dot to my surround sound system, and it sounds awesome. Having a digital assistant is also great for the weather, news and can give you information about almost anything."
4.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Great little device,"We are owners of an echo show and a big echo and have liked the fact that you can set reminders, alarms, and specially communicate between Echo’s through the house.

5.0,2 weeks ago,Best Buy,Great technology,"Set up was easy. Compatible with many smart devices. Small enough to use anywhere around the house.

5.0,a month ago,influenster.com,So I got this for Christmas and I wasn’t quite sure how I would like it but honestly I LOVE IT.

As well, all the other wonderful Alexa features, and so many more come out monthly. Our family loves it."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Regular Echo Dot but with better sound,This came free with a Ring doorbell I bought. Was reluctant to get the freebie cause my friends/family either have one or don’t want one and I already had 3 Echo devices but got it anyway. It’s an improvement over the 2nd generation Dot because the sound quality is much better. Otherwise it’s basically just like my other 2 2nd Gen Echo Dots. This Echo Dot is probably the best way to get an affordable smart speaker if you don’t want to go all in and get the main $100 dollar one.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great little smart speaker,I was surprised by the quality of sound this little speaker provides. Perfect for the bathroom for getting ready in the morning checking weather news and listening to music/the radio.

5.0,5 months ago,Argos,It's magic,"A great addition to our home tech, we bought it after visiting friends who had one and they demonstrated it. The knowledge is brilliant, even helps with difficult crossword answers. Playing music is a doddle, such a choice, my wife's selection is so different to mine but alexa copes with it all. It's our Grandaughter's favourite bit of tech as well."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Does as advertised, smooth operation","The product does as advertised and was easy to setup. Speaking to and activating the device can be done using your normal tones and speech patterns, for adults. This is where the fun starts. My daughter yells at the device and it doesn't respond, and that's enjoyment for her brother and i. alarms can be set with the app or speaking (normally) directly to the device. Be careful what you say around the device, it will respond/react. I would recommend this to a friend, especially to torture others."
5.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Love all the echo products.,"With a mixture of Echo Dot, Show and Echo devices in different rooms we have the ability to verbally control smart home devices from anywhere in the house. The ability to listen music across all devices is also one of the main features we use. After that we like just asking Alexa ridiculous questions just to see what kind of response we get. Love and enjoy this product!"
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Huge Fan!,The Amazon Echo Dot is awesome. Not my first one by any means and I have several of them around the house but they are just awesome.

5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,basic Alexa for general use,the echo dot only has a difference in the specs that it has. It works just like any other Alexa device and has the same features too. The only bad part is that you have to use certain skills a certain amount of time to unlock new features. You can connect it to your tv and any other amazon devices that you own.
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Versatile smart speaker,"I purchased the Echo Dot with the sole objective of turning my old hifi into a smart-speaker via an Aux cable. This works above and beyond expectations. I no longer have to plug in my phone or laptop via Aux cable to listen to Spotify via my big speakers, I just ask Alexa to do it. I've even begun using additional features, such as asking Alexa to set an alarm, tell me a joke, or check the outside temperature before my morning walk. I've barely scratched the surface, but I'm already impressed."
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Cute and functional!,I bought this finally giving in to get a voice activated speaker in the house. It has been great to listen to tons of music to. The volume and bass are great. It is small and I love the fact that I can turn the speaker off when I don't want to use it. I can listen to the latest songs without having to physically change the station. Loving this!
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Echo Dots-best bang for your buck,"In my opinion the Amazon Echo Dots or any of these small smart devices are the best bang for the buck, and these 3rd gen units have better speakers and a bit more bass than the 2nd gen ones, the cloth covering is also a bit classier! Have about five Echo Dots thru my house and they make life easier with the recent mini explosion of smart home devices!"
5.0,8 months ago,Argos,Great little gadget,We have the full Echo in our kitchen and purchased the dot for our 8 Yr old daughter to use. Great for her to play music from amazon and even helps with her homework lol. Be sure to turn on parental controls though when letting little ones use it.

Thought I’d give the dot and echo a go... Wow!! The sound that they produce from such small devices, I am truley amazed. Safe to say I went back and bought more. 2 echo’s and 6 dots as bought a couple for presents.

As well as this I've set up a nice morning system, instead of me constantly nagging my son out of bed a procession of calendar to do's, weather alerts, recent news and pick me up songs now do that job for me."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Echo,Love it. So much fun to play around with the features Alexa gives. Can ask her most things and she has the answer. And the music quality is amazing also. Even volume 1/2 is decent for sitting around listening. I bought this for my friend and then my boyfriend bought me one. Great purchase.
4.0,a year ago,very.co.uk,Excellent product,Great product and easy to set up and use with my android smart phone. Alexa tells em the weather forecast... Plays music from amazon music by voice command and answers most questions in detail... Even better if it could call people without them having to install the amazon app and also if it could access YouTube songs instead of the subscription based amazon music. Regardless still a really useful product... Next steps to install smart plugs and bulbs...
5.0,a month ago,Currys,Dave's review of Amazon Echo Dot 3rd Generation with Clock - Sandstone,Pros: Very good sound and alexa understanding Cons: Only allows 2 adult accounts which have to be linked together. Amazon must think that people's children leave home when they are 16 because no further adult accounts can be added. This is a stupid and inconsiderate thing they have done with such a housing shortage that this country has at the moment.

I can set up alarms, ask tons of questions & get the answers I need immediately. The sound quality is very surprising for such a small speaker, plus you can request it to play tons of different songs. Of course the best part is the fantastic price offered by Best Buy for this item which is why I'd never shop anywhere else for any & all electronic item for myself or as gifts for others."

I would encourage anybody to give it a try."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Awesome device!,"I was a little sceptical at first, but the Echo Dot is so simple to use and versatile I can't believe it. We also purchased the smart plugs.

Absolutley great product!"

The music function is fun (Alexa, play Jack Johnson, or Alexa play Smooth Jazz or whatever) and ridiculously convenient. We also ask the weather, random questions, and play occasional games. Sound quality is very good for such a small unit! Love this."
3.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Cheap way to control lights,"I used this to turn room lights on and off, mostly. It's also a very good speaker with decent sound quality that rivals most bluetooth speakers. I don't really use it for normal queries, since most of the time Alexa doesn't know. Every once in awhile I'll ask the weather for the next few days."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,The Echo Dot opens a new world of fun . . .,"For Christmas gifts I originally purchased 2 Echo Dots. After trying it in our family room, I bought 6 more as gifts! There is an endless number of fun things you can due with the ""Alexa"" command! I enjoy tapping into the Amazon music library. The grandchildren do lots of games. After Christmas I also added on the Echo button for family games of up to 4 players. The sound of music is great- fills the room. FUN!"
5.0,a year ago,very.co.uk,Alexa,I had thought about getting 1 of these for the last 6 months finally took the plunge. Set up was quite tricky as the directions said i had to go to settings and turn off smart switch to enable it to connect it. However my phone didnt have smart switch. So spoke to a team member on libe chat .who was so unhelpful. Refered me to live chat to an echo expert. Again no help at all. Was begining to think I'd wasted my money. Decided to google my phone and smart switch. Where i found the answers on how to connect it. Once connected i havent looked back.
4.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Amazing sound for such a small dot,"Nice sound for a small footprint. Had some difficulty connecting to bt speakers at first, but finds paired items fast once installed. Wish it had a portable power supply (battery) but maybe in gen 4. Does not interfere with my Alexa enabled sound bar, can have different sounds in different rooms."
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Love the Echo,"This is my sixth, five in my house, and one in Indonesia. They all work great. Easy to communicate with in-laws in Asia when not wanting to use WhatsApp. It works well with other smart plugs and light bulbs, too. I have almost forgotten how to turn a light on manually. haha 3rd Gen has even better sound than the prior versions."
5.0,a year ago,Argos,"Looks a fab and stylish, quality product","Bought one each for kids christmas as wanted to connect them to the downstairs echo. These are great, easy to set up and are now all connected throughout the house. Good sound out of the speaker for such a small size. Can interact with the kids easily if I need to I can even drop in on them when I'm out the house and chat via the alexa app. Can play my spotify music through it and do a whole host of things. Looking to get the camera one for the kitchen next. Highly recommend"
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,So convenient!!,"I got it on a really good deal at Best Buy. It was very easy to set up and I have enjoyed and used it more than I really thought I would. The hands free operation is so very nice. I find myself asking Alexa more and more to play music, the time, make phone calls, etc. The sound quality is amazing. I was so impressed with it, I ordered a second one."
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Awesome upgrade to the regular Echo Dot!,"This replaces a regular Echo Dot and adds a clock! It’s a great addition to my studio. Best Buy’s delivery choice was interesting. It arrived at the local distribution center in St Louis but for some reason was then flown to TEXAS, only to be flown BACK to St Louis & eventually delivered to me. Very strange delivery routing."
5.0,8 months ago,Argos,Makes things that little bit easier,After visiting family members who were using echos around the house I decided to purchase one for myself. It has made getting things done round the house that bit simpler. I have set reminders and alerts at set times to remind me to do things I normally forget it links easily with my amazon music and Spotify accounts to play high quality audio and its even connected to my speaker system via Bluetooth to play music all over the house.
5.0,4 months ago,Argos,Love the design and the sounds is pretty good!,This is the third echo dot I have ordered from Argos. I have a echo in almost every room in the house. The dot is perfect in the bedrooms to use for lights or as alarm clock. Even the sound isn’t that bad. Much better then the old echo dot. Would really recommend this to everyone.
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Loads of fun in a small package,"Easy to set up and use. We have enjoyed having the capability of getting weather updates and forecasts simply by asking Alexa. Echo Dot integrates easily with iHeart, Tuned In and other streaming services. I can play my personal music stored on Amazon simply by asking Alexa to play it."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Good but coud be a bit better,"This Echo Dot 3rd Generation is great in all aspects except two, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars. One thing it lacks is the extra adapter to connect/pair it with other devices like an external speaker or car audio system (ie. aux etc). The second thing is that the AI (Alexa) sometimes does odd things, but I believe it is just a ""language"" thing to a degree. I suppose it is still ""learning"". :) Otherwise, its very nice. Has great sound quality and helps with Smart Home devices."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Makes Life Easy,"At the cost when this was on sale, I didn't mind finally jumping into the Echo Google culture. I initially got a free Google Mini, latest gen and then figured out my Xbox One X only supported Alexa and Cortana. So I went with Amazon. They just are light years ahead of the pack and not slowing down. So I have this connected to an old Samsung soundbar via Bluetooth, and also for control of a room. While Xbox support is still in progress, I can integrate Alexa into playing random songs, telling my Xbox what to do, etc."
5.0,6 days ago,Argos,Even better then the second gen!,"I started off with the 2nd gen Echo Dot, and was really pleased with how that performed. So looking to expand to other rooms I bought this version. Complete up grade, sound is amazing for its size, and even better mics to pick up your voice. Set up in about a min or less and looking at getting more."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Perfect for my teenage son.,"I bought this on offer and its definitely worth it. Great sound, right size for a bedroom and the connectivity is great. Only cons so far are that it took a while to set up as we have an echo and couldn't get both on the same wifi to start and that my son 'drops in' on me to ask for food and drinks to be taken upstairs! Going to get my 10 year old one."
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Still not sold on Echo devices.,"I am working on making my house a ""smart home"". I have 3 dots to see if it makes things easier to control. This is a learning curve as commands can be quirky and it takes a while to learn how to ""command"" certain items. I use my Dots to control thermostat, lights and music through Sonos speakers (this is where I only give 3 stars). Until recently I have been able to somewhat control my speakers to a limited capacity as there are commands/skills for each Sonos account ie. SiriusXM, Spotify, Pandora."
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Great help in the kitchen!,"Got this on Black Friday for my husband's Christmas. It was intended just as a Bluetooth speaker with voice commands so he could skip tracks and change volume without having to get off the treadmill. The sound quality is impressive for the size of speaker. It's also a very handy gadget in the kitchen for setting a timer or asking Alexa how many ounces 700 grams is, even when your hands are dirty. What I didn't expect was the amount of fun we had asking Alexa all kinds of silly questions."
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Echo Dot,I love it. I have it in my craft room. Echo keeps me company while I'm doing my crafts. I have lights hooked up and a couple of other outlets. Very cool. I have it read my books to me while I'm working or play music. Even make phone calls. Hands free. Shipping was fast. I used some points and got it for very reasonable.
5.0,5 months ago,saturn.de,Easy to use,"It's always great to play your favorite musics only by asking while you are cooking or doing household chores. It's really perfect to have short info about the traffic and the weather before leaving the apartment to go to work! And have someone who can always remind you, your to do list! Everything works well with Alexa!! It can be a great friend of you:)"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Entertaining,"Bought this for my mom as sort of a ‘companion’. It’s a bit limited in what it can do if you don’t have any smart-home things to control. But it’s fun and helpful for setting reminders and timers and answering basic questions. I think more of a gadget than really super useful. But it was very inexpensive, and I think worth it just for the fun factor and voice-activated music, weather updates and such. Sound quality is totally fine and it is very unassuming looking."
4.0,7 months ago,Argos,Easy to.set up. Quite good sound for small speaker,Really easy to.set up. It has quite good sound for so small device . Looks good to. Only one issue when you play loud music you gotta shout to it quite loud to wake it up but I guess its obvious. :) ans if you have any other wifi controlled devices it works really well.
5.0,2 months ago,ao.com,"The Amazon echo dot is the best present to buy anyone! It’s easy to use and can do everything you need.

5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Love the echo dot,I got this with my Ring doorbell. I love being able to set reminders for my son so that he leaves for the bus on time. I also really like that I can drop in and talk to my son when he is home and I am still at work. The sound quality is great. It is able to recognize both mine and my son's voice. I enjoy using it and plan to buy more products that I can connect to the echo with.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Amazing!,"I have owned several echo dots, and each generation is an improvement from the last. Generation 3 has a cloth outer wrapping which gives it a more modern look, and is a lot larger then the originals, but that is exactly what makes this version so much better. Due to the increased size, the speaker is larger and thusly allows the echo dot to fill a room with richer/fuller audio."
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Excellent Sound. Small Speaker,My first Alexa device. Small and compact enough for me to put in my kitchen. Loud sound. Clear Response from Alexa. What I found out is the higher you place it. The louder you have to yell at it so place it within height level. Would definitely get again.
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,It's like Star Trek ;-),"Like the TV series, you get a computer you can talk to, and The Next Generation looks a little more posh and ""homey"", and a little less nerdy, than before. The sound quality is much better than my 2nd generation Dot: more volume, and more bass. I really needed an external speaker before, even though I mostly use it for listening to podcasts, but this one does okay by itself."
5.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Makes life so much easier,"We already had a sonos speaker with Alexa in our dining room which we bought from JL and were very impresssd with. When these Amazon echo dots went on Black Friday sales we bought three more, two as Christmas presents for family and one for ourselves. Voice control does make your life easier, I find it particularly useful when I got greasy hands in kitchen I can still set timer / play music / play radio etc. without making a mess. Also while having a quick breakfast you can get your flash briefing and get all the news and weather forecast."
5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Alexa has replaced my judgmental family.,"It's almost like an APPLE product, once you have one, nothing will ever be the same again. Amazon may very well be the only place we ever shop anymore and having this echo dot enabled has made life tasks...EASY! Alexa is my new go-to for all things news, music, alarms, and lazy calling friends. Obviously, any new generations that come out are 9 out of 10 times better. Our first Echo Dot is a Gen 2 and this Gen 3 blows the old one out of the water with quality audio and Alexa can even hear you whisper from across the room."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Good little gadget,Very easy to set up. Very good sound quality. Sometimes it doesn't hear me say the wake word so have to repeat it! I also have a google nest mini which seems to know a lot more than Alexa. But it's learning all the time and is much faster than google at switching smart devices on and off. Still very happy with it!
5.0,10 months ago,Argos,"perfect bedroom alarm clock, radio and information","The perfect addition to any room, especially in our case the master bedroom. Having already purchased the echo for the kitchen, I found myself taking it upstairs whilst doing chores. Then I found the dot! It’s sleek, small, and has a surprisingly punchy sound for its size. Highly recommend."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Fab addition to the kitchen,Really happy with the echo dot was thinking of getting the bigger one but this is just as good for what I need. The sound is really good and loud Love playing the music you do need to have an amazon account to get the best out of this though. Worth the money and couldn’t recommend it enough. Quite fun to when you ask it funny questions lol
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Echo Dots with clock ideal Christmas presents,"Ideal Christmas presents for my four young grandchildren, aged 5 to 10 years. They are each delighted and, in their words, ""Best present ever"". I was dubious whilst placing the order for the young children, but Granny has to keep up with modern times !! Also, the service with Argos was super quick, ready for collection the next day."
5.0,a month ago,Currys,Matthew's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 3rd Gen 2018 Charcoal,"Pros: You can do almost anything one amazon echo dot, say your favourite song/s play games with people around the world set reminder save notes find almost any information you want to know it is something everyone should have. Also you can connect to bluetooth and play music or videos from you phone Cons: Cant think of any!"
3.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,I enjoy using it for music.,I enjoy listening to the music from it. But I am very disappointed the it does not come with any type of instruction manual. I do not know the correct terms to get the full use out of it that I desire. Would like better information given along with it to help me find out how to use it fully better. It also said I had free 90 days to listen to sirius and it did not last that long.
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Small Yet Powerful,The new updated echo dot is brilliant! The sound is amazing and is a huge step up from the original echo dot. I love how you can ask Alexa pretty much anything - I particularly like saying “good morning Alexa” and she tells you a fact about history on that day. Would definitely recommend this product! Easy to set up and works like a dream. Much bigger than the original dot and the fabric feel is a nice addition.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,First venture with Alexa and it's been great,"I got the Dot with the Hue Bridge and light bulbs for the dining room based on recommendations from some coworkers. I couldn't be happier. Able to control multiple light sources (dining room and bedroom), the Bose SoundTouch sound bar, music, info, etc. Highly recommend it to anyone who wants to try to start to make their home smarter."
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Keeps getting better each Generation,"I have a generation 1, 2 and now 3. Amazon keeps making the Echo Dot better with each generation. The audio is not great as the Echo, but it comes close. I use it as a alarm clock, a reminder to take my meds and other things, to turn on my smart devices and as an intercom to communicate with other Echos in and out the house."
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Who knew?,"I got an Echo Dot free with the purchase of a Ring Video Doorbell Pro. Since it was free, I honestly wasn't expecting much. However, once I set it up I was blown away! It works with my thermostat, my doorbell, my surveillance, and my front door lock... ""Alexa, lock the front door"". This is something I probably wouldn't have bought, but now I'm a believer!"
5.0,a year ago,Target,Good improvement over previous model,The original echo dot had a terrible speaker. I have a few of the second generation connected to external speakers so that they would be decent music players. This one does not need an external speaker to sound OK. It surprised me that they do not use a universal USB port to charge it anymore. It has its own charging cable that does not seem compatible with anything else. It looks good.
5.0,9 months ago,Argos,Great Birthday Presents,"Wow what can I say. Got this with an Amazon echo for my birthday and it works amazing got the dot upstairs sound quality is amazing for music lovers. makes an ideal radio alarm, set reminders appointments it’s like the computer from Star Trek especially when you buy WiFi plugs and bulbs and other smart devices and connect them. WELL RECOMMENDED"
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Adding Alexa,"Ordered online for a next day delivery. Arrived no problems, very easy to set up to. After downloading the free Alexa app and away you go. The sound is suburb from such a small unit. It’s even faster when asking it to play the radio than to turn on the dab radio. Very impressed by it. Great value."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great system!,"We received a free unit when buying the Ring doorbell and I personally enjoyed the Echo Dot more than doorbell! The dot is extremely easy to hook up, the abilities of the unit surpassed my expectations, so much so we bought a second for the upstairs. Both units can play the same thing (simultaneously) in different locations! The sound system is excellent. The dot provides you with news, weather, music and much more! I love it and highly recommend it!"
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Echo is Awesome!!!,I have the larger Amazon Alexa and wanted an accompaniment for it. It connects to WIFI quickly and easily. Sound is great as well as range. I have grandsons so Alexa probably hates “Baby Shark” requests every hour on the hour. Would recommend for someone who does not necessarily want to invest in the large one first.
5.0,6 months ago,ebay.com,We got 2 and love them!,My boys love there new gadgets and they love the fact they can just say Alexa ring nanny not sure my mum is enjoying it as much but hey ho. Its great for singing them lullabys at bedtime and reading them stories for them to listen to while playing in there rooms! And love that it can be set to have parent control and codes so they cant get onto anything they shouldnt! Would totally recommend!!
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Alexa- Start my car!,"So I have a whole house of Google Home/Nest/etc. While those are awesome, they don't do everything. Alexa has many skills that aren't available elsewhere. Coolest to me is being able to start my car with the voice command through MyChevrolet skill. It is... horribly cold here right now, so it is a nice convenience to be able to start my car with voice commands while getting ready for work. By the time I go out there, my car is nice, warm, and charged up. A first world convenience, but appreciated."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Freebie,"Disclaimer. This product was a freebie as part of another purchase. That said, I already own several google home and chromecast devices so this is a one-off Amazon device on my network. I'm pretty pleased with the device as a whole and it is similar enough to my other smart speakers that the adaptation wasn't difficult. It seems to perform all the basic functions just fine such as controlling lights, setting alarms, and playing music. It's a nice device overall."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,"Sleek, compact, electronic assistant! Lots of fun",Luv my Echo Dot! Simple installation; lighted communication ring lets you know the device heard you and is responding. Echo Dot can complete operational actions or owner can mute the microphone; adjust volume or turn of the device.
4.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Love my Echos,"This is my 4th Echo device I purchase. I live in a split level home so my favorite feature is the intercom feature. I have an Echo on the main floor, the upstairs, and in the basement. Anytime I need to get a hold of my kids or just ask them a question when I'm in my bedroom and they are in the basement...well no need to get out of my comfy bed and take myself down to the basement just to ask if they want pepperoni or sausage pizza!!"
4.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Great affordable smart speaker,I love it! Alexa will read me a story or tell Samuel l Jackson to tell me a joke! ( Download of Sam Jackson's voice skill req'd) Alexa can turn off my smart light bulbs or change the color to whichever color I feel like requesting! How cool is that? I bought several to give as Christmas gifts and I'm sure the recipients will love this device as much as I do!
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Handy information tool,"This is a great item for keeping you up to date with news tuning into radio stations without having to physically tune your radio in ,all you have to do is ask AlexaItvi easy to set up via the app on your cell phone and you have to have WiFi. I use it as a timer as a clock you just ask,I have a morning briefing on news and weather . The speaker is suitable for bedroom ,I would consider the larger echo for lounge."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Excellent,This is the second one of these we bought. So we have one in each of the kids rooms. What an outstanding little device. Works so well. Kids love it. Sound quality really surprised me. Would definitely recommend this. :) Easy to set up. :)
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Intro into Alexa,"I have many many Alexa enabled products. This was the first for my girl to get her feet wet into the smart home world. She loves it! The ease of use and setup, along with all the functions make it worth the price. Even without a lot of smart home devices, it's great for music, alarms, timers, which are what she uses it for. Now she wants bulbs for her bedroom. If someone is interested in Alexa products this is the way to go."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Love it!,"Don't let looks deceive you. This little speaker is dynamite. A definite improvement over the previous generation Echo Dot! I have these throughout the house to control different smart devices in each room. Alexa has many cool ""skills"" that you can add to make it more useful. I love that you can ""drop in"" to another room to check on the kids or ""announce"" on all of the devices that dinner is ready. Definitely recommend this device."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,new best friend,"Love it, easy set up, apps has so much to offer, you can match it up with light bulbs, appliances outlets just about anything. would highly recommend the Alexa to anyone, I purchased this one for my 97 year old dad, now he can have Alexa help with his phone calls, turn on the lights and micowave anytime he wants. She also can give him weather reports and new updates We love Alexa at our house"
4.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Better than the 2nd Gen.,Better sound than the older version. Design and looks quite better as well . There's not much appealing in terms of functionality of it as far as the amazon echo dot capability. One good thing about it is I got it on sale so no regrets. Just an addition to many dots that I already owned scattered inside my home .
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Fantastic it and great value,"I purchased an Echo Dot back in the summer and fell in live with it. Since then, I have purchased four more of them as Christmas gifts. Best Buy had a great offer that allowed me to purchase a smart bulb and plug for just 5.00 each with the purchase of an Echo Dot. I couldn’t pass that deal up. These things are great."
4.0,a month ago,influenster.com,I loved my echo so much I bought a second for my bedroom and a few as Christmas gifts for friends and family.

4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Echo Dot (3rd Gen),"Solid product! Much better build than previous generations. It is larger and heavier than past. Plugs directly into an outlet with a USB connector. One thing not as good in the design is the audio has too much bass and can be muffled at times. Other than that one con, the gen 3 is much improved overall."
1.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"pain to setup, low sound quality, always ON mic","Novelty factor wears off quickly. sketchy service with always On mic. not easy to setup. if you have an iPhone or iPad, save up your money and get a HomePod (and Apple Music).

5.0,a year ago,Currys,Elaine's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 2018 Heather Grey,"Pros: Bought this for my aspergers son to set reminders rather than me constantly shouting to put his shoes on etc...alexa has been great after simply asking her, she wakes him up every morning with a fun fact, weather and a joke same at bed time. I've programmed her to remind him each stage of his day that he forgets through the app on my phone. I was worried about our Scottish accents being recognised but it works really well. Cons: The cost of the Amazon account to have access to music or books...has no direct ether port for rooms with poor wifi signals.....also she friend-zoned my boy also when he asked her for a date lol"
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Nice and versatile intro into smart speakers,Better than expected sound and very useful. Answers almost any question and good for reminders. Can connect to most Amazon products like Ring Security through Bluetooth. Downloaded the app and set it up easily. Highly recommended for starting a smart household.
5.0,3 months ago,Argos,I have always wanted one of these!,"This has always been a must on my list. The fact I searched for it the day before I bought it and a new one had been released with the clock was a bonus! All my family love it and are thinking to gift it to family as Christmas presents. The £7.99 per month prime membership to gain all access is well worth it, you can stream from many devices all sorts of things as well as Alexa!"
5.0,10 months ago,Argos,Extremely good value for money,Very easy to setup and the sound quality is excellent. The voice recognition is superb. I bought a new Panasonic TV recently and you can control it by voice using Alexa. The list of things you can do with these smart speakers is almost endless. It's so good I've bought another.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Does what it is supposed to,I was actually surprised about the sound that comes from this device. I was reluctant to buy this because of the thought of something listening in all the time but you get used to it once you have it for a while. Alexa is very responsive. Will give you the weather on command as well as play your favorite song. My daughter also figured out how to call the house through her Kinde through the alexa. I don't use it as much now but the device is very reliable when needed.
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Great once connected to wifi,Excellent sound quality. Took me numerous attempts to connect to WIFI. I had to reset Echo to factory settings and i finally got it connected. Instructions are very limited but good idea to look at you tube for instruction videos. Once connected works well.
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Brilliant little thing!,"This was my first Echo Dot. Colour fits in well with my kitchen and doesn’t make it look obtrusive. Great speaker sound. Reacts very well to commands. Brilliant for just a digital radio if nothing Else! I’ve got my Wemo insight plugs working with it so that I can turn on/off lamps etc. Also use it to control EWeLink switches. Very impressed and useful, not just another ‘gadget’ that ends up on a draw not used. Would recommend. Click and collect from Argos was very easy and fast. Great service."
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Interesting addition to the house.,"Wasn't sure what to expect when we got this. It's been fun to have, we listen to music, play trivia with it, use it to turn a lamp on and off with a smart plug. Someday will control the heat of the house. Alexa does just stop on her own every now and then. Not sure why. Bought this during a Christmas sale for $24. It was a good deal."
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Fine for what I need,"I was looking for an additional Alexa-enabled device to place in another part of the house, but wasn't interested in spending much money. This fit the bill, and I was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality. I also much prefer the aesthetics of this device to the previous generation of the Dot. Still, I wish they hadn't discontinued the Tap...*sigh*"
5.0,8 months ago,ao.com,I bought this to connect from Alexa in my kitchen to the bathroom it works great and for such a small speaker the sound is really good. Just a note for the safety consious the plug socket is fitted inside a cupboard and the lead is plenty long enough to reach out to sit on the windowsill. I wanted to hear my playlists while soaking in the bath but I'm sure it will be just as good as a speaker extension in any room within the correct distance as stated.,I bought this to connect from Alexa in my kitchen to the bathroom it works great and for such a small speaker the sound is really good.

4.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Good quality sound easy to use,Got this as a free promotion when I bought a TV. Not a big fan of people listening in so I decided to put in my daughters room so she could turn her lights on and play her music. Works very well for that. Still a little freaky though that one day they will be asked to testify at the hearing. Big brother is always watching LOL
5.0,9 months ago,Argos,Alexa is Super Smart,"Loving the white Alexa. The set up was a little confusing as there are no instructions (as per most tech products these days). However, once she was ready to go and awake, she was great. Very good for listening to music (via Spotify or Amazon music) and general info. Sound quality is good, enough for an average living room."
5.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Additional Alexa,"I bought 2 of these 3rd gestation Alexa devices, as I wanted one for my bedroom and kitchen. The style of the Alexa's are lovely and I recommend sand design which is basically white, which goes really well with a neutral decor. They are pretty much exactly the same as the Alexa plus, just with a smaller speaker, but we hooked it up to our hive and our hue and hive bulbs (you can link both no problem) which work perfectly. We have also linked it up to our tv which you can also switch on, one thing I would say is try not to put it too close to the tv as it might not be able to pick up your request when the tv sound is on."
5.0,8 months ago,Argos,Echo Dot small but mighty,"Purchased my Dot after buying the Echo. I am very happy with this. I have it next to my bed. It is wonderful not having to search for my watch to know the time when I wake in the middle of the night. No longer searching for radio stations, just askAlexa and voila there it is. Searching for specific tracks is simple with Amazon Music app. I love it."
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Love this product!,We absolutely love our Alexa Echo Dot speaker! The sound quality is outstanding and the device fits in any space very compactly. It has an endless supply of music and information. The best thing about it is that it was on sale for 50% off the regular price which is a very good value for this item! It's easy to install which is a real plus!
5.0,9 months ago,Argos,Awesomeness size small,After already owning the Echo Plus since Christmas wanted to add to the collection when this came on offer over the Bank Holiday. Does the same at the Plus but in a smaller package. Sound quality is superb and it Alexa is as good as she is on the other device. Easy to set up and log in and looks good. Highly recommend.
2.0,2 months ago,ebay.com,Pay the extra and go for a later version,"This is my second Echo Dot 3, and is an earlier version (2018) than the one I bought this year. There is simply no comparison, It looks the same, but that's where it ends. Trying to get the 2018 Echo Dot 3 to do what I ask, despite it operating from the same app as the 2019 version, is very hard work indeed. Pay the extra and go for the latest version...it's fab!"
5.0,a month ago,Argos,This echo dot is amazing,"This echo dot is an absolute brilliant product. The sound quality is excellent and as well as the practical features like alarm., reminders etc this product also has many fun activities.. Like song quiz and other games /quizzes. It was easy to install and set up. I'm very happy with my purchase."
5.0,8 months ago,Argos,Alexa. Does what it says on the tin.,Had a google home in the house for a few weeks but my wife suggested we change it out for an Amazon Echo. Noticed a bargain at Argos and picked one up. For us this works so much better as both kids can get the music they want to play any time they like. Still working through the other functionality but loving it so far. Recommended.
3.0,a year ago,Argos,"If you can afford it, get the Echo","My family has two Echoes and one Dot. The Dot is ok but the microphone and speaker quality is a long way off the Echo. To illustrate this, the room with the Dot is at the other end of a hallway to a room with an Echo. When in the Dot room, the Echo can pick up instructions intended for the Dot which the Dot sometimes misses. Our Dot is in a room with a Sonos speaker and the functionality of Alexa is all good. However if you can afford it the Echo quality is worth the extra spend."
5.0,3 weeks ago,Argos,"my second Alexa Echo Dot , one upstairs and down .","When in kitchen add items to your shopping list as and when required . Use the timer for boiled eggs , cakes and cooking roasts . Reminder for events happening daily . Tells me the weather report each morning . Reads me my kindle books . Wouldn’t be without it ."
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Great For The Price,"I am not much into the smart home devices but our kids are. So when I saw this on the sale table, I went ahead and picked it up. It was easy to set up and is fun to ask random questions to. Even bought a second one for upstairs and linked them together. May even now start looking into other smart home devices."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Very helpful,"This is one of those items that I did not really care one way or another if I had one. We received it along with a Ring Doorbell purchase and I love it. I have mine in the kitchen and use it for music, reminders, cooking measurements and questions, but mostly for adding items to my lists I started. I have grocery store, Costco, Home Depot, Things to do Today, and more. They go straight onto my phone so there is no more leaving the list at home and getting to store and can't remember all that was on it. My grandkids have fun with Alexa as well."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Pretty good,The dot is pretty neat but also somewhat complicated if you start pairing more than one dot and or devices. Everything has to be set perfect so there are definitely some growing pains but once it is all set then it’s pretty handy. If you have a smart plug hooked up to a floor plan and your internet goes out then so will your fan (in the middle of the night). Easy to unplug the smart plug and plug the fan directly into the wall outlet but nonetheless inconvenient. Overall it’s a neat addition to your home.
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Our 1st Alexa!,"This is our first Alexa, and we LOVE IT. This is such a handy device to check the weather, ask a quick question, listen to music, or play a trivia game. The speakers sounded great when we first got it, although after about a week it sounds distorted at times. Maybe we had music up too loud? We love how it connects with Ring devices!!!"
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Go Alexa,"I own both the Google home and the Alexa echo devices, after having parents both with my smart home devices including the smart things hub. I will be getting rid of all of my Google Home devices and going strictly with the Amazon echo. Usability of the Alexa is far superior in my opinion. A must have for all smart homes."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"As a Christmas gift, NO REGRETS!","My mother, who isn't tech savvy, and for others alike, this is an amazing gift. All the features they'll continue to discover and all that this device can do for them through a simple voice command brings not just convenience but joy and excitement to their living demands. From connecting her other devices to the Echo, music requests, learning things of her interests, tutorials on new recipes for dinner and desserts, and making convenient calls to family members...this device allow her to multitask easily and conveniently while doing her daily living activities."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Alexa is a must!,"The Echo Dot generation two, is definitely a must have! The black gives it such a nice luck… It’s very small so you can fit it in almost any space needed. Not only does Alexa brighten my day with jokes, she told me up and packed every day I wake up. If you don’t like the name Alexa you can also change it to anything that you need it to be. For instants, the week of them could be echo . It’s a great stocking stuffer. Wouldn’t think twice when purchasing! And having one isn’t enough! You’ll grow to love it!"
5.0,9 months ago,Argos,"Cute, compact design. Great product!",So I bought this as a little something to keep my mother entertained whilst I'm away with work or other things. She's used it many a time with ease as she's a technophobe too. She loves it and says it makes her feel less lonely. Would definitely buy another one when it's time to fly the nest.
5.0,a month ago,Currys,pat's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 3rd Gen 2018 Charcoal,"Pros: I do not really know as I purchased this for my grandchildren, 3 and 5. They enjoy this product and have alot of fun with it. Apart from that I cannot say more. They were more than pleased when Santa left it for them. Even the arguments it caused. But they now know they have to take turns. In theory anyway."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Is there an Echo in here?,"Honestly, I was skeptical about how much this would be used in my house, but I do believe that 'Alexa' is more popular than I am now! I swear if my family could ask 'her' for the car keys or money to buy stuff, dear old dad would fade away from lack of notice! Seriously, I think this is a trend. Kinda like those 'new fangled' computers back in the early 80's, the 'Internet' in the 90's, and 'Clog Dancing' in the 00's. Hmm... Well, maybe not the clog dancing... Echo, Where have you been all my life? (She'd probably have an answer to that one too!)"
5.0,3 months ago,Argos,Excellent for my bedroom,This echo dot is excellent. Had it for my bedroom to replace my DAB radio alarm clock. The clock on this Dot is great and adjusts its brightness itself. Sound is excellent from such a small device. It's simple to connect to the internet and does everything I need it to including my morning alarm
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Love it!,"I purchased this because I bought my mother for Christmas a firetv Cube with the built in Alexa. Since using the voice commands I had to get a dot to have in my house. I love the features and skills that can be added to make your dot more personal to you. Since having bought the dot, I did go ahead and purchased an echo plus and of course love it. The customization is pretty cool, I am an apple fan boy and all I can say is apple step up your game. I know Siri is intelligent but just the features on the software are pretty nice. Don’t hesitate."
4.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Decent Smart Assistant,Enjoyed these in different rooms of the house. Allows us to use commands to activate smart lighting from Phillips and control electronics connected to harmony by Logitech. Only complaint is the time it takes to ask it to play music from Apple Music and the dot responds this is not possible and you repeat this dance until it decides there is an update to install first.
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Surprised at how full the sound is,"I bought several of the dots for holiday gifts and manage to keep one for myself and I love it. I wanted a small echo device for the bathroom. Love to listen to music while doing all my hygiene chores. I was really surprised at how full the sound is for such a little speaker. The only bummer is, I have to plug it in."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Love these,We received the second generation as a Christmas gift last year. Love it better than Siri. We use it downstairs. So I wanted one for upstairs for our bedroom. During BlackFriday sale they had a buy this and receive the smart plug for 5$. Score. The sound is better. And easy to connect to my other one. Still practicing on the other options with our alexia app from iOS. I work over an hour away on nights. So it is nice I can go in the app turn on some music for my doggy to listen too.
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Making life easier,It definitely takes abit of learning to find out what you can do with the dot but it has definitely made life that bit easier. Being able to come home with your hands full of shopping bags and not having to fight with a light switch is great. Obviously there are other useful things. We put this one in my sons room who is two and still likes listening to lullabies. So we can tell Alexa from the living room to play them and set a timer! Gradually changing to a smart home one bit at a time!!
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,New Generation Echo Dot at a Great Price!,"I had an earlier generation of the Echo Dot and wanted to expand my collection to other rooms. I got two 3rd gen dots at a great price -- even better than Amazon. That was great. When I plugged them in I was amazed at how good the speakers are. Crisp, clear and loud! A great purchase!"
3.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Has limitations that made it a no go,Picked this up due to adverts saying you can output music from one source to multiple dots. While this is true it only works with streaming applications at time of purchase. So for us folks who wants to use music off of a device and not stream you are limited to output to one dot at a time. Other then that build quality is great.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great little smart speaker,"This sounds great , much better than my first google home mini. It came free with my tile assortment kit and I was shocked with its sound. It’s not great but it’s absolutely worth it’s price tag. Works with all Alexa smart products , the list is long. If you’re considering one , I’d say get it."
5.0,3 months ago,Argos,The Amazon Echo Dot is amazing,"If you want hours of fun and laughter then amazon echo dot is just the thing you need to buy. It does so much more than you could ever imagine, suitable for both adults and kids of all ages. I love mine so much my dad and sister went straight out and bought one too. Would highly recommend to anyone who is thinking about getting one."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Amazon has done it again!,This 3rd generation echo dot is awesome! I had the original one and I wanted to upgrade and I am so happy that I did! The speaker on this little echo dot is amazing and now I don’t need to connect it to a Bluetooth speaker for better sound. And I love the rubber bottom bc it stays in place on my granite countertops!
5.0,4 months ago,Argos,Perfect Gift,"I bought this as a gift for my mother as she loves listening to different radio stations, some of which are not covered in her area. A quick download of the Alexa App on her tablet and she was good to go. I have the Echo plus, so was dubious about the sound quality of the dot as it is so much smaller, but no regrets or reservations, the sound is great and she is really pleased with it."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Good price for a very useful device,"Already have a larger Alexa. Still have not connected Dot up in bedroom. While I subscribe to Amazon for music content, £3.99 per month, not sure if this one account serves Dot as well as larger Alexa model. Maybe you need Amazon Prime for more than one device - further exploration needed."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,The automation starts here.,Cracking little device to bring me into the 21st century. Keeps reminding me stuff and it’s so easy to ask simple questions and I’m sure in time the more complex ones too. Simple design and very portable providing you’re near a plug socket. Picks up wifi very easily and I’d recommend this product to anyone.
5.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Echo dot hits the spot.,Anyone who doesn’t own one or get one for Xmas really are missing out. At the Black Friday offer it was a steal and at the reduced price it’s at now its still a must have. Even when this goes back to its rrp I wouldn't hesitate to get one. It looks brilliant very stylish and sounds amazing with room filling sound. Amazon had a winner with the launch of the echo dot and Alexa in general and this device cements their place as the best virtual assistant and echo speaker available. Don’t think about it get one and see what you’ve been missing all this time.
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,My kid doesn't need to use my Echo Dot now. YAY!,"I’m not the technical sort, so I can’t speak to the specs of the device, but I can say my girl loooves being able to tell Alexa to play whatever song she’s in the mood for. I always hear music coming from her room, which is what she uses it for most. It comes in handy for homework questions, stories, white noise, or whatever you want."
5.0,5 months ago,ebay.com,Smart Companion,"The shape of things to come. When I was a youngster items such as this were science fiction! Alexa keeps me company with music on demand at a small monthly cost. It will tell me a joke to cheer me up, read me a story, remind me of an event and even tell me the days news headlines and sports scores. A very worthwhile investment!"
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,I love my Echo Dot. I use it ALL the time.,"Granted, she doesn't know the answers to everything, but I watch a lot of TV in bed so I'm forever asking it if this or that actor is still alive, or I have her tell me my daily news, or have her play music from my 80's days. Best advice though, change her name. Don't keep it as 'Alexa' or everytime a commercial comes on, OR someone with a name similar is said, she will chime in and scare the crap out of you, lol."
5.0,a year ago,Argos,New and up-to-date,"There's a lot to like about the new generation of Amazon Echo's; the fabric finish is stylish, the connectors are familiar, though the mains adaptor is different, hear well even from a distance and responds quickly to commands. It's extremely useful for controlling the heating and for playing music, but also very adept at answering questions too. A fun and useful addition to any home especially one that has a lot of smart devices. Well worth upgrading or purchasing for the first time."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Perfect for kitchen,"Bought this Echo Dot for kitchen because it looks great and can fit nicely anywhere. Device is extremely reliable, no need to shout or repeat what you say and plays great sounding music. Dogs sleep comfortably in kitchen to music while we go to work. Will buy more for other rooms in house..."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Echo Dot (3rd Gen),"I've got 4 of the 2nd Gen Echo Dots in my house, and this one blows them away. I bought two of these because of another review I watched that showed much better sound on these. It's true, these sound MUCH better than the previous generation... almost as good as the current Echo. I use one of the new ones in the garage, where I spend a lot of my time at home, and listening to Amazon Music is fantastic because I don't have to connect it to an external speaker as I did with the 2nd Gen. Setup was a breeze and it was working within a minute of plugging it in."
2.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Disappointed ☹️,"I bought this product as a Xmas gift for my 22 year old son but as he has an apple iPhone it is not compatible if used alone! He lives at home so doesn’t have hive or nest heating, doesn’t have the need to put lights on while out as we are always at home, uses Apple Music has free Spotify all of which are not compatible with this product. Maybe my mistake but I assumed rightly or wrongly that he could use this as a stand alone speaker apparently not. So overall disappointed. Lewis’s have been brilliant as usual and changed the item with no problem so all well in the end my advice check it’s compatible first."
4.0,10 months ago,Argos,Still in it's infancy!,"Build wise it's difficult to find fault but Alexa seems to know very little about the world we live in, is hearing impaired and doesn't communicate with the Alexa App very well. It can turn plugs and lights on and off but many of the Alexa ready devices just do not work, I don't know if this is a device, or Alexa problem. I originally bought this to show my grandson how things could be voice operated in the future, he's not that impressed!"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,She who shall not be named,You cant say Alexa at all in my house unless you are actually talking to her. It always hears you lol. The only time she doesn't listen well is when the volume is turned up and she's playing music. (The speaker is actually impressive for how compact Amazon got this thing... my klipsch sound bar is hardly used any more) and for smart bulbs to work you NEED a bridge that part sucks the only one you dont need a bridge for is the plus. The price of a bridge is about 50-80 depending on the brand. You also need to connect it to a smartphone for set up.
4.0,a month ago,Argos,Fun to use,Super cute with its small design. I've only used it for music so far. Be aware that to listen to the music you want you'll have to subscribe to amazon's music unlimited £3.99 p/m for one device or £9.99 p/m for multiple. Partner and I had fun trying to catch alexa out with golden oldie songs but she knew them all. Must keep trying!!!!!
4.0,a month ago,Argos,Good entry level smart speaker.,Bought this for my Mum for Christmas. While there are better sounding speakers out there the sound quality is fairly decent and can be hooked up to a Bluetooth speaker if necessary. Set up is relatively easy using the Alexa app. My Mum is pleased with it and overall I would definitely recommend.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great for a beginner like me!,"I really liked that it was encluded with my purchase of the TV! I am learning how to use it and find it to be NOT as hard as I originally thought! Thankyou for this opportunity! I look forward to combining this with other technological advancements that this has made me aware of! And, thanks for the GREAT DEAL of the television purchase that came with this product!"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Kids love it!,"Amazon Alexa was very easy to get set up via the amazon Alexa app. Able to control both using a app. I can make an announcement play through the speakers. I purchased two of these and the app gives me control to play the same thing simultaneously thru both speakers. I would recommend to family, friends and even my enemies."
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Better sound,Better over all sound. Louder and fuller. I already own 3 first gen Dots. Only thing I didn't like was the Power Brick thing was too big for the recessed plug over my kitchen sink where a clock used to be. I wanted to replace a Dot I already have mounted there over the sink and can't because the power plug won't fit.
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Love my echos....,"Bought three of these and added them to my other Alexa device collection, have one in every room of my 6000 sq ft home. Just love what these devices can do and then grouping them to allow for music to play in multiple rooms at the same time is great too, Lots of skills that can be downloaded to provide all sorts of automation, I have them control the TV, BluRay, fans, lights, in all rooms, very cool."
5.0,4 weeks ago,Currys,Jan's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 3rd Gen 2018 Charcoal,"Pros: Alexa has a dry sense of humour, try asking her to make you a sandwich ? lol.I bought it on an offer, so decent price, same as my other one which is sandstone - not paying all that extra for a colour! Cons: Useless without an internet connection (obviously) and remember to switch off your in browser spend option or you might get the kids Amazon wishlist through the door, along with the bill!"
5.0,a year ago,John Lewis,We love Alexa!,"Purchased this on a whim as a great offer was on for blackberry Friday so I got two! Sceptical at first but within a few minutes of setting one up (it is that easy) I was hooked. Do some homework on what will be best for you as it can get confused, we got round this by setting up a household account. Particular like the ability to play music everywhere and it is then throughout my house. Have now ventured in to using a smart plug which again once you use you won’t go back! Don’t be put off by thinking about something listening to you all the time, most smart phones do that already!"
5.0,5 months ago,very.co.uk,It Understands Me,"I bought this a few days ago and it is awesome. I’ve actually just ordered another one and four plugs to connect to it all for easy automation. I’m Scottish and Alexa understands me now that is a bonus lol. I didn’t think the sound would be good but it’s actually pretty darn good for a little box, the music is full and basey and it’s small enough to go anywhere"
4.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,better than expected,"I primarily use this as a bluetooth speaker for music with the occasional command to see what the weather will be today. Alexa is very responsive, and the quality of the sound is surprisingly good. Plus I think the design is pretty sleek. If you can get this on sale like I did (Amazon products go on huge sales a lot), you will not be disappointed."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Getting used to it.,"My wife is slow to adopt new technology. That is until I showed her she could re-order household items on Amazon verbally through Alexa. It took a while for her to get the hang of it. That’s why we have five years of furnace filters in the basement now, along with a lot of extra light bulbs. We really like having Amazon Music so close at hand."
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,We have one in almost every room,Put this one down stairs in the family room. Recently broke my hip. Only place I can get comfortable is in my recliner in the family room. Since we have one in almost every room I can stay in my recliner and still be in touch with everyone throughout the house. It is very handy to have and there are plenty of fun apps as well.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,ANOTHER GREAT AMAZON DEVICE!,"I have a few of these smart home devices placed conveniently around the house to control my other smart home devices (LED light bulbs, speakers, Ring Doorbell 2). I like how the quality is pretty good, nice and very stylish, great product from Amazon! Highly recommended for kids room so that they can stream Amazon music and you can drop in and have a two-way convo."
5.0,2 months ago,bestbuy.ca,Better with Robotics,"Our family built a Lego EV3 food delivery car with Alexa voice control function, absolutely loving it. Alexa has more support to DIY robotics compared to Google home assistance in my opinion. The kids made a short movie showing the capacity of voice controlled EV3, and you can watch it on YouTube, https://youtu.be/223eo0ISGuA"
5.0,10 months ago,Argos,I would be lost without mine!,"Bought 2 for my children so we all now have one in each room. The kiddies love doing their announcements for the household as do I, connecting was quite simple and overall they’re a good little gadget to have. They are children friendly and good if you have family and friends round as you can set up a variety of quizzes to help entertain. Overall really happy with the purchase, highly recommended:)"
5.0,4 months ago,Argos,Our new addition,"This is wonderful but of technology. Easy to set up and to join our internet network. Nice design, sits unobtrusively in the room. Sound quality is reasonably good. I would highly recommend, and will probably buy the next version up, the Echo One for better sound."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great sound!,"This makes an excellent stand alone bluetooth speaker, or use it with Alexa to play Amazon music. The sound this little Dot can produce is amazing! I never thought I would want or use an Echo Dot, but after seeing my parents get one for Christmas and the ease they had using it for a variety of things, it became a must have. Hook up a compatible power outlet plug and control any device you want, get the weather, sports scores, news, music, and listen to your Audible audiobooks. Love my Dot so much I now have 3."
4.0,11 months ago,bt.com,Nicholas's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 3rd Gen 2018 Charcoal,"Pros: I love that Alexa will read me a book, find answers from Wikipedia, run several timers concurrently (great when cooking) and even tell me a joke! Cons: Not really but I wish I could develop my own commands for example when making a sourdough loaf there are a number of timed stages. I would like to be able to create a ""loaf"" timer that would time each stage without my having to time each one."
5.0,4 months ago,Argos,My Echo dot white is good,The Echo Dot is v. useful for finding immediate weather conditions; finding the right mood music; and tuning to my favourite radio channel. I do feel the sound quality could be better. The volume controls are clearly marked and easily located. Overall I would give it a mark of 4 and a half stars.
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Fantastic device looks great,"Already have a similar device so knew what to expect. New generation model looks stunning and difficult to find in white, ideal for the bedroom. Simple to configure and add to my existing Amazon app. Having used similar products, the Echo's capabilities are my preference and still leave me amazed that something this small replaces the need for every CD I have ever bought! Purchased when on offer so unbelievable value from Argos, yet again."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great purchase!,"I am 78 years old and not tech savvy so I hesitated to purchase the Echo Dot 3rd Generation. However, we rented a house last month for vacation and they had one of these. Within five minutes of using it I was hooked and had to get one for myself! Love it so much I now have two! My husband calls it ""Instant Google"" as Alexa answers the most obscure questions instantly. I especially love the music capabilities of it. Great purchase."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Echo Do,"This is a fantastic product for the price, great sound quality. Can be used for many everyday tasks, shopping lists, weather, traffic situation, tv guide, as well as great music selection. I have only had it for 2 days and wouldn't be without it. Going to buy smart lightbulbs and sockets next."

You can ask Alexa a lot of things and she’ll always have the answer. She comes in very handy, I totally recommend.","I am already a amazon prime member I love all the benefits I get.

5.0,a year ago,Argos,Everyone needs one of these!,"I now have 4 of these and recently got one for a friend. This 2nd version is far better than the original. The built in speaker has a much better tone (the original is a bit tinny sounding and ideally needs a separate speaker). There's so much info you can get from 'Alexa' and, if you have one in different rooms you can play your music across all of them - I can enjoy music all over the house! Can even tell you when your car's road tax and MOT is due! Brilliant piece of technology!"
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Great smart speaker,Have purchased several echo dot 3 to use throughout our home. They can be grouped together and seamless music plays throughout our home. Have set up routines for bedtime and awake periods. Overall sound is fairly good considering it is such a small device.
4.0,9 months ago,Argos,Much better sound quality,"I'm annoyed at myself I'd just missed these being on sale, which meant I paid full price. That being said, these are miles ahead of the previous generation in sound quality alone. Loud with a decent amount of bass. Shame they're no longer micro USB powered but that's clutching at straws"
2.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,"Eh, needs improvement","I wanted to LOVE this. I had ordered it a long time ago and when I finally received it, I felt like I got a defective model. The sound is super tinny, Alexa doesn’t know the answers to anything I ask, and it’s so complicated to do stuff. I only wanted to switch from google bc I’ll likely be an amazon prime member for life. But it was quite disappointing."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Perfect for a smart hub.,"I got this for my mother as a hub to work with some smart bulbs I got her. She only uses it for turning off and on the lights, but she's happy with it. We got her a different color than the others we got just to be different. It is aesthetically pleasing in her room by her TV because she tends to lean toward floral decorations."
4.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Good audio.,"With echo dot it can fill my whole living room with it's audio. It is a small device but you will be satisfied with the volume. Plus Alexa is so friendly. LOL! You can ask for the weather, play with your favorite music actually there's a lot to discover what Alexa can do in a very fun and exciting way, she can even tell a joke!"
5.0,a year ago,Office Depot,Dots are Great,"I have had Dots in my house for several years now so when I saw these Gen 3’s go on sale I bought a few as gifts for friends. I could not wait for the holidays to give them out and the people who got them are just as much in love with them as I am. They are easy to set up and all they require is an internet connection and WiFi. My friend has poor radio reception and unusual music tastes so this was the perfect gift for her. I would highly recommend these Dots for anyone on your list and if you get them at a great price, that’s even better."
5.0,9 months ago,Argos,Smart looking speaker looks/sounds good,A great sounding compact design which competes well with its slightly larger speaker brother. Our 10 year old won't stop asking alexa to play this song and then that song which she does with gusto. Our 2 year old is even getting alexa to play her favourite nursery rhymes. A credit to exactly how easy it is to use
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Vast improvement,"Purchased for 7 year old daughter's bedroom (she specifies to Alexa she wants the clean version of her chosen songs, which mostly filters out explicit content). As she already has an external speaker, with no voice assistant, I bought her the 3rd gen dot. The sound is actually a huge improvement, over the 2nd gen, for such a small speaker and overall, I'm completely satisfied with the product. I find Alexa to be reliable and the Amazon music service meets our needs, perfectly."

From easily getting a weather report to playing trivia games to telling jokes, she can do it all. Plus so many other things I'm sure I dont even know about yet. I just wish the speaker could be unplugged so it could move from room to room easily.","I love my echo dot! Alexa is so much fun to play with and there are so many things she can do!

5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great assistant,"I really like the Echo. I have Google Home and Echo. I have compared the two and I think Echo is better in a few ways. One thing I do often is set alarms and timers. The echo can tell if there is another alarm or timer set on another echo speaker, so it is easy to turn it off from another room, this is not the case with the Google Home I have."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Nice addition to have Alexa in additional rooms,"This Echo Dot is a great addition for anyone wanting to control connected smart devices across various rooms. This device can also be used as intercom across various rooms to communicate, especially when wanting kids to come to dinner without having to shout loudly."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Still learning,The Echo was recommended for apple devices. Basic set up was easy. Adding addition links is more challenging. Wanted to add iTunes library and directions did not match what is on the screen. Still trying to work through it. This is for my son and he is enjoying it. The speaker sounds good. He likes being able to ask questions and getting immediate answers. Bought a WEMO plug that works well with it. Set up was several steps.

5.0,a month ago,very.co.uk,Very happy with my purchase,"Love it. I can play my favorite music stations, listen to my music collection, ask Alexa any question and get an immediate answer, ask the time and get weather reports. Heck, it can even alert me if I have a break in while I'm out. It is so good I bought another for upstairs so now I can listen to music throughout the house. Best item of 2020 so far"
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Works perfectly!,I always liked having an Alexa. Now my dad hates it. Says it’s useless and totally against having anything like that bc if his conspiracy theories. One day I put meditation/sleep music and that knocked him out. Next day I come home and I hear him talking to Alexa. Literally perfect as a “speaker” too.
5.0,a year ago,Target,Worth the price if you get it on sale,"Nice little unit. Sound quality is really good. I like you can connect it to an external speak with the 1/8"" jack. Just a personal preference, but I like the voice prompt of Alexa vs Hey Google. Much easier to say. Alexa app is nice. Just keep in mind you can't really ""cast"" most of your apps to the Echo Dot, just what is available in your Alexa app. (or Bluetooth) that said, it is a nice little device and I got it at a good price ($22)."

4.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Decent product,"Great product for music in a space you're working at home in, or need a quick review of weather conditions. I do not find myself using it as often as I thought I would, but definitely a nice add on to things. I do like the intercom feature [if you have more than one echo]. It does have a nice speaker, and picks up on voices well."
5.0,7 months ago,Argos,Another thing to pay for subscribe.,I brought that for my husband for father's Day. I was so excited because we need something like that in our kitchen. He was happy till we didn't find out that we need to pay every month for subscribe the music app. I know is not to much but in a year for listening the music is a ridiculous. We handle back and purchase the Bluetooth speaker from Argos.
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,3rd generation rocks,"I have two 2nd generation Dots and have few if any gripes with them. But when I received my 3rd gen Dot, I was very impressed with the upgrade. Audio has improved 50% imo. Volume and audio quality are much better with this model. I also like the increase in size and the fabric exterior."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Dollar for dollar, this is the best Echo product","I know other Echo products make better sound, but they also cost more, in some cases a lot more. For the pricepoint, this device is absolutely unbeatable. I have synced it two work with other echo dots elsewhere at home and the integration is seamless, playing the same music throughout the house is a good example. The design of this product is very upscale, we have all the different colors and they are an excellent value. Can't say enough of this MVP Amazon offering."
2.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,I prefer a regular Bluetooth speaker,There is a lot of things that the dot states it can not do. I’ve connected my app music to it and it only allows me to select stations not just the music from library. Keeps saying it does not have that feature. If you are looking for something to listen to music on I suggest getting another product. I haven’t given up on it yet but we will see.
4.0,3 weeks ago,influenster.com,"I love the amazon Alexa. It connects to my LED lights in my room where I can turn it off and on. However, my only problem is that I can’t control my Apple Music from Alexa. I have to do it in the Amazon Alexa app which tends to be annoying because i can’t choose the exact playlist I want. But I love using this as a speaker because it’s very loud.","I love the amazon Alexa. It connects to my LED lights in my room where I can turn it off and on.

5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Use two Echo Dots to create stereo,Sounds pretty good for a small speaker. Okay for casual background music listening. It has a physical mute button for the mic (in case you're concerned about privacy). The intercom feature for contacting other Echo devices is pretty cool.
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Love these little guys!,"I have an Echo Show, Echo Spot, and 6 Echo Dots, and I love them all. It’s so easy to turn my lights off and on, play music, tell my kids that we are leaving in 5 minutes, and send messages to my family, with just a few short word commands! I just moved to a house where we can only have satellite internet, and they still work fine, off of a basic, slow internet connection."
4.0,11 months ago,eglobalcentral.eu,Echo dot,I had no idea I'd love Alexa so much - I finally found a woman (Alexa) that listens and can be controlled. (Just kidding) Excellent product. This device saves a lot of time by automating my household items and by adding information and music to areas I spend a lot of time in. Eliminates the need from carrying a radio from room to room.! https://amzn.to/2NXTp7Z
5.0,2 months ago,staples.com,Improved Echo Dot 2nd Gen,"Look and sound have improved over the 2nd Gen Dot. Basic use and setup are the same, very easy. Recommend for anyone who likes to listen to music (basic music - it's not a high end stereo) anywhere in the house with wi-fi coverage, and can setup as an intercom if desired - see youtube for this. Love them all."
3.0,a month ago,very.co.uk,Sounds good,Great sound for size. Got 5 amazon speakers for new year so we can have music all through our house. Not so simple. Had £3.99 subscription that only lets you use 1 devise at a time not on all. Canceled subs and gone with spotify £9.99 with 6 months free and plays on all speakers. Not giving Amazon any more money.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Echo Dot Review,"The echo dot is pretty easy to set up. You can set up an alarm on the dot, ask for the time among many other tasks and skills. My favorite is being able to use the Bluetooth from your tablet and phone. If you have several echo dots you can play on the everywhere mode which will play on all the echo dots in your home at one time."
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Nice add on,"I was skeptical about the echo dot and never actually bought one for that reason. But when we bought our ring doorbell, Best Buy gave us one for free so I figured I needed to give it a go! It's a nice little addition. We actually have it in our daughters play room so she can play music and ask questions and stuff. It's a nice add on."
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,"Alexa, start a timer...","We enjoy our Echo Dot units. Nearly every day we ask for the weather forecast, sometimes several times a day. We listen to music, ask for general information, and set reminders and timers. We've really only scratched the surface of what the Echo Dot can do. We hope to add smart devices soon."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Works great. Better than we thought.,This model is great. The time light is perfect. It is bright when there is light. Then when you turn your lights out it dims automatically to the perfect setting. It plays great music as well and the sound is surprisingly good.
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Echo Dot- Black,"Bought as a little treat to myself. Really impressed at what this little thing can do! Found it really easy to set up and it and a good speaker on it. Volumes pretty good. Although sometimes the sound can go a bit 'tinny',which I would say is the only down point,I just tell Alexa to stop playing,wait a little while and play again and all's fine. I was surprised at how heavy it is given how small it is. I got this at a reduced price at the time but would still pay full price for it."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Very useful,"I really didn’t want to like this thing but that isn’t the case. I can’t say enough good things about it. Useful in many ways. Just ask a question and Alexa will answer it, control it, play it and remind you. Kids are enjoying it as well, Alexa, tell me a joke? Siri has nothing on Alexa!"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Nice Device to have,"This Echo Dot, was a free gift, as part of another purchase. I didn't even know what it was. Since then, I have found it useful, to check the weather and play music. Gotta be honest; the jokes are horrible. I end up listening to them, to see if they're as bad as I think. They are. Otherwise, the sound quality is good and I'm sure there are tons of other uses for it, that I'm unaware of, at this time. For free, it's great. Otherwise, I wouldn't have bought it, just because, I don't really need it."
4.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Love it! Great purchase,"I originally bought this just to control a couple smart plugs in my house but eventually hooked up all my hue lights, smart plugs, speakers, etc. I LOVE IT! Alexa is so handy! And she can talk to you if you get lonely lol. My cats even knocked it off a shelf 7+ ft high a few times and it survived. A+."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Good for smart home controls,"We got this in a package with another product - we have a Google Home as well. Both devices work well for basic tasks; the Google Home is better at answering informational questions, while the Echo supports more ""skills."" For example, the Echo will control our thermostat and work with our doorbell, while Google Home will not. The sound on the Echo Dot is surprisingly good. Overall, it works as advertised."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Fun and practical for the whole family.,"We keep this in our kitchen/dining room area. It's fun to interact with Alexa while cooking and eating meals. We use it mainly for weather info, trivia questions and background music, but our grandson has a ball asking it all kinds of things on every conceivable topic. Very entertaining. Once you have it, you'll figure out how it is useful to you personally. I think this would be great for elderly shut-ins or handicapped folks. We enjoy it."
5.0,7 months ago,Argos,Impressive sound & fun to have around!,"Love it, for the price it's brilliant! Although, if you want better quality sound I'd recommend the bigger speaker. Commands are not great with Deezer but thats not an alexa issue (I might try Spotify next). All in pleased I bought it & love that I can get things done just by voice command."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Blew my mind,"Great setup experience. Superior sound when compared to my other branded speakers. Fascinated by sensitivity to voice commands over loud music. Humored when Alexa whispers back at me. Joyous multi-purpose, functional, and fun buy."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,My mom loves Alexa,"Bought for my mom who is 70 something. I had to help her set up - easy for me. Now she has it in the kitchen, says good morning, plays the radio on it, and asks it questions - she's made a friend! Annoyingly if you ask for a specific song it asks you to pay for an additional service - which you say no to - and then it plays a cover version. I've bought another for the mother in law."
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Brilliant,"I love this device, sometimes Alexa doesn't get what I want but if I rephrase my words and sentences it seems to recognise my request. I play hours of music on it. Meditate with it. Yoga, work out, also play quiz games with my husband and daughter, set timers and alarms and even ask for facts and jokes. I add new skills daily. Really recommend it especially at lower price. I even gifted one to my parents at Christmas. They love it too."
5.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Great,"I received my Echo Dot 3 as a gift when I purchased my 2nd Ring Doorbell 2. I have enjoyed it, especially when I get up in the mornings and want to know the current temperature in Franklin, TN. I also enjoy having it play my selected music. I am planning on purchasing some connectors to use for turning on some of the lights in my house."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,This echo dot is amazing the sound is fantastic,This echo dot is so easy to set up. The sound quality is amazing. The music is why I bought it but it has so many other functions some practical like alarm or reminders but it has alot of fun things like quizzes and games. I highly recommend this product.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great small and inexpensive speaker,"I really like the 3rd generation echo dot. It is a leaps and bounds improvement over the 1st and 2nd generation echo dots. Amazon even offers a wall mount on their website for the speakers, hopefully Best Buy will carry them soon. Alexa isn't always the best, she doesn't always have the answer or respond properly, but as a speaker it certainly packs a punch. The Echo Dot is a great component of a full home Alexa setup."
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Love both of them still learning need the Geek Squ,The package arrived on time. Package arrived in secure packaging. I' ve been impressed with the Dot 3 since their arrival. Ordered a tutorial on ways I can have fun and benefit with my new purchase. Have several Bluetooth smart devices which since I've ordered some smart light blubs and plugs. I really want to learn
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Great for the elderly,"I bought several of these for my 79 year old father. They are great for allowing him to stay in his home by himself. He enjoys asking goofy questions and using the shopping list feature. The rest of the family and myself love the calling feature that he can use. When he falls he can have Alexa call any one of us for help, which has given us peace of mind."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Buy This!,"We got ""Alexa"" for a Christmas gift from our son. As older people - we were resistant to the technology and told our son we would never use it. He refused to return it and told us to use if for a month and if we still didn't like it he would take it back. We LOVE it!!!! Alexa can do so many things for you it's crazy. The most impressive thing is the quality of the speaker for about $30.00. We can listen to music, find out about the weather, set a time, control lights in the house and more. You should definitely get it!!!"
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Echo is gread addition to family!,"Echo is great, almost no effort for it to hear commands, customisation of smart lights and devices makes it easier for everyone to remain energy efficient, no more lights left on by accident. Great integration with other echo devices like the show, even when in another room everyone can enjoy the same content."
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Busy mom's personal assistant,"My new Echo is my go-to personal assistant. I Direct Alexa to turn on my security cameras, play music, suggest recipes, disable my alarm system, set up my alarm, and even add something to my calendar. I promise you that this device will ease your life a bit. Best investment in a long time, I am getting my kids one too."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Excellent Tool,"Was originally doubtful on how much we would use this. Received one as a gift for Christmas, and loved it so much that we purchased a second one. It's great when you have little ones and find it difficult to have free hands. you can add things to your shopping list, play music, set reminders, set timers, and so much more. we have a smart thermostat and we can set our the temperature from the kitchen. it is an amazing tool that everyone should try."
2.0,a month ago,influenster.com,I really didn’t find this any better than their older generations. It didn’t make a difference for me at all. We used it for about a year in a few different rooms.

5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great Product,"The Echo Dot has been a great addition to our home and easily recognizes my voice. I ask Alexa to play something from my playlist and she does easily. If you want a great sound, you will need a version with a better speaker or plug it into another speaker. I'm still learning a lot about it."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Brilliant for my grandparents!,I particularly bought the dot because it’s easy to connect and great to use between my grandparents. My grandfather had a major stroke 5+ years ago and has been bed bound ever since. I bought this to help him with his speech and keep up to date with the current date and times also the daily news as unfortunately he cannot read or see great.
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Great sound for a small device!,The Amazon - Echo Dot (3rd Gen) - Smart Speaker with Alexa - Sandstone has a great sound for such a small device. The sandstone color blends in nicely with my decor. So far I have mainly used it to listen to books from my Kindle collection and music (Prime member.) So far works flawlessly!
4.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Good and was free!,"Got this for free when buying an amazon fire tv. Very handy when you want to play music and use voice commands to switch songs, volume up and etc. Also the speaker is good although one day it sounded like it was blown out but it went back to normal a bit later. We never play it on full volume so no way it should have gotten blown out. We shall see over time if thats a glitch to it."
3.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Its Okay,"The set up is very easy. When getting it to learn my voice it seemed to glitch on each sentence, and if I didnt immediately respond it would cancel out. After I figured that out it was easy to get to learn my voice. But I dont really see much use for it. It would have been cool to connect to my xbox and tv to turn on but it constantly says it cant do that. Personally not worth it for me."
5.0,4 months ago,Argos,Still a little expensive,"A definite improvement on the previous model, better speaker. Amazon making improvements to the software all the time. I find them very handy especially like the ease of setting reminders and they're better for this than the google home. Although the Google home are better to use as a speaker network."
5.0,7 months ago,Argos,Great sound and ease of use,"Had been thinking of getting one for a while, and not disappointed with it. Easy to set up , good sound even for something this small. Thousands of songs available and can even connect to Bluetooth soundboard. If you are thinking of getting one just try it you won't be disappointed either."
4.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Good Speaker Small Room Speaker,"Bought this for the bathroom/bedroom. It is a small inexpensive speaker, so the sound quality is manageable. For the price it is well worth it with. Alexa’s response is faster than expected. I like that I can link speakers and play music throughout the house."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Perfect for adding voice control to any room,"The size of the echo dot makes it easy to place anywhere in a room however the cord sticks out very noticeably. The microphones work very well. I was really surprised how well the microphones registered voice commands even 15 feet away while speaking normally. For the size, the quality of the speakers are what you would expect. Its size and how easily it picks up what you say make it perfect for adding smart home voice controls to any room."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"My first ""smart"" speaker","I really like my new Echo Dot. I use it mostly to play music and weather updates. I just ask Alexa to play some music from my favorite artist and boom, like magic, it's there. The sound quality is pretty good. I use it at my work from home desk and it's perfect. Sometimes Alexa is not very helpful if you like to swear. She will just ignore you. Someday we will upgrade to a few more smart home products to see what she can do."
5.0,4 weeks ago,influenster.com,"We love our Alexa. Information, music, news. Pretty much anything you need and Alexa can help.

I can tell her to add the items as I discover I need them and at the end of the day it’s all there in my cart ready to go.","We love our Alexa. Information, music, news.

I have a gen two already but needed another for my bedroom. Man, the speaker on this thing is 10x better than the gen two. It finally works as its own speaker! And it's GORGEOUS. It reminds me of the Google Home Mini. I got the white one. I wanted a google home but realized how often I use Amazon services and it made more sense. I love it"
5.0,a year ago,Argos,"Stylish, discreet, great sound for a small device","Very simple to set up with my favourite services such as Spotify. Have been using in the living room and the sound quality made me almost forget about my more powerful speakers. Very receptive to commands and questions. Routines are very handy, after buying this one I set one up in my bedroom as a way to wake up to the radio. Highly recommend to anyone looking to add some reasonably priced smart functionality to their homes."
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Love Using Alexa!,"This was my first echo dot & we love it! The ease of placing calls, checking the weather, listening to music or asking any random question is fabulous. One of my favorite things is to use the sleep sounds to help me go to sleep. If you don’t have Alexa you are missing out! I will definitely be adding more units to my home."
5.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,I’m addicted,"I had never used Alexa. A friend has the echo and my daughter and I played around at their house with it. We ended up getting a dot for each of us. We are both highly addicted to Alexa. From setting alarms, to adjusting the temperature in the house, to play music, to asking for jokes, checking the weather, making lists, and so much more!"
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Can't live without it!,"No monthly fees! It's so enjoyable to have at your voice command what it can do. And it even gives you home security with notifications for glass breakage and alarm sounds (smoke, home, etc.) It can control home functions like thermostat (if wifi), and a ton of other devices (some might have to buy a module for to work), but all worth it."
4.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Great product that does different things!,"Alexa is a great smart speaker. Easy to set up and connect through Wi-Fi.

5.0,9 months ago,Argos,Great for stroke sufferer,"Bought to aid a stroke sufferer be able to check the time, the weather, listen to the radio and read books. The books bit was a surprise as Alexa reads kindle books from the point they are at. A life saver for someone struggling to read again and unable to use everyday things. Did it’s job well."
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Hello Future,"What can I say, it's like being in a Sci Fi Movie, I can now ask to have lights turned on just by saying so... So many things you can do with a Alexa enabled device..Play Music, Turn my TV on, Change Channels...the choices are I'd say limitless.. We enjoyed having one Echo dot and bow have 3 total around our house... I recommend this to anybody who wants to get started on having a smart home"
3.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Not to bad,These work on their own. I bought to hook up to my hue light bulbs. Setting it up was fairly simple. Sometimes alexa seems confused by what I want her to turn on. You have to remember exactly what name you set up. Tried setting it up tot he TV and other things too. Some things work better then others.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Amazing Little Speakers,"I love all my Echo speakers. I have 2 second generation dots & while I love Alexa on them, their sound quality is pretty bad. The new dots sound amazing! They are not enough to be the entire sound system for your home or anything but for their size they sound really good. I listen to music on the one in my bathroom & another in the office. Highly recommend these little speakers!"
4.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Improvement over 2nd Gen Echo Dot,Significant improvement over 2nd gen echo dot. When it plays music it’s a significant step up from previous generation. Also enables updated features of Alexa products - for example can integrate into Ring alarm to “listen” for broken glass when alarm is set.
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Amazon Echo Dot,"Bought half price which was a bargain from the off! Set up was so simple, just download the app and away you go. For best results I would recommend amazon prime and music which my son already has (half price student discount) . After reading so many reviews purchasing the third generation echo dot was worth it, it has a good weight to it and a good feel of quality, the sound was very impressive with no distortion. The limitations of this little device are endless, welcome to the future!"
4.0,7 months ago,bt.com,Helen's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 2018 Heather Grey,"Pros: Useful weather forecast & spellings. Also traffic reports.

It then asks should it continue, I say yes & it plays music from some other source that I don’t want!"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Just very handy to have around,"This gadget is great. Alexa is very versatile. You can ask questions which will most often give a correct answer, tell you the time, weather, set timer, set morning alarm. This device can do too many things to mention here. As far as the value, if you can get it on a sale...then the value is great."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,I Feel “Techy” Now,"Installing the Echo Dot was easy. In fact, it pretty much installed itself. I just had to get it set up on my WIFI, then Alexa took over. I got an Echo Plus for Christmas, and now I’ve added 6 Echo Dots. The Echo Dot does almost everything the Echo Plus does. We installed one at our vacation home and can control the lights from our home, using Alexa. If we are at our vacation home, we can turn lights on & off at our home, giving the impression someone is there. Love it!"
5.0,2 weeks ago,Argos,Awesome upgrade to the original Echo dot,"We already have several echo devices in the house, and this one was bought to take the place of an ageing radio alarm clock. The addition of the clock display makes this device even better than before, and considering its small size, the sound quality is more than adequate for what we needed it for. Would definitely recommend this !"
3.0,a month ago,influenster.com,The echo dot is a good Alexa device to try out Alexa as an assistant or add an assistant to a room.

4.0,a year ago,Target,"So far, so good!",I love my Echo Dots! I have one in my kitchen and another in the living room. They’re great to put music on while you’re cleaning! I also like the ability to call hands free while doing things around the house. The only negative thing I have to say is that some times they don’t understand what you are saying and will give you info on a totally different topic than what you asked! My kids love to ask for it to tell jokes and stories! It’s a great product and can’t wait to see what improvements come in the future!
5.0,3 weeks ago,Best Buy,Sounds good for the size,"Purchased 2 of the 3rd gen Echo Dot to complete my smart home setup. With the built in Alexa, we can set alarm and use this for voice assistance. Also streaming music sounds surprisingly good. Love it so much I also got the Echo Dot with the clock."
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Echo Dot delivers what it promises,"Purchased the dot for a Christmas present. I could not find it in stock on Amazon or other retailers so I was delighted it was in stock in my local Argos - priced the same as Amazon too. Set up was straight forward and instructions clear. The only issue I came across was when using Spotify, via an iPod touch. I couldn’t get Spotify to pick up the dot but was fine through iPhones. This may be human error rather than anything else though."
2.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Just not for us,"I’m sure in the tech savvy world, this product is good. Received as a bonus for purchasing multiple items & anytime you receive something for free, you have to wonder why. It’s just not for us and our household. Too difficult to set up (& we are very tech savvy), difficult to use. Passing on to a friend, that’s how much we won’t be using it"
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,So cool!,"I love these things. I got this one for my kitchen I have one in the basement in my room in my sons room and in the living room I have an echo spot So cool. I can control my smart plugs, ring and sengled light bulbs, even the light colors! Got some echo buttons and we have game night! The buttons can also control lights."
1.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Amazon - Echo 3rd Generation - Charcoal,"I received this product free with my Ring Indoor/Outdoor Security Camera. Had issues setting this product up from the start. It would not connect to my Wifi and gave me a number to call. I called the number and spoke to a ""Specialist"" that said it would cost me $250 to $500 to fix the issue. Sorry, but I am not going to pay for a product that will not work."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Love alexa,"I didnt know why i needed her. However my brother ask for it on his christmas list and i wanted to have it before him..lol well i now have 3. She reads emails, plays games with the family, acts as an intercom. And most of all i can use her for my shopping lists. The whole house likes different functions she offers. I thought why does anyone need this. She also keeps you company if you need someone to talk to or enterain you. Sings songs with you...just a fun addition to have."
4.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Solid smart speaker,"I’ve got three of these now, as well as the echo input, all throughout my house. Really helps to coordinate smart commands for your house regardless of your location, so I can control everything from pretty much every part of my home. On their own, these have pretty good sound too, and they’re solid, well-built devices."
5.0,a week ago,Best Buy,Great for listening to music,"We bought three of these to enable us to listen to music throughout the house. These provide great sound without taking up much space, and are very easy to control by voice. My only complaint is that these can't be used unless they're plugged in (they don't have a battery mode)."
5.0,8 months ago,Argos,A must for every home !!!,"Bought on special offer so a great bargain. Love the way you can ask questions and listen to a vast selection of music. Easy to set up have linked to a Bluetooth speaker for improved sound, not that the sound quality is not good from the unit itself. Very pleased with my purchase, and as always the service from Argos is 1st class."
4.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,"Nice, somewhat useful","Alexas get a lot of hype. I use mine to set timers, make grocery lists, and set reminders. My kids use it to make announcements and flatulence noises every five minutes. It is useful to hear a news recap and the weather. You can also call them and they can call a cell phone. When they're on sale, I think they're a good deal."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Very useful but not how I expected!,"I bought Alexa to use as a Bluetooth speaker with a few cool features I never planned to use. However it turns out that the quirks are better than the ability to play music on command. I love the alarm, timer, and reminder options which are extremely helpful as I tend to forget anything as soon as something else has my attention. It's great and especially wonderful to remind me to take my meds each day. My boyfriend thought it was so cool for these features that I bought one for him as a Christmas present."
3.0,2 months ago,ebay.com,"My wife was skeptical about my new toy but when she saw it work, she was quire impressed !","My Echo Dot, is a bargain at the price, but I think the speakers could be improved on. Overall the product works as expected and is fun to use and can be quite entertaining. It is a great product but not better than I expected. I would recommend it to my friends!"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Easy setup but not much info on operation,"Just plug it in and follow the instructions to set it up on the internet. Once it is connected to your wifi it works fine. But there are few instructions on how it works or what the features are. The manual that comes with it does not even tell you what the buttons on it are for. Sometimes it lights up for no reason. Found out this means it has a message, but could not figure out how get it to deliver the message. Needs better operating information."
5.0,a month ago,influenster.com,"The Amazon Echo is a great-looking, affordable smart speaker with the best voice assistant technology.

5.0,5 months ago,Argos,Fantastic Echo Dot,"This is one of those gadgets that anyone who can afford it must have! It's been a joy to see how different everyone in my household relates/ uses it ...especially my toddler whose speech is rather sketchy. He is improving his pronunciation, just so Alexa can understand him. A lovely, fun purchase!"
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Works perfectly with my Toshiba tv & Phillips hue,Great product came with 2weeks of Amazon music. Waiting for alexa’s whisper mode to roll out as it’s quite loud first thing in the morning and last thing at night if her volume is at 10. Decent speaker for playing music don’t get me wrong doesn’t compare to a Bose system/speaker but for a quick couple of times to get ready to in the morning is great. The kids love talking to her and finding things out and my husband never forgets anything anymore as she reminds you.
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Good sound,"I bought this because of the discounted price. I already have a 1st generation Dot which is still working well, and was moved to another part of the house (this purchase lives in the kitchen). The sound quality from the 3 rd generation unit is much improved, given the size of the unit. Connectivity is excellent. Very pleased."
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,For the price it was a good purchase.,"The Echo Dot 3rd generation took a while to set up. This I believe was because the app was not that clear. I still have trouble referring to the app for information. When the Dot tells me to refer to the app to solve a problem, I can never find the correct information in the app to solve the problem. Therefore, it only gets 4 stars."
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Awesome addition,I have used Alexa since inception having this dot version makes it more enjoyable. The product is made of surprisingly really good materials. Music and sound connection is way better than others in the same size and price range. Would definitely recommend this for all others.
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Dot is great fun,The new (3rd gen) Amazon Dot is a great piece of kit for the price. I initially thought i might need to shout across the room to get 'Alexa's attention but it turns out that it is responsive to normal volume at quite a few feet away. The sound is great for the price and a marked improvement over the 2nd gen which was a bit tinny. I have managed to hook my new dot with my calendar and even got it to control my older Sonos speaker. Quiz games are a lot of fun too. Still more to discover!
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Nice and compact for the bedrooms,"I purchased this for my children as Christmas gifts. Any moment now, I expect Alexa to file an unfair labor protection lawsuit against my family. My kids have been wearing her out. I imagine that they will get tired of her in a week or so but until then, Alexa has been kept woefully busy."
4.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Great product,"This is a good this to have - it controls My lights,my security cameras, and electrical locks on doors. They are all different brands and work Well under the control of this unit. When buying other elements/products make sure that they are Alexa friendly. If this is done it’s a great product."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Works great!,"The echo dot does exactly what you would expect it to. It serves as an extension of your other Alexa devices. It is very easy to set up with the Alexa app, you just add it on as a new device and it starts working immediately! It’s small so it doesn’t take up too much room wherever you decide to put it in your house!"
5.0,a year ago,Argos,A really good little speaker and more,"This is so much fun to use as well as being a great little speaker that packs a lot of sound. Ideal for searching the web, playing all sorts of music. The children love giving it tasks to do and info to find out. They love trying to catch it out and getting Alexa to tell jokes. A really good purchase especially when it’s on special offer. Have bought another plus an Echo too. We haven’t got around to using it as a smart controller yet but the time may come...."
5.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Awesome speaker and Alexa enabled device,Came bundled with our Ring Spotlight Camera system. I was able to connect play iPhone via Bluetooth and ply my music. Quality is great for a little speaker. Fully capable of using entire Alexa system by adding Skills.
4.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Much improved over first generation Echo Dot,I received this Echo Dot 3rd Gen as part of another purchase at Best Buy. I was pleasantly surprised on the quality of the speaker with this unit as I own of first generation Dot. Much richer sound. I use this device in my bedroom as an alarm as well as a sleep aide using one of the Alexa relaxation skills.
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Nicely surprised,"I hesitantly purchased this from urging from my son. I am pleasantly surprised by its usefulness. I can easily play music, ask questions, set my alarm, etc. The sound quality is good, the interface is super simple. Glad i bought it as a Christmas present to myself."
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Bought 4 and put around the office. Works Great.,Did have an issue with adding them in a group where they would stop playing after two songs. Noiticed online a lot of people experienced that. But after ungrouping they worked great. Play pandora on a couple and amazon music on others. 3rd gen quality seems better than the first for sure.
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,The Dot is perfect if you’re new to assistants,I got a Dot to experiment with Amazon Alexa. It works great with my Sonos Play:5 speaker. And I discovered Alexa Guard so now it plays nicely with my alarm system. Not the best speaker but let’s be realistic — it’s very small and isn’t intended to blow your socks off for that purpose. The Dot is the way to go!
5.0,a year ago,Target,"it's simply amazing, especially for such a very low price! I have it in my kitchen and am now able to listen to my apple music while I prepare the meals. The speaker is unexpectedly good. It acts as a timer when I'm cooking; a telephone when I want hands free conversation; a weatherman; it tells me how the traffic is to my destination before I leave the house. There are just so many things it does that I cannot list them all. And, I'm still learning its skills. A definite must have in any home!!!!!!!!!","it's simply amazing, especially for such a very low price! I have it in my kitchen and am now able to listen to my apple music while I prepare the meals.

5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Makes life easy,Does all the functions I need it to do in a life day to day basis. There’s a variety of products that work with Alexa that makes your life simple and easy. For me I’d prefer Alexa but it really comes down to price and preference. Google mini home is a good rival too tbh. It’s a matter of research if you can’t decide but Alexa is a great device!
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Bang For My Buck!,"I bought a TV initially and in the process of buying the TV from Best Buy I got this Echo Dot for free. I am very pleased with the device as I can pair it with not only my phone but my TV and Laptop as well. She's always listening and I haven't really found much that she can't do. Even though I didn't directly buy it, after looking at it's average price I would definitely say it's a bang for your buck if you choose to buy it!"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Wonderful addition,"We now own 6 different Echo devices and I must say this one is pleasing! The sound quality exceeds that of the prior version and though not quite as good as the regular Echo it is still surprisingly clear and has good depth of tone. Such a quick setup as well, we had it hooked up and running in about 4 minutes."
4.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Nice add on to Echo eco system,"Price is great when this is on sale and works with most of my smart home devices. Sound quality is too boomy compared to gen 2. Response is a bit slower than gen 2, but overall look is more refined. It is physically bigger than the previous generation. Great as a gift as well."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,An upgraded over 2nd Gen,This is an need upgrade over the 2nd generation Echo. The sound quality is better and you can connect two speakers for better stereo sound. The design is a softer cover feel than 2nd gen plastic feel. This model also keeps the line -in connector along with Bluetooth connectivity. Amazon really improved where they needed too. I love this look and sound quality of these over the previous models.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Who Doesn't Love Alexa? I Mean the Echo Dot!,"What can you say? It's simple, sleek, a little bit bigger and heavier than Generation 2, but this Dot delivers a much deeper sound. I do appreciate the sound upgrade. The bass is much better sounding to your ears. And there is a slight acoustic vibe to the lower range. The only thing I am not a fan of is the cloth material around the side of the device. Overall, it's a nice upgrade."
4.0,a year ago,Currys,Douglas's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 3rd gen (2018) Sandstone,"Pros: Sound quality is good and has an extensive range of skills (tiny apps) available. Can play music stored on your PC through it using Plex. Can be hacked to search Google. Cons: Uses Bing rather than Google for searching. Subscriptions are required for standard music sources e.g. Spotify or Youtube, including Amazon other than music already stored there.A great many skills (apps), are are of little or no practical use."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great product and looks nice too,"This is my 3rd Echo Dot. Have one on each floor now and use it as an intercom to send messages within house. Speaker is pretty good with this 3rd gen, but still sounds a little boxy. I have 1 dot connected to a bluetooth speaker for when I want to listen to music for longer durations."
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,My friends like these,"I got this for free with some purchases around the holidays this year. I have friends that use the heck out of these things and as far as I’m aware, they love them. They must... I gave mine to them because they were free and it’s not really my thing. But like I said, people dig these things. So does Big Brother. Lol Oh well!"
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Brilliant little gadget,We got this as a treat for the family. Its brilliant. We connected our Spotify very easily. The kids can use it. We can also play interactive games on it also. Well worth the purchase. I'm thinking about getting a couple more for different rooms in the house
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Echo Dot,Purchased at same time as a new smart TV. Had both installed by the Geek Squad. Works just fine. Was demonstrated by the installer to my satisfaction. Considering more purchases of smart devices for the sheer convenience provided.
4.0,3 weeks ago,influenster.com,"This echo is cheap enough during sales that I have to recommend it. Mine was literally $7 during a promotion. But it should have more capabilities in my opinion.

5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Echo Times 6,"I found an easy way to have stereo sound throughout the house without miles of wire in the walls and attic. It is called Amazon Echo Dot!! I have an Echo Dot in all Bedrooms, Office and second family room. Attached I have a Bose portable speaker. When I tell Alexa to play in all rooms, AMAZING!!"
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Great small smart speaker,"Have 8 of these in my house now. Everywhere I dont want to place a larger Sonos speaker, I place one of these to have Alexa commands everywhere. Has allowed me to show the rest of my family why a smart home is so much nicer. Will continue to buy these for more areas of our house!"
4.0,a year ago,Argos,Great addition to the home,"For the size, the Echo produces good sound quality. It’s great that it can link to Spotify as it can play a wide range of music. It understands most commands but I’ve found I have to almost shout at it if the music is playing at a higher volume. The Echo is a great addition to the home and can be good fun to find out what it can do along the way. I’ve linked mine to the heating so I can now voice control that too. I’d definitely recommend this Echo."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Christmas gifts!,I bought everyone in my family a dot for Christmas gifts this year. Very easy to set-up! I have my Christmas tree and porch lights connected for automation. I even added my work out routine with timers as a custom blueprint. The games are great too! I especially love the drop-in feature that I use to check in with the kids or use as an intercom! Alexa even connects to my firestick and controls my tv functions.
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Mostly Useful Dot,"Experienced some difficulty in setting up dot initially. Have to wait for a specific Alexa WiFi option to appear on WiFi option list. Had to try several times before option appeared. Worked mostly fine after that. Has disconnected from WiFi a few times after that. Alexa tells you to reconnect using app, but much quicker just to unplug and plug back in after 20 seconds. Then reconnects fine on its own."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"MUST HAVE for QUICK, HANDS-FREE INFO!","I have an echo dot in every major room in my home (all three bedrooms, living room, kitchen, and garage). The idea is to be able to listen to NPR (or any music or other type of programming) in any room with just a VOICE REQUEST! GREAT! I know there are tons of ""ALEXA SKILLS"" that would make my ""echo network"" even more useful...i'm sure I'll get around to learning some of them. For now, I am as happy as can be just being able to listen to news, get the weather, and a get a breakdown of my schedule for the day (oh yeah, it'll sync with your calendar and remind you of what's up). NICE JOB, AMAZON!"
5.0,3 weeks ago,Best Buy,Great sound!,"I bundled and bought this as an add on when I was buying the Alexa Show, and I’m so glad I did. I have it to my teenage son for his birthday, and the sound quality is phenomenal for such a small piece. He set it up before we set up the Show, so I’ll have to take the time now to pair the two so I can monitor the volume. Great price point- even if I hadn’t bundled."
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Wonderful Addition,"This is a wonderful addition to the home, it was a gift for a senior relative. She loves it, it allows ordering groceries and prescriptions. It allows listening all their oldies. It gives freedom at home. It’s been a god send. It was recommended by their physician to help out, right after she got out the hospital."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Awesome product!,"My parents received this Echo Dot with their 50"" smart TV purchase and they have been so excited to use it. Its been very convenient for them with the integration with their tv and they even purchased light bulbs they can use via echo dot. The sound quality is amazing and overall is an amazing addition to all their gadgets."
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Huge improvement over the 2nd gen Dot,"Well, this was a surprise. So many people go on about the fact that it is much louder than the older v2 Dot, and indeed it is. However that isn't anything like as important as the fact that the sound quality is *way* better. It's just so much richer and much more pleasant to listen to. OK, if you want to listen to something more intensely then you could do with something better. But to be honest, most people couldn't tell much difference...."
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Great Sound!,"Wasn't sure about the Echo Dot until we purchased it. The sound is great for such a small speaker. We find ourselves using the Alexa everyday. Morning alarm, joke of the day and items that peak our interest like how fast can lizards run. Useful and fun!!! The grandkids can't get enough."
3.0,a year ago,ebay.com,for that cost u can buy a good speaker. disapointing,only in English. u sell to Israel but we can not even download the app directly. even when we connect the device to the cell phone's Bluetooth it functions like a speaker and can not play music from the phone as a skill. instruction are not clear at all/ what app tp download from the many we found. how to connect etc. we got only a tiny paper with minimum details. can not play u-tube music or my play disk from disk on key
5.0,a year ago,Argos,So easy to use. I wish I had purchased much sooner,Music has never been more easy to listen to. Just tell Alexa what you want and she will find it. No more going around the lounge switching lights on or off. Just fit and install Alexa compatible switches or plugs then you can just ask Alexa to turn them on or off. I have my Sonos speakers connected via Alexa in my lounge and its now so easy to play all my favourite radio stations. I liked my Echo Dot so much I now have one in the kitchen and bedroom.
5.0,9 months ago,Argos,Little Echo - Big Sound!,"Have wanted one of these for some time as I watched others have fun with them, so I finally bought TWO -( discount deal in Argos) They are small, compact and easy to set up - just plug it in, download the app to your phone ( Apple or Android) and within 10 minutes you will have it connected to your network. In the 'value for money' range this is the lowest priced device but don't let that put you off - the sound is good quality and it is loud enough to replace a a normal stereo system!"
5.0,a month ago,Currys,Sharon's review of Amazon Echo Dot 3rd Generation with Clock - Sandstone,"Pros: So easy to set up. Clear sound, much better than my old radio alarm and more choice on what to wake up to radio-wise. Confident it will wake me :) Cons: Maybe different colours would be good for matching decor..."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Best Smart Home Assistant,"Amazon Alexa is one of my favorites. I have it hooked up to my Hue lights, Fire TV, some smart plugs, and my PS4 and Xbox One X. She is able to learn certain skills where you can tell her to tell a joke, ask questions, quote movies, and many more, The sky's the limit for what this device can do and the speaker is great for a small room."
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Answers My Questions,"Alexa generally can answer my questions. Sometimes you want a straight answer without having to look up something. Still, getting the most out of this device means there is a learning curve to develop the skills most important for a user. Not an impediment — be prepared to spend time learning."
5.0,7 months ago,bt.com,Raymond's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 3rd gen (2018) Sandstone,"Pros: Amazon Echo is an Alarm Clock, Radio, Diary Reminder, Music Player, Communication Device, Spell Checker and so much more. Also incredible value for money especially when it is on a special offer price. It was so good that I purchased three! Cons: No bad points to mention."
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Cool devise,"I received my first echo when purchasing another item. I was hesitant because of privacy issues, but realized that I’m not saying anything that’s all that interesting for any spy to listen to. Lol. I went back and got 2 more echos. I’ve set up a network throughout my house and can stream XM and hear it in every room."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,I just love my “Alexa”,I practically do everything with the Amazon Echo Dot. We have one in the bedroom and another in the living room. I utilize her to set timers when cooking and create shopping lists. Makes life a bit easier. I don’t know why I didn’t buy one before. Worth every penny and would recommend it.
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Amazon Echo,"Love the Echo Dot. Easy to set up even to link to Spotify. Good sound quality. Use it for news, weather radio stations and just music. Ask it almost anything,my wife gets recipes for baking. Absolute bargain. Use it everyday."
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,It's exactly what you expect.,"Bought one for myself on Black Friday and then turned around and bought one for my sister for Christmas. It's fun, can act as a personal assistant, pet sitter, news and weather station, alarm clock, translator, etc. Still learning the ins and outs of it. But overall for the price, it was a good purchase."
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Nice sound,I was in the market for speakers for my patio room. It was suggest I buy this new generation echo. I already have another one. I didnt know you could pair them together to have stereo until the BB sale person told me. It was on sale so I purchased this. I now have stereo in my patio room to any music I want. Sweet!
5.0,a month ago,Argos,very helpful,it’s very compact yet a little helper for every household. i got a little difficulty installing it but after a few hours i managed to make it work. what i love most about it is that you can link phone contacts and u can make voice calls using alexa. a very useful little device!
4.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Alexa is Great,"What can I say, Alexa is great voice assistant. Works great. Have one in almost every room. My only issue is that if I ask her to skip too many songs she won’t play anymore music and will have to reset her. Has happened twice. Maybe it was my internet. Will see if this issue continues."
5.0,5 months ago,Argos,Great little device.,"Bought this For my mum as a Birthday present well worth the price. Mum loves it and uses it almost every day also looks great goes with any type of decor. If you have considered purchasing an Alexa i would 100% recommend this, does everything the larger one does but compact and cheaper."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Already have same Echo which we find excellent. S,"I find the Echo to be so useful as you can ask Alexis anything. Have it In the kitchen where I can catch up on music from my younger days. but can move it to any room you wish. Would most definitely recommend this Echo. We have a black one, but live the Heather Grey which we bought as a gift."
4.0,11 months ago,ebay.com,"spotty sound issues, otherwise its good.",The speaker is sometimes sounding kind of blown. but other times the sound quality is great. Its very weird! youtube videos are the most common culprit of the blown sound. I wish I knew this before I bought it because I wouldnt have. I dont know if this is common or not though.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Got the New Dot,"Got the new Dot smart speaker and have to say the wait was worth it. I have numerous devices now and really didn't need another one, but thought it would be nice to have one in the bathroom while taking a shower or ""other"" duties. I heard for a small speaker, the sound was incredible and being as small as it is, placement would not be a problem. Correct on both parts. Larger Echo speakers have better sound, but for a speaker this small and unobtrusive, fantastic."

5.0,a year ago,Argos,"After failing to get a dot on the high street. or from Amazon, I was pleased to find Argos had stocked in bulk for an urgent Xmas eve delivery! The dot is starting to fulfill the potential of a world of connected devices. Within minutes Alexa was talking to Sonos on a separate broadband, playing from Spotify. My second effort to get Alexa to call my wife on her mobile proved less successful - Alexa help made no sense, referring to settings that seemingly don’t exist. A glimpse of the future.","After failing to get a dot on the high street. or from Amazon, I was pleased to find Argos had stocked in bulk for an urgent Xmas eve delivery!

5.0,3 months ago,Argos,Excellent item for elderly grandparent,"Bought this as a gift for my gran who is housebound and struggles to get around at home. She loves it - she can ask for the weather, make a shopping list and uses it to turn on all her lights All from her armchair! She also uses it to listen to the radio and set pill reminders! Fantastic item for the old as well as young!"
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Amazing echo,"I had this delivered by argos home delivery, amazing service so 10/10 on that part. The unit was up and running in literally 5 minutes after installing the app on my phone. Easy to use and great sound. Its taken over from my Google i had as its nicer sound and looks win hands down in my view."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Mostly works right,"Note: This is a second review since I purchased two of these. Overall the device works well but you are supposed to be able to set routines. Such as saying ""Alexa Good Morning"" and have it give you the weather, your schedule etc. I established two simple routines turn on lights, turn off lights. Both commands control three lights. One will go on and off regularly. The other two are hit or miss, mostly miss."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Smart tv Accessories,I bought this item a month after I bought my lg smart tv to the fullest. The Amazon echo dot works great with the lg smart tv. I believe it’s a must need item if you are purchasing smart tv to use specifications such as hands free control. The amazon does quickly connect to WiFi. Although I did make a quick call to Amazon to assist with fully setting the echo dot with my tv. Overall I will give it a 4 star rating.
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Love the Echo Dot,"I had the Echo Dot 2nd Gen and loved it, I love this one just as much. Alexa answers quickly and plays my Amazon Music just by the sound of my voice. Love using it! Also, if you have multiple you can make an announcement so people in a different room can hear you (in your voice). Absolutely love my Amazon devices."
4.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,It works like it is advertised.,Its fun to play with. If you have a smart thermostat it's nice to walk in and tell it to set the temperature. Might get some lights so I can turn on and off with voice command. It is NOT siri so don't think it will carry on a conversation with you. The sleep sounds feature is neat. We like the thunderstorms.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Nice upgrade to the older unit.,Was going to buy one for the ladies room. Then I saw around xmas time they had 2 of these for like $42. So I hot the one for the ladies room and replaced the older one in our living room. Glad I did because the newer one sounds so much better. Gave our echo dot 2nd gen to my pops and he loves it.
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Great buy!,"I was looking for a wireless home speaker system. I tried Sonos and Bose, and both offered great sound but didn’t offer the features I was looking for (Bluetooth, etc). These Minis went on sale so I tried them. To my surprise they did the trick and sound great. And for 1/8 of the cost! Not the marketed use (I don’t use Alexa), but who cares!"
5.0,3 weeks ago,Best Buy,Better than the ones before,"This Dot is the best of all the Dots. Much fuller sound, but moving away from a Micro USB connector as the cord is annoying. I'm pretty sure its because the unit needs more power to have fuller sound, so they have to have a dedicated power supply that can output more than what a simple USB outlet can provide."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great addition,"The Echo Dot is a great addition to the Alexa family. The Dot seemingly can do whatever its big brother, the Echo, can do. I use the Echo for my primary Alexa device with four Dots scattered throughout the house. To me, the only difference might be in the quality of sound from the speaker. The Dot will give you easy access to music, information, and weather simply by asking Alexa. Every Friday Amazon sends an email “Whst’s New With Alexa”. It is always evolving"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Cool and a little weird,"Wasn't quite sure what this device was all about. Started using it and the device is pretty neat. Answers questions, plays music and all hands free. Also a little weird, like having an extra person in the room. I would give the sound quality an ""8"". It is good but no where the quality of my wireless speaker. But...being able to just say, ""Alexa...play classic rock"" and it happens......that's cool."
4.0,2 weeks ago,Best Buy,Can't be mad at free!,"Full disclosure - My home is a google smart home, but this item came free as a bonus from another purchase over the holidays. I wanted to try it out just to check the differences between my google home minis. My only complaint is that I wished all of the smart home companies worked together and were all user friendly with one another...oh well...maybe someday in the future we can all learn to get along : )"
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Good compact speaker with the convenience of Alexa,"If you are looking for a good and affordable compact speaker for your night stand, kitchen counter or office, this is among the best options nowadays. Living in PR, US Territory, my only complaint was I had to change my address in my Amazon account to be able to use Spotify as the default music player. I have another Google Mini which didn’t have this restriction."
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Great device,I had been talking about getting an Echo device for awhile and my family and friends could not understand why I wanted one so bad. Then I go TV shopping and come across a package including both a TV and Echo dot for a very great price. I got 2 and now after setting them up along with the Alexa app on my phone my family and friends love them and the things they can do and now see why I wanted one so badly.
4.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Has many convenient uses,"This is our first ""listening"" device and so far it has surprised me with the various ways we use it. We have used it to check the weather, find out what movies are playing, playing ""calming dog music"" for our pups when we leave the house, set a timer while cooking and check sports statistics. It has turned out to be a handy device."
4.0,a year ago,Currys,Simon's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 3rd Gen 2018 Charcoal,"Pros: Great product. Good sound quality for such a small speaker and great value. Cons: We have 2, one in the kitchen and one in the children’s bedroom but can only stream music from Amazon Music to one device at a time. To be able to stream to multiple devices requires an additional subscription which seems a bit of a rip off considering that we are already paying for Amazon prime and amazon music unlimited."
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,"My wife's favorite home featured ""toy""","I got this for my wife for her birthday & she absolutely loves it. It does so many things. It doubles as a Siri, answers questions, you can tell it to play your music, tells you when the game is on, etc. The #1 feature she loves about it the most is that you can control your Roomba with Alexa. So multifaceted."
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Easy to use with good sound quality,"We opened up the box containing the Amazon Echo dot white and thought we would have to download lots of ""skills"". But surprisingly it was quick and easy to get up and running. Ideal if you are not very techie. We love listening to music and have found it very easy to access even obscure tracks. The sound quality is good too. Definitely recommend it to people who can't get a good radio reception so long as the have Internet access."
4.0,8 months ago,ao.com,"The speaker works well. Alexa is so quick to respond that there isn’t time to say the full title of the music requested. This can be frustrating. I have requested music as diverse as The Swingles Singers, Nymphs and Shepherds Come Away and Bob Dylan playlists. At the moment I am unable to access BBC Radio 4 playlists.","The speaker works well.

5.0,a month ago,Argos,Really good item.,"Great item. Easy to set up and use. Fun entertaining and very handy. Very cheap price for what it can do. You don't need subscriptions either unless you want specific song titles, it will play random songs of your favourite artist if you ask. Highly recommended."
3.0,4 weeks ago,ebay.com,Good item considering cost. Speaker sound is weakak,"Wireless functions rate 5 stars, speaker quality is biggest dificency. Speaker sound is rated by me at only two stars. Would recommend it if you have ability to route sound thru your own speaker system. Price is rated at 5 stars."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Great once connected to WIFI,Excellent sound quality. Took me numerous attempts to connect to WIFI. I had to reset Echo to factory settings and i finally got it connected. Instructions are very limited but good idea to look at you tube for instruction videos. Once connected works well
4.0,a year ago,Target,"Great Product, Easy to Use","My wife wanted this 'thing' and I saw it as just another waste of money. Well, I was wrong. It makes life, well, easier. All I have to say, is Alexa, what's the weather forecast... and I have it. No more going to my phone. If I'm in bed, I just tell Alexa to set an alarm, play a certain album and it's done. Quite easy, and it grew on me fast. I would actually recommend it. The only drawback I see is it sometimes has difficulty understanding a what is said, but I have that problem too...."
1.0,3 weeks ago,Best Buy,Not properly labelled for usage outside rhe USA,Not properly labeled for use outaide tge USA. Cannot download the Alrxa app. Cannot override the app. No customer service help outaide USA. Not usable. Not good. Waste of $30 . Outaide USA
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Great product and 3rd gen even better!,"Every day I find more used for the Echo dot. The sound on the 3rd generation is so much better. Really nice. Got one for my 92 year old mother and she even loves it. She is not one to adapt well to computers, cell phones and other electronics, but this she enjoys using."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,This is the 5th one I have bought as a gift,Have one for all family members and we have hours of fun with it. I couldn’t cook without the constant timers and reminders I set. Love my weather briefing in the morning and really useful for adding my bills up too. Really useful apps and very easy to use. Looks good too.
4.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Alexa!!!!!!,"Somedays you just want to yell at someone for fun. Alexa allows me to do this and not deal with them later. It would be great to change the name to help others relieve stress as well on a more personal level. Alexa mostly plays music and serves as an alarm clock. I cant imagine a life without her, she completes me. I shall call her, mini me."
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Good speaker,"Good speaker for being so small. Along with the show it makes great multi room music and assistant. It’s very large downfall is the inability to connect to Apple Music. I can use it to play my music via Bluetooth but then I’m using Siri to control the music. Black Friday discount was the reason for purchase, if you have the money and use Apple you should go for the Apple speaker. If you don’t have that kind of money I would recommend this."
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Alexa is great,"This is my first echo dot and I was using it primarily to stream music and use Alexa to take care of some simple tasks. Fantastic product, very low key and Alexa works better than Siri, Cortana and Google so far. Understands multiple people including children and does what is asked with no issues."
4.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Pretty cool,"I got this free with either my ring doorbell or my thermostat, I can't remember which. I never would have bought one, but I am glad I have one now. I use it more and more every day to play music, change the degrees on my thermostat, and change my light brightness and color in my living room, all with my voice. Pretty cool product."
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Easy to use just ask Alexa.,"Theres so much you can use it for.... Listening to your favorite music, control your electronic devices for easier use. Guarding your house. Setting timers and alarms, creating shopping lists.... The more you use it, the more you’ll wonder why you didn’t get it sooner. Momma dukes"
5.0,11 months ago,Argos,Great little gadget,"I got this for my mum on her birthday. She loves it! I have one too. I would highly recommend this item to anyone. So many uses within the home, from hands free calling and texting to looking up recipes, making shopping lists, getting weather, news and sports reports to reminders, timers and music."
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Easy Whole House Audio,"The Echo Dot is great for controlling devices (Hue) and for answering simple questions, but this 3rd generation is fantastic when coupled with Spotify multi-room audio. Set the volume to about 6-7 and it is really fantastic for ambient music in your home. When you can find these often has cheap as $20, it is pretty easy to build a whole house system."
5.0,a year ago,bt.com,Keith's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 3rd gen (2018) Sandstone,"Pros: With Amazon prime, accesses wide range of music.Easy to control, change volume, skip tracks, stop etc by voice command.Used equaliser via the App to get quite good tone, given size, certainly ok for background or casual listening. (Doubt ok for heavy rock tho')Like alarms, reminders & shopping lists! Cons: Not really any. Can't do complex searches & needs simple to the point commands. Slight faff loading ""skills"" (Apps) & some aren't great."

5.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Speaker itself has improved,"I have the 2nd gen dot, echo spot and the cube. They all connect excellent with external speakers. This 3rd gen dot has more bass which makes better as a standalone. The bonus free smartlights got my attention with the deal of the day. Bring back the promo again soon and I'll spread the word."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Gotta Go w/Clock Version,Not sure why they just didn’t put the clock in all of them. It’s useful as heck. Using it as my new alarm clock. Got to say it’s pretty awesome. Love the SiriusXM skill! Amazon has shipping estimates into March 2020 but was able to pick up from BestBuy immediately.
5.0,3 months ago,ao.com,I have one in most rooms and love how we can control the lights etc while out and about.

5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Teen Granddaughter loves it!,Bought for 14 year old granddaughter. She had it set up and connected to smart plugs and a bulb and another device in no time. Actually gave me some tips she discovered even though I have used Dots for several years. She is enjoying playing games with Alexa.
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Better than expected,"We got the Dot to supplement the Echo, and I was expecting the audio quality to be decent. I was pleasantly surprised to find the audio quality to be the same as our Echo, there's really not that much difference between them to my ear. Catching the Dot on sale also makes this a very worthwhile purchase for me and my roommates."
5.0,a year ago,bt.com,Stuart's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 2018 Heather Grey,"Pros: It’s easy to set up. It will wake you up in the morning without having to fiddle with buttons to set it. It will shut up when you tell it to.It will turn your lights off when you are ready to sleep. Cons: Frequently says “I don’t know that” when you ask it a question instead of looking for an answer on the Internet. If you go to sleep with it playing music quietly, hthe alarm will be just as quiet in the morning. You need to have the option to tell Alexa how loud the alarm needs to be."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Enjoying the Echo Dot (3rd Generation).,This device is perfect for the not so technical person. It is easy to setup and use. My husband and I have thoroughly enjoyed using our Echo Dot (3rd Generation). We are seriously thinking about purchasing the larger Alexa so we can control multiple items in our home.
5.0,a year ago,very.co.uk,Better than expected,"I already own a first and 2nd gen Echo and just wanted this for the kitchen, I was concerned that the sound quality might not be as good as the full size Echo but was pleasantly surprised, the volume is plenty loud enough and the quality is in my opinion as good as the full size version with good bass, this may be different if used in a bigger room but with the ability to plug in another speaker this shouldn't be a problem. The build quality is solid and it does everything that the larger version do, controls the central heating, lights, tv etc. I would thoroughly recommend this product I believe this is the best smart speaker for the price and with the support of Amazon it's getting better."
4.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Solid 3rd generation DOT,Great sounding smart speaker. I do wish Amazon had not changed from a USB style power supply. I was able to plug the 2nd generation DOT directly into my wall outlet (which had 2 USB ports). The new adapter takes up too much space around the outlet and I end up losing access to one of my ac outlets.
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Great little gadget.,"Great little gadget, but with a big sound. Ok it’s not going to be like listening to your favourite band at the 02, but for what it is it’s bang on. Easy to set up, and you can ask Alexa some daft questions, and get some hilarious answers. Like I said it’s a great gadget and a great buy."
4.0,a year ago,bestbuy.ca,Very Good Sound Quality for the Size,"I have both this Echo Dot and the Google Home Mini. The 3d generation Echo Dot definitely has the better sound quality of the two, and sound quality is pretty good for the small size of the device. As an assistant, Google seems much better at recognizing queries and coming up with useful answers. In terms of controlling household devices, both are pretty much equal - much of the home control capability will also depend on the brand of device you are controlling."

4.0,a year ago,Argos,Great Add-on gadget,"We also have the third-gen echo in normal size. This amazon dot is an excellent add on to it. It was a gift for my birthday and I was over the moon, our dot sits in our kitchen and is great for reading out recipies or playing music. One thing I would say is, if you want it for playing music I would personally go for the bigger version because it has a sub woofer and makes it much bassier. The dot has loud speakers however with no sub woofer installed , it’s not as good quality for bass lovers"
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Worth the wait!,"I felt like I was the last person in the country to own an ""Alexa"" device. Visiting our son in California and seeing how his family used their Echo Dot was what got me to purchase our own device. Easy to set-up, easy and fun to use; to a baby-boomer like me I am reliving the early Star Trek episodes every time I say ""Alexa""."
4.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Good starter Device - Better than 2nd Gen,"I got this as a warranty replacement for a 2nd Generation Dot that kept dropping the network connection. I haven't had this one long enough to see if it has the same flaw (I have 2 Dots Gen 2 but only one was under extended warranty), so I'm still living with that one but he Gen3 seems to be better. Sound quality also seems to have improved."
2.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Wave of the future,"Speaker on the 3rd gen remains fairly basic however to be able to tap into AI through Alexa is great. The app feature comes in handy to set up grocery, to do, and shopping list. Alexa actual has is great if your news junky also reminders, calendar events, music and audible books. Not to mention the ease of ordering products directly from amazon. The set up is pretty easy on the echo to your apple phone. I would say for 25 bucks buy it ."
4.0,a month ago,Argos,Good little device,Bought this as a result of using this at my sisters. There are things you can ask that make you howl with laughter. It's now competition for my Google home. Still trying to get them to have an argument between themselves though. Flexible and useful. Good value and my grandaughter (5) loves it
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Better than I expected,"I’m still learning exactly what the Echo Dot is capable of, but so far I like it a lot. The Echo Dot can be paired with the Amazon Firestick for both control of the device and sound. This is great in the bedroom. The sound is good (not amazing, but I don’t think it’s fair to expect amazing sound like you’d get in a Beats Pill or Bose portable speaker). For the price ($25) I’ve purchased several to integrate into our house. Seems to be a bit finicky, which is why I’ve given it 4 stars instead of 5."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,It just keeps getting better and better,This is by far greater then the 2nd Gen. The sound of this Amazon - Echo Dot 3rd Gen just blew me away when I heard it for the very first time. It literally filled the entire room with its robust sound. This is a purchase that I will never regret. I ended up buying 5 more and I just need 3 more and I'll have every room and hallways filled with my music. they can all play the same thing at the same time or whatever I prefer to listen to in a particular room.
5.0,7 months ago,Argos,Looks good,"Amazing little gadget. I ordered one and within a week had three. Great sound for something so small and answers any question you ask, plays music from your phone and after you've connected once through bluetooth all you need to do is say connect my device. I have also bought another two for Christmas presents. Love it"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great satellite smart speaker!,"We already have an Echo Show for the bedroom, but quite frankly, it's mostly the speaker part we use more than the screen, mostly for Pandora and Podcasts. I got the 3rd gen Echo dot to use in the bathroom as a satellite ""radio"" I can control by voice from the bathtub and/or take with me for travel. The sound is excellent for such a small size and the blue-green ring is very nice, especially in a darkened room. List price is a bargain, but getting it at one of the Amazon sale periods is a total steal!"
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,My son loves this,"I had bought this for my 9 year old son for Christmas for his bedroom. He uses it as his morning alarm clock, bedroom Stereo, and asks it what ever random question that may pop into his head while playing in his room. When I upgrade my light switches Alexa will be able to control those as well."
5.0,10 months ago,Currys,Paul's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 2018 Heather Grey,"Pros: Small compact device, not too bad sound at low volumes, sounds better in a smaller room but can be connect to an external amplifier for larger areas. Cons: You need to subscribe to Amazon music to get the best out of this device, we have prime which comes with some songs but it’s frustrating when you’re told to upgrade to hear something asked for."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Love love love!,Love Amazon Alexa products. I have a few of the different Alexa products. In my honesty opinion the echo dot is the best one. It’s a great low budget price compared to some of the other models. It isn’t as loud as the large ones. But it still does have a great volume range. I prefer having the dots and it’s more affordable to put in multiple rooms and get more benefits of what this device has to offer.
5.0,10 months ago,Office Depot,Great product! Easy to use and control.,"I purchased one for our office and loved it so much, I purchased another one for my house. Although it needs to be plugged in to work. That is the only downfall, but I guess it needs to be plugged in to always be alert and ready to control with voice commands? Overall, awesome. Would highly recommend it."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,improvement over the previous generation,"I have several echos. I do believe that have at least 1 of each model they has been made. This DOT is a huge improvement over the Gen 1 and Gen 2. The sound is much better, and the voice recognition is better on this model as well. Not that you would want to listen to music from this device all of the time, it does not compare to the larger models, but it is a vast improvement over the past models. I would recommend."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Practical device for the elderly,"I purchased this echo for my grandmother. She uses the shopping feature a lot, we also have it linked the her LED programmable lights so, she can just tell it to turn the lights on and off. The speaker is loud enough that she can hear it and it can follow her around the room and the lights on it show where it's listening from. Downloading the app to her Samsung phone was easy and she can easily move around the app. I would definitely recommend this to others."
5.0,7 months ago,Kohl's,Very useful,"We have the Amazon Echo Dot 2nd generation and thought that one was good. This one is better. It is a little bigger than the other and has a material feel around it. My husband loves all these types of gadgets. It is very useful for info, music, etc. The sound is great!"
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Great smart speaker I have 3 setup,I have 3 setup around the house. What I like about it is you just ask her to play something or ask a question you get results right away. I have them hooked up to stereo's 1 in the garage so when i'm working in there I have my music . I have one setup in the yard the same way so sitting around the pool you have music of your choice.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,I luv Alexa!,I have many Echo devices including the first gen echo dots. These have better sound and better mic reception. It can be too loud if you turn it up all the way. I only have it about half way. I primarily use it for home automation tasks and music. Works perfectly!
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Fun to use!,"I got this as a bonus when purchasing another item. It is fun to use. I can ask it questions like what is the weather, or what time is it if I’m too busy to look up the information direction. I use it to listen to my radio station or a particular artist, place orders on Amazon, play Jeopardy, and many other things. It’s just a fun, little device!"
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,We all need an Echo,Hard to imagine before having an Echo in the house. We have the video version downstairs and wanted one for upstairs. Great addition to ask those quick questions and play your favorite music. The Echo Dot version is at a perfect pricepoint to add to additional rooms.
3.0,a month ago,Argos,Good sound quality and easy to use,"Bought 2 of these for my kids. Very easy to setup, use and great sound quality. Major drawback is not being able to play different music on each echo simultaneously as they are both linked to one amazon account. I hadn’t realised this before purchasing."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Fab addition to the home,Bought this as a Christmas present for the family. We have had great fun with it so far with all the little things it can do.

5.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Nice!,I have had mine for a few months now and I love it! It was easy to set up and use. I’m still learning about all the things it can do! Right now I use it mostly as a speaker and to keep backup alarms set in case my phone alarms don’t go off for whatever reason. It has a nice sound for such a small device too. Suits my purpose for it.
5.0,10 months ago,Argos,Excellent,"This was bought alongside a firestick for my Mum, Argos were doing a bundle with both for a cheap price. Was excellent value. I'd recommend anyone to get an Echo Dot, it can be used to control many household devices which are Alexa enabled (the list of those are growing) Also you can ask it questions and what the weather might do for the following day or whatever."
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Adds extra usefulness to DOT,Having the clock readout is nice in the bedroom. Sound is very good and it is responsive. Wish it was easier to read at night for older eyes. I think shining through the grill cloth introduces too muck fuzziness or perhaps the led color or size could be improved. All in all very good for the price
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great for expansion,"I decided to dip my foot into home automation and routine building by starting with an echo dot. It's easy to set up and use and doesn't experience much, if any, problems. I like the physical microphone disconnect. After a week I already started expanding into other rooms."
4.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Alexa and her Dot3 are excellent music streamers,when connected to your amp via 3.5mm into RCA cables. Her SQ is superior to the Chrome Cast Audio's analog output and on par with the CCA's digital output into an outboard DAC. I knocked off one star because one of my Dot3's 3.5mm output connection failed.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,My Smart Home Is Run With Several Ech Dots,I have a total of four Echo Dots strategically placed throughout my home. I love using them to stream music and radio stations to every room in my home. The sound quality on the new Generation 3 version is a great improvement over the 2 previous versions. In addition setting up two as a stereo setup is great for listening to my favorite music.
5.0,a week ago,Argos,Echo dot clock is brilliant,This device is fantastic especially with the clock feature its a great alarm very simle and easy to use. We look all over to get one the only place was argos in St Helen's so we deserved it we drove from chorley not to far the staff was really helpful shop very clean would definitely recommend argos and the echo dot clock
4.0,a year ago,Argos,Really handy device,"I bought this for my husband for his birthday with the attempt of entering this new futuristic lazy world where you can ask ""Alexa"" to do things for you whilst you dont have to move from your chair. We're limited at the moment as only have a few smart devices in the home but its great to listen to the radio as it has brilliant sound quality and volume control. We will be buying other smart devices such as lighting etc. Only downside is she cant make you a brew!! Theres still time I guess."
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,I like the sound,"Sound is way more louder than the 2nd and I love it. I have to connect the 2nd Gen with a portable speaker to make it sound better but for the 3rd I don’t really need that speaker no more. And also respond faster. Overall, great experience. And last word, Best buy never disappoint me so far. Thanks."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great little speaker,I love this speaker. It works really well and has a decent sound for it's size. It's great to be able to tell it to add something to my shopping list right when I'm thinking about it or to ask the weather or what's on my calendar when I get up. I'm sure there are tons more features that I haven't had a chance to even try yet.
4.0,a year ago,Argos,"Love an echo dot, got 3 in the house now",Argos were the only ones who had these left and o wanted to get a third for my bedroom. So glad I did as the 3rd gen has a much more powerful speaker and it’s so handy to pair with my iPhone and a more powerful Bluetooth speaker for when I need more volume. Plus if you have other connected things like Nest/Hive and Hue bulbs etc then using the IFTTT app combined with the Alexa app you can make everything in your home work with voice control.
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great product it’s my second one!,I really enjoy it! It’s my second one I had the first generation. The price was better than the original one. Will definitely recommend it for the the value and great performance it gives. Greater sound than the first gen also!
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Great for small gifts to clients!,Works great for home and office use. This one I bought for my client but I've had one for over 2 years and works perfectly fine. So many great features but I'm basic and only use it as an alarm to wake up and occasional reminders/timers. I buy these all the time for housewarming/client gifts.
5.0,a month ago,Argos,The gadget every home should have.,"I never knew how easy life would be with Alexa in my life. It’s incredibly simple to use and once, I had connected the Amazon Echo Dot to Smart Things, I was able to control all my electronic devices with a simple command. In my opinion, the Echo Dot is probably the best priced Personal Assistant on the market right now."
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Far better than previous generation.,I have two echo dot right now with this model. It can also be modified as stereo speaker. One act as left and other act as right speaker. It has good bass for the speaker. Color and the construction makes it looks like a premium product.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great device!,"Purchased our second Alexa Dot (3rd generation) to work in conjunction with the first Alexa Dot (3rd generation) purchased a month or two prior. Also to work with our Amazon Smart Plugs, Amazon Cloud Cams, and iPhone and iPhone Alexa apps. Easy to set up and easy to use. Purchased the first Alexa Dot via Amazon directly. Purchased the second Alexa Dot from Best Buy, same day ordering, same day pickup, same pricing."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Echo Dot 3rd gen,"I purchased this Echo Dot 3rd generation kinda on a want, but not sure if I was going to like it. Got it home, read the instructions, and started using it. I love this little speaker that is voice activated. It answers questions, It will play whatever music or station I ask it to. And last but not least you can even voice prompt it to set wake up alarms like and alarm clock. It's just an awesome little machine!"
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Definitely makes life easier,"We primarily use Alexa for keeping our shopping lists, checking the weather, outside temperature, setting reminders, and playing the radio and music from our Apple Music account. Overall, we find it very useful. The only negative is we don't have a lot of time to really learn all the other features or functions it can do for us."
5.0,2 weeks ago,Best Buy,Screw Siri,Hey Siri. What time is it? “Hmmm. Let the think about that. Here’s what I found in the web.” What a joke. Alexa is the way to go if you want actual answers and help. If you don’t mind giving up your personal info to Bezos. Otherwise great product.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Obsessed,"At first I thought the ring was gimmicky and silly. When I received one for free after purchasing a ring, I became addicted. This might be the best piece of technology invented over the last decade. I would trade my phone for Alexa. This seems more like a personal assistant than technology. Alexa blows Siri out of the water... I can no longer use Siri on my new IPhone, because the echo dot is so great."
4.0,6 months ago,ebay.com,"Alexa fun to have her around, for quick info if she knows it!","I think this is a fun item, you get the daily weather, play music, reminders, pla games etc. It's still new to me so the more I have it the more I will learn. But there are still things you ask Alexa, and she doesn't know, she will say I don't know that one, and you can find it yourself online. She needs updated with a lot of stuff!"
3.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Good for those they don’t mind a little risk,"I don’t use mine (I have 6). I do have friends that use them and really like turning in lights, alarms, etc... by voice. I don’t like the thought of people listening in, so I don’t use these. For those that don’t mind, they are a great convenience and entry into smart home functionality."
4.0,a year ago,very.co.uk,"Good, but","I bought this to add to my collection, my collection is now finished. This 3d gen is no different to the earlier models apart from it has a deeper voice and and lots of bass when 0laying music. I don't know what it is, but the newest 2 alexas I've bought they dont seem to be able to understand and often do random unasked things. The earlier models are definitely better. Fast delivery by very though. Next day. Looks nice in grey."
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,It's Aight.,I'm not really Savvy to Voice Command Technology. That being said the more precise you are with your queries the better results you will receive when using echo. It's basically an intermediary between you and the internet it takes a little getting used to as your input has to be thought out before hand. The family and I have enjoyed putting it to the test and feeling out its capabilities. So far I really don't have any tips or tricks to offer up but will continue to explore and learn.
4.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Works great. Not the most functional device.,"It works perfectly as it should . . . It just doesnt do much. I can’t listen to my music from other streaming services. Unless you plan on convering your entire house using compatible products, don’t expect to get much use out of this device."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Improved and Excellent,"I have several Amazon Echo variants throughout my house. This 3rd generation is such an improvement in terms of look, feel, and sound quality. It takes more power so it’s no longer a USB based power cord which may annoy some long time folks, but for pretty much everyone else, it’s an improvement all around. Highly recommended. And it’s a great first Echo (Alexa) to get for someone."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Christmas Gift,"I purchased this for my youngest son for Christmas and have been very pleased. He uses it as an alarm, to play music, to help search with his homework. It was easy to connect to our WI-FI and the sound is AMAZING. I have purchased an Echo Show 8 for our family room and can’t wait until it arrives. I highly recommend the Echo Dot"
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Really good sound quality,"Great sound quality for such a small device. Alexa works so well with Spotify, Audible, and my Amazon music account. I use it in the kitchen all the time to set multiple timers, check the weather forecast, determine the current time, call family members, etc. So helpful!"
5.0,5 months ago,Argos,Great piece of very clever kit,"Really impressed, easy to connect and use. Speaker quality is ok, but considering the size of the unit it’s about as much as one might hope for. That aside, very pleased with it, next day delivery from Argos to a local sainsbury store so I am a happy customer and happy to recommend the product and Argos."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Brilliant,When these were first released I thought Whats the point in those. Not for me. Few months ago I was really interested and brought one. Best thing ever!! Makes certain tasks so much easier and you can have a lot of fun with them too. Id be lost without this fun gadget now
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Much better sound than previous generation Dots,"I have a few 2nd gen Dots which don't sound good enough to listen to music. I use them just to get voice control functionality in some extra rooms. This 3rd gen Dot sounds much better, so I'll be moving it to a room where I might sit and listen to music."
5.0,10 months ago,Argos,A Must Have,"After purchasing an Amazon Echo Plus I was so pleased with it, the sound is fantastic. So purchased an Echo dot for the bedroom and the sound from it wow!!! For such a little thing is brilliant., its easy to pair up with the Echo plus also a great price as it was on offer. I can highly recommend buying the Echo Dot"
5.0,2 months ago,very.co.uk,Very slick,"I bought this a few days ago and it's never off, small sleek design, good volume, alexa does not answer when you say her name just glows. Set up I had it to far away from the wifi for set up so took longer than should, but once realised no time at all just have wifi code to hand. Recomend as it takes away routing through your phone for songs and frees up your phone too."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Anazing,"Love it, it’s amazing.I just as Alexa to add to my shopping list and it goes to my phone. If I’m about to snooze on the sofa and don’t really have much time, just tell her to set alarm for 30 minutes. Quick nap otherwise I’d be there for a couple of hours. Most of her jokes are quite funny and she tells me my horrorscope every morning. Highly recommend it."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Brought as a second Alexa,"Brought the Alexa dot in the half price sale as a second one for the home, to be kept in the kitchen useful for timer and recipes etc.. The sound on the 3rd Generation is so clear and loud. The newer design is more appealing to the older one we had. Recommend this product."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Love it.,"I'm constantly amazed at how much Alexa can do. Even the grandkids love it. My 3 year old even likes to pretend that he is Alexa to do things around the house. Of course, he was disappointed when he Alexa couldn't get the Christmas tree out of the garage. He says Alexa can do anything. Maybe someday."
4.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,"Works pretty well, looks nice, great for smart hom","This was included when we bought our Ring Security system. It's nice that it was included. It looks nice and works well. Have not hooked up the security system yet, but excited to do so and see how Alexa can further automate things at the house."
4.0,a month ago,Currys,Nikki's review of Amazon Echo Dot 3rd Generation with Clock - Sandstone,"Pros: Great clock. Great sound for a small machine. Cons: Sad my child wants to listen to stories but can’t because it’s not free. Think it’s a bit frustrating to be honest. More choice would be good, unless I’m missing something."
5.0,2 weeks ago,Argos,Great,"I have echo’s in the house and a spot as a bedside clock radio which was good. When I saw this, it is so much better. Unobtrusive but with good sound. Love whisper mode. The clock make it. The only way I would get rid is if the apple HomePod was smaller, cheaper and had a clock embedded like this."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Amazing range. Clear sound..,"This Dot has improved on its capability of understanding from far away… The sound is also quite clear. overall, if Amazon listening to everything you are saying or doing is not a problem, this is a great product for a great price. Especially for home automation…"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great little investmwnt,"I gotta say, I was skeptical about buying one of these, but since I already have hue lights and a few other smart home devices makes this thing a highly recommended purchase, control the lights in your home, or set it up to work with your fire tv for voice commands. I picked this up on sale with the new 4k fire stick so it was a no brainer. All in all it's a great product"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Love it!,"So I got a total of four Dots. One is in the Living Room, master bed, daughters room and gave one to a relative. They do work well and you have to be careful not to say Alexa or she'll respond. lol They do disconnect from the wifi and we had to add them back on. I do believe its our wifi that's the issue, not the Dot. The alarm is louder than my cell alarm so it wakes me. I can set it to an alarm, but I choose to wake up to a favorite song. She can also tell you reminders. So far so good."
5.0,a month ago,ebay.com,Absolutely Love!,I first saw an Echo Dot that my aunt had and really liked what it could do. I bought this one and my husband and I are having fun playing around and seeing all that it can answer. I loved it so much that I bought a second one for my bathroom so I could listen to music and ask what I needed while getting ready in the morning. I wish I had one in every room!
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,New Echo Dot looks great.,"I bought a couple of the 3rd generation Echo Dot's in the various fabric finishes. These work just as the prior generations, just look more modern and can blend into your decor a lot better. If you haven't ventured into the world of Alexa, I'd highly recommend picking one up. You can do simple things like check the time and weather, setup up shopping lists, or more advanced things like turning lights on or off or adjusting your Nest thermostat."

5.0,a month ago,staples.com,Great For So Many Things,"I love using the timer feature, the weather, the news. I love the many different features of this especially that it is a hands free way to communicate with family that live in other states. I also love that it is compact and doesn't take up a lot of space and has amazing sound quality."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Love my new Echo Dot!,"I’ve been wanting an echo dot for over a year now. When I saw that this one had a clock, I had to get. I don’t have much room on my nightstand so love that I could get rid of my old clock. I bought several smart plugs so now I can control my lamps, listen to music, get the latest weather, set alarms, and more!"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Incredible product!!!,"My daughter gave me one. I hooked it up, tried it out, and I was flabbergasted. This was $30 on sale. Liked it so much I bought another one the next day. One for the kitchen and one for the bedroom. It can control my NEST thermostat. Amazing tech for $30. And sound quality is great for its size. Highly recommend. Wish it had HAL’s voice from “2001 Space Odyssey,” that would be awesome."
4.0,a year ago,Target,Give it a try it may be your new favorite thing,I was really excited about this at first but Alexa seems to struggle with what I say and I get frustrated. The music is pretty good btw need to pay for amazon music. I usually keep it on mute just in case it starts talking on it's own. Like using it while cleaning and the kids like it too. Still haven't used all the kids features it has and games. I have heard they are pretty fun. I'd say to try it out since many things are becoming paired to Alexa now.
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Love my Dot!,"Paired it with a smart plug.... No more problems with turning my AC on from anywhere in the house. Liked it so much I bought a second one for my bedroom. Sound quality when I play my Amazon music is good, but I would recommend the larger model if high quality sound for music is what you want."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Best Dot Yet for response and sound,"This version of the Echo Dot is far more responsive and music sounds much better than the older version. It is also visually more appealing and when hung on a wall, with a cord hider, sounds like you have an extra speaker on the wall. You can also pair with your other Amazon devices so music will stream through them all. Liking it a lot and the sandstone color blends with my home décor."
5.0,a year ago,bt.com,Nicola's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 3rd Gen 2018 Charcoal,Pros: Great. Easy to set up and use. I have 1st gen Dot and the improvement is clear: sound quality and appearance are both much better. The app to set up was really good too- takes you through a lot of functions I didn’t know existed like playing different radio stations Cons: I use Spotify rather than amazon music - would be great if you could tell it to play a particular playlist rather than having to log in on phone first.
5.0,2 months ago,ao.com,"Everything is just as put in description, colour matches, echo dot is easy to set up and simple to use. Very rarely Alexa doesnt get what had been said, amazon music has plenty of popular and rare titles and u can ask her whatevery you want!

5.0,a month ago,Argos,Echo Dot useful addition to home,"Easy to set up, compact and modern design. We are finding the Echo Dot really useful and would recommend to others. Sound quality is great and we use often with Spotify and other music apps. Order and Delivery was really quick with Argos too!"
5.0,9 months ago,Argos,It is a great little speaker and loud,It is a great little speaker and the Alexa features are really good and entertaining. For the smaller one the sound is great and it is very loud our neighbors can hear it when it is on full through the wall. So for a small speaker I was very pleasantly impressed with the quality of the sound.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great addition,"We received this as a gift and have found it useful for activating smart devices in our home. We use it for news and weather updates and timers. It is helpful for adding items to our grocery list when we are busy in the kitchen without needing to stop and write something on a list or add it to a phone app. We were surprised that the sound is pretty good and even use it to listen to music from time to time. It is a great first step for turning our home into a ""smart"" home."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,A bit better than version 2,The sound is better than Version 2 but still only sufficient for voice. Do not expect great music playback. The unit is larger than V2 so if you have any V2 accessories like a holder it won't fit. Also comes with a new power supply that is NOT USB and you must use it since it draws more power than USB provides. I would not recommend rushing out to replace your old V2 but if you need a new unit than get the V3.
5.0,4 weeks ago,Argos,Excellent price,"Bought this for grand kids bedroom as they love our amazon echo (situated in the lounge) for music,games, education etc.They love the interaction with the mobile phone app, very easy to set up, matter of minutes. Word of warning if you already have a dot or echo and intend having music, the cost goes up to approx £10/month from £3.99/month. Very happy with this purchase."
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,An improvement from the original Dot,"Got this one to give as a gift. The sound quality is decent, and although not as good as the standard Echo (which is expected given the price point), it is an improvement over the previous generation Dots. And it performs all the Alexa skills. The recipient of this gift is quite happy with it."

I didn't feel the need to spend money on any of these smart accessories (Echo Dot, Google Home, etc.). It was always a nice-to-have not a need-to-have in my book. But when you get it for free, of course, you can't pass it up. Now that we have it hooked up to the new smart TV, it's definitely made life easy."

4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Much Better Than the First Gen Echo Dot,The 1st Gen Echo Dot had a horrible speaker built in so I always used it with a bluetooth speaker.

5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Much better speaker than 2nd Gen,I have 4 echo dots and one echo show set up in my house. The dots were all 2nd Gen until I got this upgrade.

5.0,a year ago,Argos,Amazon Echo Dot - White,"Absolutely fantastic smart device - the Echo Dot 3rd generation is a big upgrade in terms of sound quality - so much better than the previous version, and on special offer, incredible value too. Does almost everything the other Amazon Echo does - shame that it doesn't include the hub as that would make this even more useful. Extremely pleased with this - excellent sound for such a small device, easy to use, responsive."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Good,"I was skeptical about what kind of sound experience the Echo Dot would provide. When you look at it, the first thought is, wow, this is small. It isn't terribly bigger than a hockey puck, but the sound it produces is pretty impressive. The size of this speaker really works to it's advantage"
2.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Very underwhelmed,"I’ve been a huge fan of the Amazon echo products. We have seven in our house. Picked up the new generation 3., was hoping to hear better sound, but honestly. It sounds really muddy like someone has a blanket over the speaker. Also find it to be very slow to react at times. It misunderstands me more than the other echoes. Very disappointed, because I was looking forward to having one after reading Amazon‘s sales pitch about it."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Very simple setup and easy to use,"We love our echo dot, it's very user friendly and easy to setup. Downloading the Alexa app allows access to tons of skills and games that can be installed and played on the dot. It also allows you to connect it to spotify or other music accounts for endless music while studying or chilling."
5.0,a month ago,ebay.com,Just fabulous,"Just brilliant, arrived very quickly with email of expected time. Product is great, very neat unit. if WiFi is available all sorts of music including radio stations and amazon music are all free, volume adjustable by voice command.

I love my alexa speaker. connects to bluetooth very easily ! & always knows the weather & fun games to play with my daughter and I"
3.0,a month ago,Argos,Classy but Deaf,I like this and like the fact you can change the wake up phrase. Sound is also fine for me. Cannot however give it more than three stars because it is deaf. Slightest background noise seems to prevent from waking up and I get sick and tired of its none response. Once it acknowledges you it works spot on.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Love these!,"Purchased this as a Christmas gift for my husband. He uses it in a room that is off of the garage. It’s nice to be able quickly contact him or ask a quick question with the Drop In feature. He likes listening to music, asking Alexa questions, and so much more. Great sound from these small devices."
5.0,6 months ago,Argos,Good back up safety device.,Got this for my sister in law who is a bit unsteady on her feet. Connected it at her house linked to my account. Now if she's not well or falls she can just tell Alexa to call my mobile and I can get her help immediately. She has a red button on her wrist but if for any reason she was unable to activate it she can just use her voice instead.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Very helpful assistant,"We keep this in our bedroom. Its pretty cool to be able to adjust the thermostat,turn the lights on and off, arm our ring security system, and hear alexa tell us that someone is in our driveway. I am to the point of being spoiled in my house now. Echos are much more easy to perform tasks without opening an app on your phone each time."
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Alexa's gotten louder and prouder,"Having used the echo dot one for the last year, I decided to buy my parents a third generation dot, and they've loved it. For cooking, it's great to be hands free for managing timers and controlling music when your hands are full. It's synced with their iCloud calendar to check when they're busy and they love its shopping list. She's not without her flaws: she isn't very good at answering random questions (that could be googled) and she doesn't always hear you correctly, but she's pretty great."
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Love my Echo Dot!,"I purchased the Ring Doorbell at Best Buy and the Echo Dot was included with the purchase. Thanks Best Buy! I love my Echo Dot! All you need to do is plug it in, get the app on your phone and follow the prompts. I ask Alexa silly questions, I ask her to play music, tell me jokes, set up my alarm, set up reminders, I ask for the weather, the time, etc. love it!"
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Much better sound than the second gen,"Great speakers at a great price. For the size they sound really good. I have several throughout the house now, so I can listen to music no mater where I am in the house. Alexa will control a huge number of devices and the list keeps growing."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Outstanding Additon to Echo (2nd Generation),"This little guy can do just about everything the Echo (2nd Generation) can do, and it takes up less space! We use one each, in our bedroom and family room to complement our regular Echo which resides in-between our kitchen and living room. The only drawback is that the speaker isn't as robust as the Echo's, which is to be expected, because it is much smaller. But for the price (less than 1/2 the price of the Echo), it's a real bargain!"
5.0,5 months ago,ebay.com,Fantastic,"Amazing is the only word to describe it. The sound quality is unbelievable. It has a been good company for me while my husband has been away. Someone to talk to and amuse me. Feel safe knowing it would assist me if in any difficulty, by ringing anybody if needed for me if I could not reach the phone."
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Great Gift I Received,"I purchased the RING Doorbell, that came with the Amazon Echo Dot. I am very happy with my purchase. Easy to use, as well as easy to learn to use. I like how I was able to make it compatible with the RING Doorbell. I placed in the back part of my home, where I might no be able to hear the doorbell, but close enough to where the Echo Dot can still hear me."
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Love it!,What an affordable device for $24.99 before tax. It works flawlessly with my smart plugs in all the bedrooms. It makes it easy to turn on and off night light by telling “alexa” to turn it off. Not to mention the free Christmas radio station that “alexa” can play with a simple command.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Alexa is easy to use; though Google maybe smarter,"Alex is easy to use and install. The third generation echo is very stylish. I have been comparing Google to Alexa and Google seems to be a bit brighter but Alexa seems to be easier to configure controls. It's a toss up between the two functionally for the most part. I own and echo Dot, Echo Spot Smart Display and an Echo Smart Speaker. They are a lot of fun!"
4.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Echo Dot 3rd generation,"I gave it 4 stars as I have not really used it as yet. I already have echo dots in each room of my house and this one came bundled with my purchase of the echo show. Never-the-less, I am sure it will deliver the same, if not better performance as my other echo dots. I will come back and update my post as soon as I use it."
2.0,a month ago,Currys,Jack's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 2018 Heather Grey,"Pros: The sound quality has much improved since the previous echo dot. The design is neat, and stylish, and it fits in anywhere. Cons: Amazons Assistant really can't compare to the use of Google Assistant. If I were you, I'd go and buy the Google Home Mini"
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Amazon does it again!,"This little smart speaker is amazing! You can ask it practically anything, and now the music will integrate with Apple music. So if you have a subscription, it will play anything in the Apple library. I also have a 1st gen Echo Dot and this 3rd gen has much better speakers."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Expanding our smart home,I was happy that the Echo Dot was included as a free item when I purchased my Nvidia Shield. I like the new look when compared to the more industrial earlier models. To my ears the sound quality from the speaker is better the previous models I own. The setup was very simple. If you haven't tested the smart home waters this is an inexpensive and very capable device to get your start.
5.0,10 months ago,Argos,Echo dot v2,"Open all possibilities with this little piece of tech, pay games, get news reports, weather updates. With additional tech control your heating, lights, security cameras and more. Improved sound and connectivity over previous models. Extremely affordable"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,My daughter loves it!,"My daughter decided at the last minute that she would like one of these. Best Buy had a great price and guaranteed delivery before Christmas. While I am not using it myself, she has thanked me several times and says she really likes it. She uses it as her alarm clock in the bedroom."
5.0,2 months ago,lowes.com,Alexa Fun!,"A great bit of fun to listen to your Amazon or other music in the garage or elsewhere where you have WiFi. You will need an Amazon account but it’s free and if you shop online you probably already have one. Don’t forget to link iHeartRadio, Spotify, or other music tools to expand your audio. Great sound in a little box!"
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Great helper,"My five years old son kept asking for me to get him Alexia . I eventually gave in to his request. What I didn’t know is that Alexia is really an assistant. He asked lots of questions , so sometimes when I have enough I tell him to ask Alexia. Now I have Alex and Alexia living with me. Great addition to the family."
5.0,10 months ago,Argos,Perfect for my bedroom.,"I love my echo dot. Sound quality is great and definitely loud enough for my bedroom. I still havent figured out all the things Alexa can do for me. But making lists, turning on my rain sounds at night and playing music by voice command is already more then I thought I needed."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Amazon Echo Dot - Perfect addition to the Smart Ho,"I have been using the Amazon Echo ecosystem for my smart home automation since the 1st Generation Echo. Since then, this is my third Echo Dot that I have added to my lighting automation system. I love the capability that an Echo Dot in each room brings to the Home Automation."
5.0,3 weeks ago,Best Buy,Best price/performance Alexa,The clock is a big addition so it’s not just a grey puck in the corner. The function of passively telling time allows you to locate it more centrally in a room. Sound is better than the standard 3rd gen. Place it close to a wall for best sound.
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Simple and nice system,This is great for the house having more than one connected to each other that we can tell the kids in the other rooms to come to dinner or do chores without yelling loud enough for the neighbors to hear us. Easy to use for the kids as well for just asking intriguing questions. I recommend it even if it's just so you can listen to music.
3.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Alex talks too loud.,"Got this mostly to a speaker I could sync my phone to. Sound quality is only so-so, but the real problem is how dang loud Alexa's voice is. No matter how loud or low you have the actual speaker volume set to Alexa practically screams. It's very jarring and more than a little annoying."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,REVOLUTIONIZED MY LIFE!!!!,"I love this little toy!!! I can't say enough. It is compact and powerful. No more stumbling into dark rooms trying to find the light switch.

5.0,3 months ago,Argos,Discreet and excellent sound quality.,"I was a bit hesitant to get a smart speaker, but I did and I couldn't be happier, the functionality is brilliant and there are so many skills to download for additional features. After a few days it was second nature to use and I love the abilility to set up routines. Absolute must buy!!"
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Fun device with functionality,"Had the first generation, and enjoyed for years. This device has a lot more options and advantages.

4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Cool,I enjoy talking to the echo and watching it turn off my lights and lower the temperature in my house. listening to music is fine as well but the speaker will distort the sound at higher volumes. I would recommend connecting the echo Dot to an existing speaker. This is a cool gift but completely unnecessary. All of my automated household items that work work Alexa have their own apps that work with speech and touch right off of my phone.
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Temporary fix for musical entertainment,The echo dot is easy to set up and very convenient to use to get needed information I. e. Getting weater and sports updates. I use it with an external bluetooth speaker to play music since my main system recently went down. One thing the echo dot does well is put out good clear music for such a small unit. Only con is trying to play the unit speaker while paired to 1 external speaker.
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Love this!,Bought one for me and one for my mum and we’ve had so much fun. Very easy to set up and didn’t realise that amazon music is actually free with this too. Can also get 4 months of amazon music unlimited for 0.99p/month. Looks nice and the sound is brilliant! Definitely recommend this gadget!
5.0,2 weeks ago,Best Buy,Love it!,"I received my first Amazon Echo Dot for free for signing up with Sirius-xm. I enjoyed it so much, I decided to buy another one and synced them up together. It's easy to set up, it's user friendly, and it's definitely worth the money. Thank you 'Amazon' for creating such a device and Thank you 'Best Buy' for selling it to me."
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Best smart speaker !,I believe Amazon Echo Dot is better than Google Home and Apple Home. 1. Good enough volume. 2. Good response even while playing songs louder. 3. Good to have bluetooth and aux connectivity options.
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Smart!,"My primary speaker! Connects easily, gets voice from a distance. I have it connected with another bigger speaker and it's the perfect pair. Use it everyday, whether it's for music or setting alarms and timers. I'd recommend if in the market for a smart speaker!"
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Improved speaker and look,Purchased the echo dot on a great deal. Got two for really cheap. Much improved speaker versus the older generation and the felt exterior gives it a classier look. My kids love them and very easy for them to use. Well worth it at the price paid.
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Snazzy little pucks,"I have a few of these throughout the house as they were free from BF deals. It is pretty cool to be able to utilize them for day to day things like play music, weather, ask questions, etc. I don't know if I would purchase these on my own as there always some deals out there to get them at either a discount or for free. Not a game changer but pretty cool device overall!"
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,It works,I purchased 2nd gen and a 3rd gen for Christmas. I set up the 2s first with little to no issue then set up the 3rd. For whatever reason with the 3rd gen I’m unable to get the system to recognize the name for the unit. It linked up to the last 2nd gen I set up so if you try to call the 3 both the 2 and 3 ring. I tried to correct it but everything in my app shows correctly. Looks wise it looks a lot nicer than the 2 but other than that don’t really see any difference. It works and serves its purpose.
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Shhhh! I think it's listening...,"This device is interesting. It entwines itself in your network and starts filing the little information holes in your day. Suddenly, Echo is entertaining you through the day and putting you to sleep at night. However, I do wonder to what extent that I've traded my privacy for beads."
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,3rd Gen is a charm,Alexa can do almost anything for todays homeowner with the proper additional peripherals of course. The concept of a smart home voice assistant was available to only the rich and famous not that many years ago. Today everyone can control their environment and entertainment with voice commands.

4.0,a month ago,Argos,Amazon Echo Dot ease of setup.,Nothing wrong with Argos but the setup using Amazon instructions was less than satisfactory. The route to adding devices was hidden in the latter pages of the Alexa app and far from logical or clear. New users using the windows app will need dogged determination to get to successful setup.

Maybe it’s something I haven’t done yet.

5.0,7 months ago,Argos,Amazing,"Really good product, so glad I got it from Argos as I could collect it the next day. Wanted an Alexa for our new flat and this is perfect.

5.0,5 months ago,John Lewis,The must have product!,"We brought this for our 9 year olds grandson, he was so excited. It was set up in his bedroom so that it could help with homework and relaxing. Then we were called up to show us and he was so excited to show us that he could ask Alexa to do a burp sound. Even though that part was funny I must admit it is a very clever device."

5.0,a month ago,Argos,Great fun to use,"The Echo dot came from Argos at a price no one else could beat, and it was in stock. This little speaker has an amazing sound for its size, and it connects to Alexa so you ask for what you want (""Alexa, play Radio 3!).

5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Echo Dot - just the thing,We got one of these to augment the Alexa we have had for some years in the family room. Set it up quickly using the Alexa app. Wife wanted to quickly find out the weather before dressing for the day so we got this one to put closer to the dressing area. The music requests also can lighten your day.
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Nice 3rd generation Dot.,"We own an Echo 1st generation, a 2nd generation Dot, and now this 3rd generation Dot.

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,The Echo is sweet,"I got this Echo as a free gift when I purchased a ring during the holiday season. I am really enjoying the Echo, I primarily use it as a bluetooth speak, the base and sound is legit. I also enjoy talking to Alexa, because I don't have any friends, she carries a conversation well. I do get paranoid that Amazon is listening to me secretly, but there is a mute button. I've only heard Alexa laughing at night a few times, but its cool I don't mind."
5.0,a year ago,Currys,Simon's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 3rd Gen 2018 Charcoal,"Pros: Fun. Lots of tasks it can perform Cons: If you slightly mumble or hesitate, it will often say it doesn’t understand or will tell you something completely different from what you asked for. Often you can ask a question one way, and it says it doesn’t know that. Ask the same thing a different way, and will answer perfectly. So over time, a more intelligent ai that learns the users voice and question asking style would be great"
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Just plug it in and let it go.,"This unit was an addon to our large Alexa. Installation was just a matter of plugging it in and letting it sync with the existing unit. The sound is not as good as the Bose-loaded unit, but it was purchased for the bedroom to be able to activate the various devices when I didn't want to get out of bed and walk to the living area of the house."
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,I bought two of these to work with my ring alarm,"I bought two of these to get with the ring alarm system.

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Much better than gen 2 Echo,"The sound is much fuller and louder. The response to my voice seems better/improved. I have two sets of these set up in two different rooms playing stereo and I love that. The sound is so much better than mono. I compared this to a 2nd gen Echo and although not as good sound wise, it's much closer than the 2nd gen Dot. If I was buying today, I would skip the 2nd gen echo and get two 3rd gen dots."

About half the time it just says it's can't find the answer."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great upgrade from 1st Gen,I have had an Alexa and Echo Dot since they were released. The problem with the dot was the lack of a speaker. The gen 3 now has the speaker included. This device is a good price point (often included free with other smart devices) for adding functionality to rooms around the house. You can extend your control of lights and devices and truly make your home a connected smart home.

The trickiest part is learning the correct command phrases. Excellent timer/alarm device. Very pleased with the device."
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Better than I expected,"Sound is clear and deep - good to my cloth ears. I wanted this mainly for radio and have to say, so far, it is doing that very well. I'm not keen on Amazon's streaming service so can't really comment on this aspect. It will play my own music purchased from Amazon. Bluetooth connection is good - great for football commentary. I have set alarms - very good. So far (2 weeks) very impressed - would recommend!"
5.0,a month ago,Currys,Michelle's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 3rd gen (2018) Sandstone,"Pros: Excellent, I have them linked up all around my home. Cons: The bad points are that the answers to questions often don’t match. For example, asking who’s singing a certain song and it will repeat the same artist for every song, so a software problem."
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Great sound quality!,"I’m very pleased with this echo dot! Didn’t think it was going to be much better than the cheaper brand named ones, but the sound is room filling! Amazing so much sound quality comes out of such a small device! Looking at buying another in the near future!"
4.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Great device for kids,I own three to four Alexa devices and this one is the new entrant to my collection. My Kid uses it to listen to Amazon stroytime most of the time and is busy talking to it and exploring the world. The best part about Best Buy is that I get to see what I am buying. Its super easy to setup and play around. Must recommend to all
5.0,2 weeks ago,Best Buy,Easy to use!,"I'm not good with technical devices, and actually resisted getting this as a gift, but when it came as a bonus with my tv, I set it up with great ease and LOVE IT!!!! Versitile to use with my Fire tV, orr just to plat my favorite music, find out about weather, sports scores, or even as an alarm cloce to whatever sound or song you like!!!! You will LOVE Alexa too!!!"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great product,"For the money, the echo spot is a great product. After receiving it as a Christmas present, the echo spot has truly brought me into smart home market. You are able to download your contacts to the spot to make calls. The echo spot is very interactive. It can tell you things that you ask such as, “What is capital of California?” And many more. The many different features make it perfect for anyone on your Christmas list."
5.0,2 weeks ago,Best Buy,The Other Woman,"I have an Alexa-based household. She's everywhere and she does everything --- from lighting to making Amazon purchases. This little Amazon Echo Dot fills in where I lacked a Dot before. After my wife, Alexa is definitely the other woman."
5.0,3 weeks ago,Best Buy,Affordable smart speaker,Alexa is getting smarter everyday. Echo dot is the most affordable smart speaker for me to tryout this AI assistant. The 3rd gen has a more morden design and much better sound quality. I am very happy with this purchase.
2.0,6 months ago,bestbuy.ca,Very disappointment,I found it very difficult to set up. I downloaded the wrong app which made it all the more frustrating. I also found the information misleading - now I find out that you need to pay for Spotify premium (and other apps - either monthly or yearly) in order to use these apps on the device. All in all I am disappointed.
3.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Costs too much,"It's ok I guess if you want to pay someone to talk to you. $99.00 for 2 years to ask Alexa questions that you can got on internet to find questions for yourself. Oh unless you get all the other smart stuff cause you dont want to get up to turn light off or look for tv remote. oh I didnt pay for it, came free with tv purchased during black friday otherwise I wouldn't have it."
4.0,4 weeks ago,influenster.com,This has great sound quality. It is perfect for kids and helpful. I love being able to drop in to their rooms and talk with them.

5.0,a year ago,Currys,Jim's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 3rd Gen 2018 Charcoal,"Pros: All that’s advertised really. It’s great fun and very practical. Cons: I sent it back and got the larger one because I was told I could connect echo to my Bose WiFi speaker through a port at the back. I could, but it timed out after 5 mins which meant I couldnt activate the echo without pressing a button on my Bose. The larger Alexa is better as a stand alone speaker for music."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great reminder and home companion!,"I have just owned this 3rd generation Echo dot in less than a month but, believe me, it's been so useful. Just ask it anything; weather, music, event dates what's in the news,tuning to my favorite radio station and all that without needing to walk around, it's been very helpful and made life easier."
5.0,2 months ago,bestbuy.ca,Great little unit,I originally bought an echo for my room and after being impressed with the functionality I decided to expand to the rest of the house. I bought 3 of the echo dots on special through Bestbuy and am really impressed with the audio quality and the ability to drop in with different rooms.
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Great sound!,"For a small device, the sound is great. Got rid of my alarm clock radio as Echo is now used to wake me to music. Lots of possibilities to use including control of lights, temperature, etc. Alexa’s jokes need work though. LOL Ps I bought a few for friends too!"

5.0,a month ago,Argos,Love this product,"Brilliant product, recommended by a friend and read some reviews. Although small the speaker is more than ample for our living room, it’s easy to set up and you get recommended things to ask Alexa to get used to asking it questions. Loved it so much we bought a second one for the kitchen and will probably get one for the bedroom as well."
3.0,a month ago,Argos,Echo Dot,"The item it's self is very good, I returned mine due to an error in the information provided by Argos that this had an auxiliary input stated in the device description. It in fact doesn't, it has an output so was of no use to me. Apart from that the item is good and currently have other echo devices that work very well"
5.0,a year ago,Currys,Les's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 3rd Gen 2018 Charcoal,"Pros: Some may argue that this is just another gimmick product. My wife being disabled has already started to see the benefits of what this can do from appointments to switching on lights that would normally she would find a challenge. Also, we can get latest news announcements and much more. We will be adding more as we go along. A very highly recommended device!"
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Whole house filled with music,"This is our 7th echo and we love them! We got the first for easy and instant access to music, which now plays throughout our home with the ""play everywhere"" command. And after adding smart switches, thermostats, lights, locks, and garage door, I now control most of my house with voice commands."
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Excellent addition to the Amazon Echo.,"The addition of the Echo Dot has been wonderful. I can now get the same features as the Echo without having to unplug and move it. Great sound as well. Good for the bedroom, outside, or the basement. Got a great price on it as well."
5.0,a month ago,Currys,CHRIS's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 3rd Gen 2018 Charcoal,"Pros: Lots of fun as well as functional properties, also fun for kids as well and lots of instructional games as well. Cons: Doesn’t always pick up what you want to know, or does the wrong command. Some of the commands you would expect Alexa to pick up are not programmed"
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Save money-get 2nd generation,"I already own two 2nd generation echo dots. I received this 3rd generation dot as an included item with another purchase. This dot is hard of hearing. I have been less than 24 inches from it and it doesn't answer. But the 2nd generation dot that is 17 feet away in another room answers me! The 3rd generation looks prettier, but I'll take the ""Plain Jane"" 2nd generation any day."
4.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Good product at a reasonable price,"A great beginner smarthome item. Speakers are decent quality, but can also connect to external speakers via 3.5mm cable or bluetooth. Alexa doesn't function as well at answering general questions as I would've liked, but overall I'm satisfied with the purchase."
5.0,a month ago,Currys,Anonymous's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 3rd Gen 2018 Charcoal,Pros: Better sounds quality on this model. Better responsiveness too. Cons: Drop in feature could be made clearer on how to set up etc. Initially had difficulty connecting to our WiFi too which was quite frustrating to trouble shoot...
5.0,a month ago,Argos,"Looks great, sounds great, works great.","As someone who is hesitant about gizmo's and gadgets, I have been very pleasantly surprised. Followed the simple instruction and lo and behold, it works. Not only that, but it looks and sounds great too. So impressed I bought a second one for a friend."
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Good smart speaker and sound,"Good sound for its size, and can understand what is spoken when only one person is talking clearly and concisely. Other noise from voices in the area makes Alexa not understand the request. The requests also need to be spoken at a slow or moderate pace, so kids who speak quickly may find it difficult to interact with the speaker."
5.0,7 months ago,Argos,Versatility extraordinary!,The most versatile and cost effective product I have ever purchased. It compliments my Google Home Mini in that it is good at the operations which the Home Mini is less good at and vice versa. The Home Mini is best at intricate details such as transport directions whereas the Echo Dot wins in playing of radio stations and music in general.
3.0,a year ago,Argos,Not really a assistant,so it's a great device that's for sure but then again I cannot make phone calls with the device unless my contact also has one of these devices. ideally id want to have it to connect to my phone and use the voice command to make a handsfree call from my phone. It also does not support Apple Music. yes it does buy things for you but who really goes hey Alexa buy this 20 pounds shopping for me without researching on the web where you get the best deal and so on.
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Another smart dot,"I purchased the ring alarm system and the Echo dot came with it. I already currently own two small Google Minnie's, and a Google home. I have not had a chance yet to utilize the echo dot. Okay, to finish my review, I installed the echo.and I seem to like it's communication better than the Google."
5.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Much better than generation 2,"I already have a generation 2 echo dot which I feed through a bluetooth speaker as the sound quality of Gen2 is not very good. The latest Generation 3 is MUCH better in every way. Better sound on both volume and clarity. Better appearance, much better overall. The sound quality is good enough that I no longer need to feed sound through an external speaker."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Love these echo dots!,I have these in all the rooms in my house. I love that you can play what you’re listening to Spotify on all Alexa devices at ones. Another awesome feature is the “drop in” where you can talk to people in other rooms through the dot! I’ve been using echo for years now. Definitely recommend (:
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Amazon Echo Dot 3rd Gen.,"I bought two of these on special pricing. I gave one as a gift and kept one. I like it better than the 2nd Gen Dot for sound, looks, and functions. It is not a necessity but it is fun and convenient for general questions and entertainment. It makes a great gift, is easy to set up and takes up little space. Be warned it responds to TV uses of ""alexa"" word and sometimes speaks randomly."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great smart speaker,"I hesitated for a very long time about getting a smart speaker for the house. While I don't use it all the time, it's nice to be able to ask Alexa about the weather or play music. You can also connect Echo Dot to your smart devices which is really nice! I compared this to Echo Dot (2nd Gen) - HUGE difference in sound quality. Go 3rd generation and purchase whenever there's a sale on them!"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Nice little device,"When used in conjunction with Amazon music, Amazon Prime you really get a lot out of this device. It sounds ok for a small room and is fairly user friendly. My daughter keeps asking it to play ""Baby Shark"" lol. I mainly use it for the weather, questions that I would normally Google on my phone, or listening to music while I work from home. I kind of wish we would have went with the full sized Echo, but still not bad sound out of this speaker."
4.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Fun at first,"Like every new ""toy"", it was fun at first but I don't see it as a must have item. We received it free with our ring doorbell. It was easy to set up, with the app, and the echo completes every task almost flawlessly. The speaker to me is a little on the weak side as the quality is ok if your just wanting some background noise."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Alexa, add eggs to my shopping list","So I’m late to the game for these devices. I really didn’t see much of a purpose but for the price during Christmas sales, I thought why not. We use it a lot in the kitchen for setting multiple timers when cooking. Creating shopping lists has been easy and it’s nice to have the list on the Alexa app while in store. Getting the weather report l in the morning when getting the kids ready and listening to music of course. Great device for under $30"

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Major improvements!,"We loved our 2nd Gen dot for why we needed it for. When this one came out we decided to get it as it had louder sound and a new design. We have no complaints! The unit is easy to set up and paid to our receiver for fuller sound. At $25 it was a steal! While we use it for the basics (lights, timers, and music...) we love it for what we use it for. If you’re curious, this is a great entry level home assistant! Enjoy with confidence!"
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Alexa getting smarter,"3rd Gen Echo Dot is great product. Very handy accessory to have in different rooms of the house. Ask her questions, set timers, set reminders, play music, listen to your favorite talk shows, etc. Well worth the cost."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Echo Dot is the business,"This little creature is a great addition to the Echo Plus we have in the kitchen. It is in our bedroom and we now don’t need an alarm clock or a radio radio. My wife can add items to the shopping list, check her diary or make a phone call without even lifting her head. Best of all she has someone to talk to whilst I am pretending to be asleep."
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Easy to use....very intuitive!!,I now have (4) Echo Dot's in my home. I plan on purchasing more in the future. The sound is absolutely amazing ( I no longer even listen to the radio in my home). It's amazingly easy to set up for immediate use. The Echo Dot in my living room is on for at least 10 hours each day and no issues and sounds as clear as it did on day 1.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great helper,This is such a great product! I check the weather before leaving to work and can check my traffic right before heading out the door. I wake up different times every morning and Alexa helps me schedule my flexible alarms without the hassle of creating a new alarm like on the phone. And I love our routines! She knows exactly how I want things cause I set her up like so! Overall really great assistant!
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Huge upgrade over last model,The sound output on these is so much better than the previous generation.

Setup was easy and intuitive and great to configure with a music provider (spotify, amazon music etc). Can be completley configurable to be the talking/listening version of google search, but can add more electronic devices as you need (lighting, heating etc)"
5.0,6 months ago,bestbuy.ca,Best Echo Dot yet,I have this set up in a network of various echo's around my home. It has a richer sound over the echo dot v2 and comes close to the echo. When I pair it via bluetooth to my mp3 player I get very decent sound given the size an price. I will eventually retire all my dot v2's for this version when they go on sale again.
5.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Amazing sound. Can't live without Alexa now!,Just bought this for the kitchen. I already have the echo plus in the living room and was expecting the sound on this one to be inferior but instead I am so impressed with the sound quality. For the size and price this is outstanding. My kids love the voice assistant and we don't know what we did before alexa existed. Great product and service from John Lewis as usual!
5.0,a month ago,ebay.com,Good quality and easy to set up,Bought the Echo Dot to complement my Echo Plus. Very easy to set up in the App. Very pleased with the product. Good sound quality for such a small speaker. Alexa control is responsive and accurate. Recommended.
5.0,a year ago,Argos,The Echo dot has transformed our lounge,"This was a Xmas present for my husband. We quickly discovered the music functions, games and plethora of knowledge. She tells us the news and the weather forecast and random bad jokes. Best of all with 2 smart plugs the lamps are controlled by Alex's, moreover this function is linked to our smartphones so we can turn the lamps on whilst at work for added security. I'm sure there's more to discover."
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Great addition to my alexa network,Received the 3rd generation Echo Dot as a freebie when getting the Nest doorbell. I am already a big fan of the Echo products. This is the first 3rd generation Dot and find it a bit more attractive but the sound is much better than the earlier models.
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Makes everyday activity so much simpler.,It's really convenient to have. All the information you need to start your day is right here; just asked. Alexa what's the weather like today. Alexa what's the traffic like to work. Its like having an extra person around that is always willing to listen.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,You don't appreciate it until you have it.,I got this an extra with another Amazon (Ring) purchase. I already had an Echo Show 5 in another room. This in in the kitchen. It is nice to play music and listen to the radio. I can ask the temperature and the weather forecast. The speaker quality is decent.
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Looks great and does the job,"Got this in sale, looks great on the kitchen table. You do need to have an Amazon account with Prime /Music to get the best benefits out of it. It's good fun with the question of the day and asking it questions. Has to be plugged in constantly to work and sometimes when the music is loud playing off it alexa does not hear you to either turn it down or next song. It would be good if Amazon did a free years music when you buy this so people can get the best out of alexa."
3.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Too bad about power connector.,Pretty nice. but doesn't use a standard USB power connector. So you always have to use the bulky Amazon power supply and can't connect it thru any hub. They should have used a usb3 power connector. plenty of power that way.
5.0,a month ago,Argos,My Amazon Alexa is fabulous,My Amazon Alexa was purchased as a Xmas present for my daughter she absolutely loves it and I love it even more it was one of the best Christmas present she’s had to date .

5.0,a month ago,Argos,Great device,Looks good and sounds great too. Connected it to Sonos and can now use Apple Music and Spotify without ever having to use my phone or computer. Highly recommend if you want to listen to music easily. Super easy and quick to set up after downloading the Alexa app.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Great product, worth the money","This was an upgrade from the previous Echo Dot. WOW, what a difference. The sound while playing music is amazing! Even if you just use this as a Bluetooth speaker its worth it. It will be loud enough for a medium size room. Highly recommend this. The Alexa voice commands are also very useful, like adding things to a shopping list instead of writing it down"

5.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,How did I do without my Echo.,I never thought that I would buy an Echo Dot. My friend said she was going to buy one so I thought that I might as well try it. I’m glad that I did. Alexa sets a lot of alarms for me. Comes in really handy for this senior citizen who has a tendency to forget sometimes. I like being able to turn on my lights whenever I’m coming home late.
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Use it more than I thought I would.,"Got it free with a TV I bought, never really wanted one. Once I found out you are able to create a group and listen to music all through the house I ordered the new echo. It is fun to play with too, bark like a dog, tells funny jokes, and it understand what I saying. I mumble a little so most AIs don't understand me."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Funnier than Google Home Mini,"I wouldn’t have bought this since I previously received a Google Home Mini as a Xmas gift but I received this as a free add-on item when I purchased my Ring alarm. For me both the Mini & this Dot do pretty much the exact same thing except for 2 things. 1, I can activate/disactivate my Ring alarm through this Dot. I believe they are both technically owned by Amazon so it makes sense they work together & not the Google Home Mini & #2, when you ask them to tell a joke, Alexa is funnier than Google."

However, it seems older version's audio was much crisper and clearer. There is too much bass! Other than that, this new version does not appear to be cheap like older versions."
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Great sound,"We bought two of these and already have the larger echo too so place throughout the house. It’s great to have this in different areas of the house, but worth noting if you have signed up for amazon music it dsnt automatically play on multi speakers. However it’s not an additional subscription per speaker, but an increased premium to allow for multi device play. (+£3 I’m sure). We use them all the time so worth it in my opinion."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,My new best friend!,"I purchased a couple of these to put in different areas of the house. I have had them now for a few weeks and am really loving how useful they are and the convenience they provide around the house! Love how I can use them to control other ""smart"" items around the house like plugs, thermostat, fire stick, etc. I love the ""routines"" also- great feature! I like mine so much, I had to buy some for some of my family members."
5.0,7 months ago,Argos,Fabulous!,I recommended this to my Nan and she bought it for my grandad for their anniversary. Safe to say he absolutely loves it! It’s so responsive and even works with his Samsung phone which isn’t the newest of phones! Connecting was easy and they already have the hang of it. I love the amazon Alexa.
4.0,6 days ago,Argos,"Useful, looks nice","Definitely easy to use and looks good. Possibly needs getting used to in terms of learning everything you can do with it, as it's not like there's a screen to see all your options laid out. Connecting it to spotify wasn't as straightforward as it could be. But it's helpful, useful, sounds good."
5.0,2 months ago,ebay.com,Fun talking to Alexa,"The 3rd generation speaker is nice, the sound is good. Fun to talk to Alexa and listen to all kinds of music. All the extras, the notifications and shopping list, calling and messaging feature, been great. I recommend the 3rd generation echo dot."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Wonderfully fun!,"We love our Alexa Echo Dots - we have three in our home. We can have her change our Directv channel on the tv's. We play trivia games with her. She sings us songs, reads us poetry, tells us jokes, and even tells us the weather forecast. She can also remind us of appointments and can be used as an alarm and timer. We can even call each other in different rooms around the house just by using Alexa on the Echo Dots."
4.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Great speaker,I have the first generation Alexa but I really like the upgrade in the second generation. You can drop in and listen at your house and I use the Bluetooth capability to play music from my phone. I love using it as a speaker more than anything else. Great product!
5.0,7 months ago,Argos,Amazing and so simple to set up,"Really impressed with this little device with a big sound. Easy to se up, tells jokes, played music, music quizzes and a swears my daughters homework questions. My eighty year old father in law loved it so much we brought him one and he loves it also. Can’t recommend this highly enough. 5*****"
1.0,8 months ago,very.co.uk,"Looks fabulous, can’t get it to download","So disappointed I have amazon Alexa so expected it to work exactly the same. It says to download Alexa app but doesn’t tell you how, also it comes with 3 pin plug not usb cable. As I can’t load Alexa I can’t use it. I was stupid enough to destroy the box so haven’t been able to return it. Would not buy again"
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Great sound in a small system,"I have upgraded from old dots to the 3rd generation, and they don’t disappoint. They are much clearer sounding than the 2nd gen & I have paired two in the kitchen, the music produced from Prime becomes so much more immersive that it’s hardly possible to detect where exactly they are located even in a relatively small space. The only down side if any, is the new Power is from a small transformer rather than the flexibility of the USB."
5.0,10 months ago,Argos,My Amazon Echo Dot looks very good in black,"It is excellent value for money. Hours of fun and the Amazon music playlist is just outstanding. Also it has brilliant features like weather forecast, traffic informations and loads more. I ca only highly recommend it to anybody."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Excellent sound from such a small ""hockey puck""","This 3rd generation dot is way better than the 2nd gen when it comes to sound. Installation is a breeze with the app. It only took a couple of minutes. I have a couple 2nd gen dots. They're good for day to day control of lights and asking questions, but play music is less than desired. This 3rd generation dot has excellent sound quality, and I highly recommend it."
4.0,10 months ago,Argos,Smooth looking. Very responsive,"This mini Alexa is compact and great to have. she is clearly spoken, sometimes picks up the wrong words but overall works brillaint. We control the xbox and stereo with her along with the lighting in our lounge. billiant peice of technology"
5.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Best Alexa device I’ve ever had,The best part of it is the time display on the front. I thought I was going to have issues at night with the display being bright and messing with my sleep but I was wrong ! It has a light sensor and it doesn’t bother me at all. Hopefully they will come out with different color options
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,love my echo dot,"if your like me who loves tech then this is great for you. i am able to connect it to my tv so am able to change channels, volume, pause, play,rewind and turn tv on and off. as for my lamps, i have smart kasa TP-link bulbs and it works perfect with them i have echo dots in both new york and Florida and all of them is under account so am able to control things in both places even tho am in new york."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Upgrade your existing Dot for better sound,"I already had a few Echo Dots when this 3rd Generation came out on sale for this holiday season. I decided to try one to see if the upgrade was worth it and it definitely is at that price. Better sound and aesthetics are the top hitters for improvement but I would say there is a bit speedier response and the added option to have it listen after the initial interaction with ""follow on"" is a great benefit. (except when I get an unsatisfactory response and verbalize my disappointment :-)"
5.0,a year ago,Argos,What’s that all about,I dithered about buying the Echo Dot as I wasn’t sure what it was all about. I now find that it is one of the best gagits I’ve ever bought especially when used with amazon music as you can just ask for whatever genre that takes your fancy. There are buckets of other functions that I haven’t got round to using yet I am working my way through slowly. I have contemplated purchasing another for the bedroom to use the alarm feature. A very good buy.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great little smart speaker,Nice features for entry level smart speaker purchase. Easy to set up and nice speaker sound. Great for scheduling daily activities or planning your day. Like the additional clock feature also.
4.0,a year ago,Argos,good radio,"the sound on this little dot is nearly as good as my echo plus ..amazing!. only big downside is my 3.99 subscription is only usable on the echo plus, which I wasn't aware off. I thought my dot would be an extension of my echo plus ,ie,- both speakers to play the same music at same time but in different rooms.therefore to me still using one subscription. NO...dot works only as a radio .or you need to upgrade subscription to 9.99.to use both ..but as a stand alone alexa. dot is pretty good"
5.0,10 months ago,Overstock.com,"This is such a fun product! It's small, compact but great! Has really good volume/sound. It doesnt take up a lot of space, it's perfect!

5.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,I love Alexa.,"I'm just starting to get into the Smart home stuff. I now have 2 dots, 3 Sengled smart LED bulbs, and an Insignia TV with Alexa/firestick built in. It's awesome laying in bed saying lights on/off, play 60's music, what's todays weather, put on Netflix, ect. It so fun and convenient. Love it."
4.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,ok,"I would give this product a 3.8 out of 5. I do like that the echo dot is stealth and the color blends in well with the surroundings. I love the fact it gives me an update of the status of my order. It doesn't always pick up the command well, as I would have to repeat myself. Overall, it was a great price and is a nice addition to my electronic stash."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Easy & Portable,I have several of the Echo dots. They are plug and play basically. You can move them around without any issue. Connects easy. Since they are inexpensive you can get several and put them throughout your house. Sound quality is great.
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,This is our third dot!,"We have one in the kitchen, bedroom and living room. We love playing music in the house, using them for light switches and being able to play music for the dog while we’re gone. We have a plug programmed to a light for our dog. So it turns on with a schedule we made since it gets dark before we get home at night."
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Good overall.,"It becomes really handy if you have smart home feature enabled. However, it does not perform at it greatest when you need to broswe internet to get into some detail on daily basis. Good overall, can be used to play games or relaxing music. Solid 4 stars."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Great,"Echo dot, is the perfect way to enter smart home world, and to be honest even if your not interested in that it's a great little speaker for your home. Capable of loads of things - I used mine mainly to play Spotify and radio through and I believe for the price it's one of the smallest, sharpest and best sounding smart speaker out."
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Amazing,I am new to this smart home process but I can say that I am very pleased with this Amazon product. I use it frequently for music and to check my local weather. The speaker for music is amazing. I am able to use it as an alarm and timer. I am learning from it and it's learning my habits at home. I am so far happy with the purchase.
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,3rd generation has better sound quality,"I have a couple of the original Echo Dots and the new 3rd generation has more rich, full tone. Other functions are the same. I also have the Google Home Mini with sound quality equal to the Dot Gen 3. In my opinion Google has a better database for answering questions than Amazon. Amazon is getting better but not as good as Google. I like the intercom feature with the Amazon devices."
5.0,3 weeks ago,influenster.com,What i like about Alexa she is small and loud. The sound of it is amazing loud and the sound is nice.

5.0,a month ago,Argos,Does everything you require,Another great item to have for all your daily requirements from reading the latest news and weather forecast to playing songs old and new and even setting alarms for you. It kind of makes a radio obsolete now though as does everything that can do ☺ a great handy item to have.
5.0,3 weeks ago,influenster.com,"I usually use it mostly for listening to music while I cook, or get ready in the morning. Sometimes I ask the weather or a random fact but the sound quality is the most important thing to me. I love how loud the 3rd generation gets.

Easy to set up and use."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Perfect addition to the house along with the Echo,I bought 2 of these as I already have the echo 3rd generation. I now have a dot in the living room and kitchen. Very easy to use. Also bought one as a gift for my 6 year old for christmas and my Dad. Great for all ages and technologicsl abilities.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Awesome buddy,"Useful to turn off all lights you may forgot to before going to bed. My son plays a music he likes and dances. He sometimes solves a math Hw(?) I heard that “Alexa, what is 7 plus 2?” .... .... I play a music for my dog when I have to leave her alone. So many things you can do with this small dot."
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Great sound for the size,I replaced my 2nd Gen dot with this one and let me tell you the difference in sound is very noticeable. It is slightly larger than the 2nd Gen but the looks are so much better. These are perfect to have around the house and great for me since I have a 2 story home it makes it easier to communicate with my kids instead of yelling for them from downstairs.
5.0,a month ago,influenster.com,"We use ours for so many things. Adding items to the shopping list no matter where you are in the house.

5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Much easier to setup better sound,"I love this 3rd generation they are so much easier to setup and the sound is better. I can not say the same from the microphones. Even when Amazon claims that this generation have much better microphones, many times they don't heard me, while I hardly ever have that problem with my 2nd generation ones."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,it's great,I use this every day. It helps me remember appointments. lets me know what the temperature is and turns my lights off and on when told. I enjoy using it and it was very easy to set up. I've only had a for a few weeks and I'm still learning what it is capable of. but it's fun learning.
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Echo dot is compact and easy to setup,I enjoy listening to various radio stations. I use the Amazon music app to search for songs available to play. The future nature sounds is helpful for sleeping. Kids enjoy asking Alexa questions.
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Hello Alexa,"I was not sure quite what to expect with this but am happily surprised and impressed. Each day you seem to find out more and more things Alexa can do...sleeps until Xmas, play Pointless, listen to music its great. The sound is quite rich and impressive, easy to set up and with an account such as Spotify there are endless choices. For anyone who lives alone its like having a friend there, when it suits you. Alexa has quickly become a member of our family."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great for communicating with family upstairs,I have been looking for a way to get the kids downstairs without yelling. This has been a perfect solution. I can drop in on their Echo Dot (2nd Gen) and set an alarm to get up in the morning with some annoying (to them) alarm sounds that get their attention and call them for dinner. A lot more pleasant than my old routine. Still learning the other features but very happy so far.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Love these Echo products.,"We really liked the previous version of this, but thought it may be time for an upgrade. Wow did they make this better. More attractive and way better sound and voice recognition than earlier models (even though those were good, too). Really LIKE it!"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Smart Speaker,"Amazon Echo is a solid speaker. It has an improved design, and a much better sound quality compared to the 2nd generation Echo. It is a must-have tool in the kitchen. I can ask it to play music, set alarms or timers and scheduling reminders. Alexa won't always know the answer to all of your questions, but overall, I have been extremely happy and strongly recommend it."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Nice addition for our smart home,This is the 3rd Echo dot (3rd gen) that we buy. The speaker is very good for its size and the microphones work as they are supposed to. Near the tv speaker Alexa some times gets confused. When you mute the TV it responds correctly.
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Echo V.S Google,We have had an Echo for over a year but received a Google with a purchase. I put the google on my desk just to try it and I like that it has a lot more personality than the Echo. I wanted another device for my shop area so I picked up another Echo on sale but after a little more time using the Google I returned the unopened Echo when I saw the Google on sale for the same price We still use the Echo to run some of smart home features but I like Google for my desk. I would still recommend an Echo for for smart home devices but Google will be my desktop companion.
5.0,2 weeks ago,Best Buy,The gift that keeps on giving,"Gotta love Alexa. Easy to install, use and be continuously impressed by. There are so many things it can do and new abilities being added each week. If you don’t already have one, get one. Stop thinking about it and hit add to cart right now. You can thank me later."
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Upgraded to Gen 3,"My whole house is powered by smart devices. Having an echo dot in each room makes everything so easy. We control the lights,locks,AC,tvs,etc. all with the sound of our voice. The speaker on this 3rd gen ia WAY better than the previous generations."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,"Great value, good sound","Although the sound quality isn't as good as its larger siblings, It doesn't disappoint. Considering the size and price, the quality is rather good and can be further improved by adding an external speaker, if you're that bothered. At the price, this bit of kit is a winner."
5.0,11 months ago,Currys,Ashley's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 3rd gen (2018) Sandstone,"Pros: Love the cute and compact design.

5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,A Solid Echo Dot Upgrade,The Amazon Echo Dot is the easiest way to add voice integration to your smart home and the 3rd generation Echo Dot does not disappoint. Attractive design and a better sounding speaker makes this a great addition to the Echo line up.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Nice to have around,"Alex is fun to have around to answer those questions about the outside temp, what the weather is going to be for the weekend. It was easy to set up with the voice commands and voice recognition. She even lets you change her wake up word. Have second unit to install."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,LED clock makes a big difference!,"The echo dot 3rd generation is excellent as an Alexa device and very good quality speaker for music, etc. Having the LED clock makes it a perfect night stand clock, alarm clock, and Alexa device all in one. It dims very nicely at night so does not disturb sleep."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Alexa in mini...,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for the in laws, we have the bigger version so wasn't sure what to expect sound wise but I must say we were all pleasantly surprised, good crisp clear surround sound. It performs all the same tricks as the bigger version for a fraction of the price, very easy to order using click n collect, friendly staff in store."

5.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Much improved over the previous model,"I had a echo dot 2 and it was fine, however I liked the new design of the echo dot 3 and wanted to give it a try. The volume is significantly better and the bass is better on the 3rd edition.

4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Awesome value for the price,"Amazon redesigned this from last year's model it's bigger, has more mics, and much improved sound. I did not like the fabric design nor the properitary power cord. For $50 this is a good voice assistant for a small room (bedroom, kitchen, bathrom). With Black Friday and Christmas sales coming soon pick up a couple as stocking stuffers, everyone would like getting one."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Love it,"The echo dot makes life easy and fun Easy to use, even our four year old can be understood Normally understands commands on first attempt We added switches and plugs for the Dot to control. Switch installation wasn’t hard for my husband- didn’t even take 30 minutes. Plugs were as simple as plug in add the app and tell Alexa to turn them on and off. Great device - we will be adding more in different areas of the house."
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Much better than the original Echo Dot,Got this for free with the Ring Pro purchase. It's a good deal since I've been wanting to transition off 2.4GHz band. Seems heavier and sound better in comparison to the 1st generation Echo Dot. Mic seems to pick up my voice from across the room better as well.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,I just love having this in my house,"This is such a great product because it helps me navigate through a busy day. I can set up alarms, timers, anything I want to look up.

5.0,2 months ago,staples.com,Great for Pandora Radio,"Great for listening to Pandora Radio. Just by talking, you can change stations. Great sound. And yes, it turns lights on and off if you request it to do so. Fun instrument. Can have lots of uses depending on individual desires."
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Great for streaming audio,Bought this unit to connect with a stereo system in my work area. Setup was a breeze. It worked the first time I used it and every time thereafter. It is connected to the receiver by a 3.5 mm cable to RCA plug. The unit was on sale at about 50%off - making it an even better purchase.
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,3rd Gen works just as great!,"Son purchased this 1-his other wasn't working properly and 2-it was 1/2 off. He loved his first one and we figured it stopped working since he used it literally nonstop. With that said, his second one hasn't given him a bit of trouble. He loves it especially because it will play his Spotify."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Alexa Echo-Dot Nubee,This is my first echo-dot and so far I'm really pleased with it. It took me sometime to figure out that you had to incorporate alexa skill for it to work with some of your smart devices but once I did that the majority of them work well. There are a few skills that need upgrading (don't work well) but over all I wondered why I didn't do this sooner. The dot is a great purchase if you're into smart home devices and digital assistants.
5.0,9 months ago,Argos,"I bought this echo dot for my brother for Christmas, he is hard to please some times. He was quite pleased with getting this item.

I have it located on bar between living area and kitchen and it fills the entire apartment with sound.

Mine came free with A Ring cam, my grandson said if u don’t want I will take it. Guess what! I love it!! No way, grandson. They have 5. In fact I have already bought one other"
4.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Great little gadget.,The dot is a nice little addition to our home. We love to listen to music so we have one in 3 different rooms. The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is that every once in a while all of the speakers don’t play like they are suppose to. One or two may come on and then 5 or 10 minutes later the third one will come on.
5.0,2 weeks ago,Best Buy,A must have in every house!,It makes life easy if you know how to make good use of it. I can control the smart devices in the house. I can play music in multi rooms. I can drop-in and communicate with my kids in their room. I can drop an announcement to all devices. There’s so much more!
4.0,a year ago,Argos,Neat little device with many potential uses,"This was the first of three Amazon Echo devices that I purchased over Christmas. Easy to setup using the Alexa App on my phone. Over the Christmas break my family and I have used it for games and quizzes, to answer questions, as an intercom with other Echo devices, to stream music from phones, and to play music with Amazon Music (2 million songs with Prime account), Amazon Music Unlimited (40 million songs for monthly subscription)."
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Interesting, but really get so little for so much!","Not a big fan of these types of gadgets. I am a retired computer professional, so not an old horse out of tune with new technology. I have a lot of technology, old and new, that I get a lot of benefit from, but I find this generally less than useful. Basically a very expensive dust collector. If you are into music and have to have it going all of the time, it might be helpful, but not my bag."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Love these,"Having speakers that listen when you’re not asking them to is, frankly, creepy. But the ability to play music throughout my home and control my lights with my voice, I adore! You can turn off their mics if you feel the listening to you is weird too, you press the button and the ring turns red to let you know it’s not listening. Great alternative to Sonos, a lot cheaper! I’ve loved mine so much I bought five of them!"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Love the smaller size,Unlike the Amazon Echo the Amazon Echo Dot is just the right size to have in smaller rooms. With the much cheaper price you can have them in multiple rooms throughout the house. The sound quality is great and their appearance is much better than previous generations.
5.0,a month ago,Currys,Alex waddell's review of Amazon Echo Dot 3rd Generation with Clock - Sandstone,Pros: Nice sound for small item Cons: Can't get BBC radio now as amazon won't stream it on tune radio as that's what they use.. So if you like to listen to BBC stations I would avoid unless there's another way of getting alexa to play it.
5.0,2 months ago,staples.com,very useful gift,"I bought this as a gift for my father who has some memory issues. He loves it. Not only does it help him remember things, he enjoys music, it reads to him, he plays games with it and we are getting ready to connect it to the lights in his house. Its easy to use and easy to set up. Definitely a great gift"
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Better late than never,"We are a bit late to the ‘Alexa game’ seeing as most people have one already, but I have to say I’m really impressed it. It was a gift for our 11 year old daughter and she hasn’t stopped playing music through it (via our Amazon prime music) and asking it various questions. Would recommend if you don’t have one already."
4.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Better than earlier generations,"Better than earlier generations. Solid sound quality, richer than my other echo dots. One criticism: I wish the power cord were longer. Would also be fun to have one that had a rechargeable battery."
4.0,2 weeks ago,Best Buy,Very simple to use,Recently bought this Echo Dot for my daughter who absolutely loves it! Also bought one for my son last year who uses it constantly. And of course one for myself and my wife. Love having our Echo Dot For our music playlist and for ordering off of Amazon.
4.0,11 months ago,ebay.com,It will work better when I learn more about how it works,"I like it but I don't like how hard it is to is at multiple places. It takes quite a bit to get it hooked up... It should be much easier then that otherwise once it's finally connected it's ok. I don't use Amazon music so it gets a bit picky on what I can listen to but I'm learning about it yet. I'm willing to say, some of the problem is I have a lot to learn."
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Great value,"Was desperate to get hold of two of these for Christmas and Amazon were not releasing any more until mid-January. After a hectic night on Stock Informer, I managed to secure two of them, 30 miles apart! The kids love them and have had brilliant fun with them playing music, asking Alexa to play games and sending silly messages to one another. At 50% off, it was worth the drive to collect. Thoroughly recommended both Argos and the product."
5.0,a month ago,influenster.com,This is a nifty little gadget to have on hand. I have no cons that I’ve encountered so far. It’s perfect for what I use it for.

5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great alarm clock,"I bought this for my husband, he wanted something that wasn’t real bright and we already had a dot on the nightstand so replacing it with this one that has the alarm clock on it was perfect. Also the numbers aren’t bright and the light level is adjustable. He loves it and it has worked out great!!"
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Does exactly what it says on the tin,Theres just no other words than amazing. Bought this for my fiancè as a Christmas present he absolutely loves it. Even bought a second one for our bedroom. ALEXA is the next generation of technology.
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Better sound than 2nd gen echo dot,"The new echo dot is almost 2x bigger than the 1rst and 2nd gen echo dot. It also ditched the usb plug for a 15w proprietary plug, which is a bit disappointing. However the trade off is much better sound and even a hint of bass. The mics seem to pickup even when it’s playing music, which is a relief, not having to shout at the echo when it’s playing something."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great Value For Smart Speaker,Great value for a smart speaker. The audio quality is good for spoken word not too good for quality music listening. Alexa has a wide variety of skills (actions) it can take and there are many devices that are compatible with Alexa.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Serves its purpose well.,"Sound quality of the 3rd gen much better than the 2nd gen. Otherwise both work well. I found this out by getting a 2nd gen and returning for another 3rd gen. Initially I found it a little confusing to setup through the app. Once I realized what to do it went well. I've used this more than expected, wasn't certain where to keep it and therefore got a second. It's a big plus if you have streaming SiriusXM."
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,"Very handy, space saver and clear beautiful sound","I like to listen to my favorite songs and artists. I ask if there is any notifications, I also want to connect to my television, I use it as an alarm when I’m cooking, I ask about the weather report, basically there is a lot of use of this tiny device, excellent."
5.0,9 months ago,Argos,My Amazon Echo Dot,"The Amazon Echo Dot is small and compact and Sounds just as great as the Origanal Amazon Echo.. It's easy to setup up and with its size, it's easy to place without taking up too much space. I would recommend this item to anyone who has a love for music as the sound quality is crystal clear and giving a 360 degree sound."
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Excellent product,"The 3rd generation dot is essentially the same as the others however the sound quality is much improved. It’s not extremely loud, so please do not think you are inquiring surround sound quality, but it is a nice, clear sound. I did not notice any other big differences."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Exceeded Expectations,"We love our new Alexa devices. It has made things easier in a lot of ways. We use the timer and music functions while in the kitchens, as well as the drop in feature to have intercoms around the house. I especially enjoyed the routine function that allows us to set a series of command functions i.e. turn off lights, and turn on switch with just one phrase. Works well with Phillips Hue and TP Link switches"
5.0,a month ago,Currys,Christopher's review of Amazon Echo Dot 3rd Generation with Clock - Sandstone,"Pros: Awesome product - the clock on the front is perfect and dims / brightens according to light conditions. We use it as a radio alarm clock as you can ask it to ""Set alarm at 6.30am to Heart FM Radio Station"" Cons: No"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Alexa ...,We are a family of Alexa lovers. Every room in my house and my parents house and our family beach house has an Alexa device in it. This new generation of dots has a much better speaker it doesn't sound as bad as the last generation. It's a great way to get Alexa in every room and still be able to play some music from time to time. But don't get me wrong it's definitely not a replacement for my nice Sonos speakers!
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Very useful item to have.,I like being able to hear my home and make a call to my home on this device. Speaker is good. This device stays on and always ready to follow a command. If it comes unplugged just plug it back in to continue usage. No need to reprogram it. Really like this device. User friendly.

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Alexa, Write Me A Review!","This is my 5th Amazon Echo device, the first one of the 3rd generation Echo Spot (I have the Gen1 & Gen2 already). This one is slightly larger but smoother on the aesthetics with more rounded edges than previous models. The voice recognition is slightly improved in a ""noisy"" environment and functions perfectly for recognizing commands and executing scenes within the house."
4.0,9 months ago,ebay.com,Very helpful but setup was a hassle,"First things first, if you guy it of eBay chances are that it is registered to the person who u bought it from's account. When you order, have them de-register it. Now unto the review. Its an awesome gadget to have and it works as advertised. Ps. The mobile app isn't working for me so i had to set it up on my laptop."
5.0,a month ago,very.co.uk,Amazing quality,"Bought this for my beauty room and was worried the sound wouldn’t be great for the price. I was so wrong - sound quality is as good as the bigger one, and was so easy to set up taking a few minutes using the Alexa app. Doesnt take up much room at all and just sits nice on my beauty station!"
4.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Convenient to have,It’s nice to have Alexa to turn on smart lights and other smart technology that I have. But I need to invest more time to learning all of its functions and don’t have that free time yet. Also don’t like that you have to have premium accounts to stream anything when it works fine from the phone.
4.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,It sometimes comes on by itself. Creepy,I’m sitting in my bonus room and then all of a sudden music starts playing. There is no “Alexa” command given prior to the music playing. The sound is fantastic and it can really take your home into the next decade with the variety of things it can do.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Happy upgrade,"This is definitely worth upgrading. Sound quality and volume are noticeable improvements immediately. I have three echo dots and one echo dot second generation. I kind of want to replace all my old echo dots. Visually it’s more pleasant as well. The one negative is that if I do upgrade all my dots, I would need new outlet mounts for all of them."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Excellent intro into the world of Alexa,Great intro into the world of what Alexa can do. It has nearly all the functions of the more expensive models and was actually fun to learn and add additional units in other rooms. The speakers have surprisingly good sound.
4.0,a year ago,Micro Center,"It will change your home lifestyle, for the better.","While I have never been a fan of having tech companies or government listening in I still have to say these echo devices do make a lot of things easier. Whether it's listening to music or controlling all the lights with just my voice, the possibilities are endless. You can get news, weather, jokes, everything. Heck, it even helps prevent the spread of germs since you don't have to touch appliances (or home lights) to turn them on or off."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Echo Dot works as described,"We got the Echo Dot free with the purchase of a ring camera. This is not something we would have purchased, but am happy that we have. Easy to set up and use. Purchased an additional Echo Dot to put on our lower level. Would recommend for anyone."
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,I Love this little gadget,"I was looking for a speaker and a gadget to play music from my iPhone on. I got more than that, I got someone to answer my questions, tell me the time, the weather, wake me up, control my home, all with my voice, and I can listen to music from my phone. I recommend this product. It's a purchase you'll not regret."
4.0,a month ago,Currys,Ashley's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 3rd Gen 2018 Charcoal,"Pros: Great sound quality. Compact design. Cons: Connects using Alexa. Alexa seems to get confused with radio stations.Also, has issues working across Platforms, particularly Sonos."
5.0,11 months ago,ebay.com,Awesome product!!,"I already own two 2nd gen Dots, and I wanted to get a new 3rd Gen Dot. The speaker is definitely better, and the fabric around it looks awesome!! New features are constantly being added, and the Announce feature has been used a number of times. Don't hesitate to buy!!"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great Product,"Received one of these for free when we bought our new TV. Came back and got two more for other rooms of the house. Now we can have music throughout the house as well as an intercom system using the ""Drop In"" function. Great item for the money."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great hands-free device,"Alexa is a lot of fun! My family uses it for all kinds of things from trivia questions to weather information! It has all kinds of different features built into it. It can be your alarm clock, Radio, even a joke teller! I also used Alexa to control my Christmas lights outside via the smart plug from Amazon! I would definitely recommend this item!"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great Smart Assistant,The Amazon echo dot is a really great smart speaker. I have 3 of them so far throughout my house along with 2 Homepods. The echo dots are good for a bedroom and areas like that. The bigger speakers will be wanted in areas like your living room.
5.0,5 months ago,Argos,My echo dot is great,My new echo dot is great. I can set my alarm and it wakes me up without fail. I can ask it to do anything and it will oblige. If there’s something troubling me and I need a quick answer it delivers it there and then. I also ask it to play music and enjoy listening to the radio. Every household must have one!
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Great sound for the price,"The echo dot was easy to set up and the sound quality was excellent for such a small device. I have additionally connected it via Bluetooth to an external speaker to give wider range and this too was very simple and straightforward to do. I highly recommend the echo dot. Purchasing from Argos was also great, a straightforward and fast delivery service that I would recommend."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Great product and value,"Echo dot is a tremendous value and The small size make this very convenient for any space. Speaker is ok, but this tiny unit is is capable of all the same features as the regular size Amazon echo. I have 5 of these in each room in the house. Love it!"
5.0,5 months ago,John Lewis,The ‘lady’ with all the answers!!!,"So, so useful. Alexa has the answer to most questions and the range of other things she does is mind boggling (setting alarms, telling jokes or interesting facts and playing your favourite songs to name but a few). Bought this one for a friend after getting one for myself - great little gizmo!!!"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Surprisingly Useful,"Didn't know I ""needed"" one till I got one......they're really useful in so many ways. Bought 2 for Christmas gifts and ironically also received one. I was always mildly curious about them, but was never compelled to get my own. Well that changed drastically after I decided I might as well hook it up. Wow...what a cool little gadget! Have 4 of them now, they play music, answer questions and so much more.... gy"
4.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,It’s growing on me everyday...,I love this because it’s perfect size for my bedroom. I’m only three days into it and it’s growing on me every minute. The audio does get a bit muddy when it’s turned up all the way. So far I enjoy the apps too. The daily trivia questions it can give you is a. I’ve touch as well.
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Excellent and compact!,"This is my first Alexa - have to say Im looking to buy another. Its so compact, the sound quality is excellent and its so handy asking her to add things to reminders or shopping lists instead of searching round for pens and paper. I have also purchased the smart plugs so she also turns my lights on and off with the darker nights coming. Really pleased and would highly recommend - good price point too."
5.0,8 months ago,Argos,Great piece of tech,Great piece of tech from a great company. Excellent speaker and tech. Easy to setup and use. Already linked to other smart devices. Purchasing from argos was also simple and always great to be able to pick up my purchase without waiting for it to be delivered.
5.0,2 weeks ago,Best Buy,Very happy with this item,"Very happy with my 3rd Gen version. This is my first Alexa Dot unit and I was hesitant to own one at first. After having it set up and enabling it to turn on my home theater receiver for music, I was impressed. Now I want to purchased several more to have one in each room in the household."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Amazing!,Please go and buy one! Download the Alexa App and Amazon Music and your set with endless amounts of music. It has great sound quality and doesn't take up any space in your home. Can move from room to room if needed. Great design. So happy with mine
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,works as expected,Purchased these primarily to use as an intercom so I can communicate with my wife who is on a different level of the house. I also operate several lamps in various rooms. My only suggestion is to have a way to disconnect each without removing the wifi connection. This will give me a solution for when the grandkids visit. They love to play with device and drive eveyone crazy.

5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Great for music and information,I have several Dots in different rooms. The 3rd Gen has even better sound than the Gen 2 and it is prettier than the earlier generations too. Love having the option of listening to the same music in all rooms or a different song in each room.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Way better sound than the last gen of this model.,"This Echo works great, as the last generation one did, summoning Alexa to answer instantly, and carry out tasks, etc. But where the improvement over the last generation Echo is that this little thing can really pump out some clean sound. This model is great for a kid room, bathroom, or kitchen so you can listen to music while your there, get a recipe, etc."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Really impressed,"I never really wanted this. It came free with another purchase, and I probably would never have bought it on my own. That said, I am really impressed with the quality of the voice recognition and the accuracy of its responses. I don't use it often, but it does come in pretty handy at times."
5.0,7 months ago,bt.com,Keith's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 3rd gen (2018) Sandstone,"Pros: The ease of searching via Alexa for music, information and various other things by voice command. It’s size and the ability to place it in virtually any position and in any room of the home Cons: The fact that there are persons listening to the commands given on the purpose of improving the system. This could be considered as an invasion of privacy"
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Echo-Dot,"We have an echo-dot downstairs and we have surprisingly enjoyed it. The speaker itself i incredible for such a compact device. We were in the market for an alarm clock for our son's bedroom, however we thought an echo-dot can serve him in well. So far so good, he seems to be enjoying it"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,works great,Setup is really easy. Integrates well with multiple smart home features in my home.

5.0,a year ago,Argos,Better than expected,I have wanted one for ages but thought it was a bit of a novelty so when it was on offer I took my opportunity. Well I'm pleasantly surprised at how fantastic it is the sound quality for playing music is fab and more than loud enough without additional speakers. You can ask basically whatever you want. I love that you can ask for reminders and add to your calender just by asking. Highly recommend it's so much fun.

4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Love the Functionality, Wish It Was Louder","We are really enjoying the functionality of having the echo and Alexa in our kitchen! It is exceptionally responsive, and makes it easier for us to cook via verbal recipes, get answers to questions, or just listen to music. The only aspect I wish was a bit better is the volume control, as we find it doesn’t seem to go very loud, sometimes making it hard to hear if were in an adjacent room. But overall we like it!"
5.0,3 weeks ago,Best Buy,"Alexa, thanks for everything.","I use my Echo for just about everything.

4.0,a year ago,Argos,Great for bedroom,"Brought two of these for Christmas, 1 for each daughter. They love them! So many different things you can do, however, came up with an issue and that was because my daughters shared amazon prime.

5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Excellent!,"This little gadget is amazing! I love to listen to the music I can get because this tiny powerhouse has great sound.

5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Excellent Alexa device for the price!,"We purchased this device so we could discover what was so good about owning an Alexa. We weren't disappointed; the benefits are numerous. You can find out almost anything, control WiFi stuff, and now, even monitor your home when you're away. I recommend it totally."
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Awesome Tech,I have several of these now and these sound pretty good considering how small the footprint is. Pretty amazing all the stuff they can do and control via Alexa. I have a light in the bedroom I control with this and can control my firestick as well. Pretty cool!
3.0,a month ago,Best Buy,I'd still recommend the Google Home to Echo,"I have a few of these, including the integration with Facebook's Portal (with Alexa). The Echo devices are nice if you do a lot of shopping on Amazon, but I prefer the connectives and features of Google's smart home speakers more and have about 12 of them throughout my house. I do like the Amazon delivery notifications, however."
4.0,4 months ago,Argos,"It is Good, But...","It’s a great little thing, but there was a bit of difficulty connecting to WiFi.

Music quality could be a little clearer as it’s a bit echoey, but okay nonetheless."

5.0,a year ago,Argos,Fits in perfectly!,"We have found the Echo Dots have fitted straight into the family, we are able to use them for internal calls (& external family. Communication too ~ much to my parents delight; the Grandchildren call to make their own arrangements ) The lights upstairs have communicated well & the amount of time they shine has dramatically been reduced. (Hopefully, the bank account will feel the benefits soon) Arguments between the kids have been reduced as now they listen to their own music in their rooms."

5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,I love this speaker,"I received this product when I purchased my tv and I didn’t think I would use it. But once I set it up it became my new best friend. This little speaker is like my personal assistant. It can check the weather, play music and pretty much search up anything I need to look up."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Huge improvement in sound quality,"I primary use my Amazon devices for playing music so sound quality is important to me. The sound quality of the Gen3 Echo Dot is vastly improved over at least the Gen1 Echo Dot it replaced. I agree with the several people who have told me they consider the Gen3 Echo Dot sound quality to be as good as that of the ""full sized"" Alexa devices."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Best Dot you can get,"Full disclaimer: I love my Apple HomePod. With that out of the way, yes, this is a good smart speaker. The previous generations of the Amazon Echo Dot felt cheap and the sound was very tinny. This third generation is a nice step in the right direction. If you are looking to get your first smart speaker and are on a tight budget, this one might be for you."
5.0,9 months ago,John Lewis,Echo Dot,"Really impressed with this. Can play music , use as timer, ask Weather and many other uses.

5.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Great product for a family,The kids love being able to tell “Alexa” the music they want to listen too. They also enjoy listening to audio books using the dot.

This one seems to get quiet while playing music, when I am having conversations near it. Really freaky. And stops playing music at different time segments. I am probably going to send them back and get googles."
4.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Very convenient,"So happy i bought this- Alexa is so convenient to have, I put on in every room. Only complaint is that the speakers aren’t too good. The one in the bathroom is already sounding bad and I had to exchange the one in my living room because it sounded like the speaker blew after one week of having it. Other than that I like it"
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Working great eventually,"Took two days to set up due to Amazon Alexa server problems. Thought it was faulty initially as I have another one which was working fine. Tried it again next day and it worked as it should have. Great sound and controls all lights, appliances etc as per other echo without having to set it all up. Very happy with it after initial frustration trying to get it connected to server."
5.0,a year ago,Currys,PENNY's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 3rd Gen 2018 Charcoal,"Pros: Not having to switch the light on in the morning to see what time it is, because light wakes me up too much, and if it’s only 5am I can just turn over and go back to sleep. The alarm is also much gentler than on the I phone. Cons: It is very voice specific, and you do have to use the correct command that Alexa understands."
5.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Enjoying the versatility in my kitchen!,"I enjoy using Alexa in my kitchen. I get music, I use her timer, she’ll defines words if I’m reading and I’m only 50% sure of what the word is, Tells me jokes, sings happy birthday to my friends, tells me the weather, gives me the morning news and daily Bible verse. That’s what I remember off the top of my head. Can call family and friends."
4.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Fun,"I basically got this to have background music at home and in the office. Since then I have added one with a screen so we can video chat with the ""technically challenged"" Grandparents! My 6 year old loves that she can actually call her grandma and grandpa when she gets home! It makes the miles away seem smaller"
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Turns on/off the lights by voice,"We can now turn lights on and off when we're away, giving the illusion that we're at home. Drawbacks are: Amazon automatically signed me up for Prime. I was able to cancel but you need to watch out for this as you can ve easily caught out. In adverts for this item people ask it to play music and it does. That will only work if you have a Spotify premium account or Amazon Prime /music account. Still good though and overall I consider it was a good purchase."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,3 Year Old Daughter Loves the Echo Dot,Received this free with purchase of Ring 2 Doorbell. Used the Echo Dot to integrate and alert is for motion or doorbell rings. My daughter also loves listening to music and also asking Alexa to sing Jingle Bells. Great product for listening to music and able to perform other functions.
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Helpful But Creepy,"We use this all the time and even find ourselves calling out to Alexa when we're not at home out of habit. That being said, she will randomly come on and say she didn't catch that when we weren't talking either at all or to her. She won't pull up certain things like music if it is in a different language, info on certain topics, etc. Nevertheless, we still use it. Decide which is more important to you. Helpfulness or Creepyness"
4.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Looses Connection Often,Sound quality is terrific for a speaker this size. Getting the daily news and weather reports are handy...setting alarms has been helpful and the trivia games are fun. We received this free with the purchase of an Amazon Fire tv so the value was excellent.
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,This great thing to have for information,I really enjoy having Alexa be able to answer my questions immediately. Also having the weather in an instant. Music of my choice and eventually I will be able to control the light and tv. I'm a senior citizen so this technology is all new and exciting to me.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Replacement for Sirius/XM Receiver,Our portable stereo box broke which received Sirius/XM signals through its built in Satellite receiver after 14 years. We purchased Amazon's Echo Dot (3rd Generation) and we're pleasantly surprised that you can receive Sirius/XM through Wi-Fi. Sirius/XM gave us a nice discount on subscription price as well! Sound quality is amazing for a speaker so small!!!

4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Excellent upgrade int he DOT family of Echo produc,"This is an excellent update to the Dot. We had the first gen and that sounded awful compared to this. This is not going to WOW you in sound, but it is serviceable for what it is intended to do. Works great overall, easy to setup."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Great device,I wanted something handy for my niece that lives out of town. She is only 6 and uses the Alexa feature to help her with homework and to call me. She's too young for a cell and the echo dot allows her to call me. She loves it and so do I. Excellent device at a great price.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,good adjunct to bigger Alexa,I have not yet opened this and installed this Echo Dot but I expect it to function as well as the original Alexa I received as a gift. That is why I got this one. I happened to be in Best Buy for a Tile purchase and saw that this Echo dot was free with the purchase of a Tile package of 4. I am grateful to Best Buy for offering this deal.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Amazing!,It is truly amazing that such a small device can do so much! I use it for basic info like the weather but you can do so much more. This is the first dot that I've bought since the original one and they have really improved the speaker. This is great to stream music.
4.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Smart little thing,This thing (Alexa) is so smart it can practically answer all your questions! It plays your songs too and read out to you your Kindle books and food recipes step by step. I just wish it has rechargeable batteries and not just wired so you’re not a hostage to the wall.
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,So practical,"This is such a practical little device. I have Siri on my iPhone but I don’t always have it on me especially in the kitchen which is where we placed this. I use it for the timer, unit conversions, music, phone calls, etc. It also listens better that Siri on my phone."
5.0,a year ago,Target,"All anyone needs is one. I set the echo dot up in my kitchen. I have Alexa tell me my commute time to work, set kitchen timers, play music/radio, and give me the weather forecast. It makes life more convenient. I chose the echo dot over the google mini because of the aux port, even though I usually connect our speaker via bluetooth. I would never pay full price for it, so I bought it on Black Friday.","All anyone needs is one. I set the echo dot up in my kitchen.

5.0,a year ago,Target,Small dot....big power,"I had an Amazon Echo (2nd gen) and liked it (until puppies chewed up the cord). I like the Amazon dot 3rd generation. I really like that you can set up a schedule--for example, say, ""Alexa Good morning."" and it will give the weather. Or at a certain time, have Alexa tell you to get ready for bed. The dot is so small and seems to do all the things I did with the tall Echo; so that's great. I'm very pleased with it."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Amazing!,"I bought one for my daughter and one for my wife. I am amazed at the capability of this little unit. My daughter and wife daily show me some new feature. I really don't know anything about this thing, but I can tell you, it is easy and truly enjoyable. My family loves it."
3.0,a month ago,ebay.com,Annoying,Its a bit lazy.. though very clever and efficient .. its also tedious to keep repeating Alexa.... before every command.. it would be good to have an option to change it.. maybe to oy.. or please.. the sound on this model is very empty and like a bean can.. Also being forced to pay an Amazon subscription is a stinger.. Great for an idle teenager I guess .
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Great little gadget for any room,Great gadget to have around the house. So useful for handsfree help! And surprisingly fun entertainment features. We now want to get a couple more for other rooms in the house - useful for lazy teenagers too !

5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Much better than the 1st Generation!,This speaker is waaaayyyy louder than the 1st generation Echo Dot. Of i could trade in my first generation Echo Dot and exchange for one of these I would. My children also love it! I have recommended these to everyone I know!
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Buy,"I've been a happy owner of a 2nd generation Echo and three 2nd generation Echo Dots for a year now, and I was glad to add this to the arsenal. After using it for a few days I am generally pleased with it, but it does have limitations, especially when it comes to sound quality (no surprise there!). I will start by summarizing what's new about the 3rd Generation Dot, then I'll describe the device in more detail, and finally I'll add some thoughts about how to choose which Echo device may be best for you."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Great little gadget,I bought this for my grandchildren who love playing with my echo spot. They were very happy with it. The sound quality is very good for such a small device. Looks nice and is Very compact and ideal for small spaces. Well worth the money

4.0,a month ago,Argos,Smart in looks and smart in ability.,And so the upgrades continue! I'm working my way through all the iterations of this model and there has been improvements in every series.. Seems to be available at a discount at regular intervals and combined with it's 'Alexa' capabilities has proved to be a very good buy.
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Love it with Philips hue,I hated the fact of trying to make my home smart. But after seeing how Philips hue works with it (I know there's other options besides Alexa) and the Black Friday deals this was the best for the price with Amazon plugs for only $5 with purchase of the dot. It does needs more improvements creating routines can get a little annoying I feel like you should have presets already compatible with Philips hue. But other than that it's great
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Nice Upgrade,"This is a welcome upgrade from the original Echo Dot. Besides it looking better, to match the Google Home Mini, it also sees improvement in audio quality. I'm still not sold on Amazon Echo over Google Assistant. They both have their advantages and I wouldn't call either platform a clear winner. For the time being, any smart device I purchase, I will ensure it works with both platforms."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Say her name, say her name !","I love my 3rd Generation Echo Dot so far. It’s sleek, I can tuck it almost anywhere. The sound quality for the price is amazing! She learned my voice and preferences almost immediately. Timer is on point. I’m looking forward to adding some compatible home devices at which time I will update my review. As for now, I would definitely recommend. Good buy !"
2.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Problems,I have a 2nd generation that I had no problems with. Ever since I got the 3rd generation it’s been nothing but problems. Since I put this in my home all of my devices will not connect to the internet with the exception of the 3rd generation DOT. I also noticed that the DOT was listening even when the “wake” word wasn’t being used I don’t trust it and for now neither the 2nd or 3rd generation are heing used in my home....not sure that I will use them again. I more than likely will return them both
5.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,We love Alexa,This is our third Alexa speaker and we are so impressed with the product.

Even our toddler gets in on the action and talk to Alexa.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,The Echo Dot is a family pleaser,"I was skeptical I would find much use with these products, but we now have three and they're a family pleaser. The kids enjoy games like Lemonade Stand, I already have enjoyed plenty of music (you'll need an Amazon Music subscription, though!) and the wife likes the intercom system which can be used rather than yelling all over the house to the kids. Everyone gets something out of these, and they're relatively easy on the checkbook, too! Alexa, thank you!"

3.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great little Dot,"So far it has worked rather nicely. The only thing that worries me is that it will be lite up and we haven't asked anything of it. My kids feel it is listening to us, so we'll see how it goes in the future and if we will keep it around. The only issue so far is when I said my name for recognition - it said something totally wrong and we can't change it."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Awesome,"Great quality and good value for money. Has loads of fun features and responsiveness is fast and snappy. The only downside, sound quality can start to get a bit distorted when listening on full volume but honestly 50% volume is definitely still loud."

5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,HUGE improvement over Dot 1 and 2,Sounds fantastic. Great voice recognition in a noisy room. Easy to pair with another for stereo sound or full home sound. Got it about half-off price so bought a bunch of them. I think they laugh at me when I am not looking though. :-<>
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Love my dots,We are an Amazon Alexa household. We have dots in every room and the bigger Echos in our living and family rooms.

2.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Not as great,Heard a lot about echo and thought to give a try being a google home mini user. But this didnt quite was at par. Audio is good. But alexa is not as smart as OK google. Plus it just has a limited audio song list. Whereas google will play all songs of all genre. And alexa does has hearing problems as well. Many a times it doesnt recognize you calling.

4.0,9 months ago,Argos,Could be better,"This is a good purchase for the price. Criticism are that the sound at lower volumes is pretty poor, sounding very muffled. Also it gets annoying when making a playlist that you often can't get the original version of a song as it doesn't recognise the request & instead will select any remastered versions."

Ask Alexa to play Sesame Street sleepy time album you will thank me.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great device,We have a full sized echo and multiple dots-yes the speaker is not as good as the full sized-but the small size allows you to put it just about anywhere. Reportedly the speaker is better on the 3rd gen compared to 2nd-I don’t really appreciate a difference. Aesthetically I do think it’s an improvement on the prior generations. It’s very simple to connect to a Bluetooth speaker if you are unhappy with the sound.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great little speaker,I recently purchased the Echo Dot for our guest room and it's amazing. The sound is much louder than you'd expect from such a small speaker.

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great addition to your smart home system,"Great addition to your smart home line up. Requires minimal experience on setting up smart home products, directions provided were easy to follow. Only downfall is the responsiveness due to our signal strength WiFi and router placement.

Hooks up with my Directv without any additional devices. I am also able to control my Nest thermostat from Alexa or phone app. Its Xmas time so I use the plug to turn my tree on and off at night!! Went and bought another to use in the bedroom!!"
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Big Capabilities Small Package,This is an amazing little smart HUB. Great to put in a kitchen or any room to just have around and play music or ask it questions when you need a quick answer to something. Being able to control all your smart home technologies is a huge plus too.
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Latest Gen Echo - does the job,The latest 3rd Gen Amazon Echo looks better and has better microphone to hear your commands better than ever. From playing your favorite song to calling your family and with the help of optional devices controlling your entire home with voice commands - echo with Alexa is the way to go!
4.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Good and useful product,"3rd Gen Dot is a fine product. Sound is quite good for what I use it for. It responds well to voice from even 20 or 30 foot ranges and handles smart devices very well. I also have and Echo as primary, but for lesser needs and locations the Dot is perfect."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great technology!,"I bought two of them, one for me one for my girl. There’s so much more to this thing then just setting an alarm or reminder. You can ask Alexa almost any question you can think of..” hey Alexa, what does this mean or that mean? “ most of the time she will answer you with no problem. And the music? Amazing! If you don’t want this thing in your house.. seriously.. your out of Your mind .. forghetaboutit!"
3.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,"Too much hype, just a Bluetooth with commands","I bought this cause i wanted to see how it worked. Long story short if you dont have other amazon components, like the plug, amazon music, etc.... You will only get the half of experience. Now as a Bluetooth device works great and for the price not bad."
4.0,3 weeks ago,Argos,A great and valuable purchase.,I bought the Amazon Echo Dot for my elderly father who suffers from dementia. It has been an invaluable tool in rekindling past memories through music. He absolutely loves it and enables us to share these memories together.
4.0,a year ago,Argos,Getting more useful by the day,"It’s taken me a while to work out what exactly I would use Alexa for. I’m finding that I use Spotify, and the radio most frequently. Creating lists and reminders is also useful - and I love silly little things like if you meow at Alexa she wil meow back- and keep going until you give up. I’ve also connected my lights via WiFi. Not exactly life changing, but kind of cool."
5.0,a year ago,very.co.uk,Love your voice Alexa,I wanted this Dot to play music and I am totally satisfied with it. I have had to subscribe to Amazon Music but the list of songs and radio stations is almost endless. I say good morning and Alexa gives me historical info on what has happened on that day which makes me smile. There are many other uses for Dot but I haven't got around to figure them out yet. Very happy I bought it.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Amazon Echo Dot,Love this device wish I would have purchased a couple more when they were on sale Christmas Eve. Device was easy to set up. Just plug in and download the app to your phone. Alexa has lots of functionality. Would definitely recommend.
2.0,3 weeks ago,Best Buy,"I didn't want one, but it was free","This came as a freebie with the purchase of a large screen TV. I'd rather have had a gift card or future discount, but free is free. Some people trust Amazon and Alexa to eavesdrop on everything going on in their house. I don't so I had no use for it. But I was able to sell it online for $25, so that turned out OK."
5.0,10 months ago,Overstock.com,"Setup was very simple. However adding Spotify and other apps take more time. Once all done its a cool gadget to have, not sure why I waited so long to purchase. I definitely need to buy 2 more, its a must have. The price was a steal, oh and nice they come in different colors.","Setup was very simple. However adding Spotify and other apps take more time.

4.0,10 months ago,Argos,Alexa on a Diet,This Alexa dot is a good entry level echo. The voice recognition is not as sensitive as the original Echo but good enough. The sound quality is fine but if you want to enjoy full HiFi stereo sound you need some plug in Speakers to boost the volume and Fidelity of the Audio.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Love it!!!,I absolutely love my Alexa Echo Dot. It really makes everything so easy to control at home and I love the fact that I can turn off and turn on my lights using my voice. I’m excited to see what other products I can buy that I can sync with this. It’s also pretty cool to be able to wake up and ask Alexa for the news and the weather. I’m able to use it to listen to my favorite music and it’s actually really crisp and clear. Best bang for your buck!
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great little smart speaker,Bought for a childs room that doesn't have over head lighting. We got the smart bulbs for her lamp. Makes it so much easier just having Alexa turn the light on & off for her room. She really enjoys being able to listen to music with it also.
5.0,4 days ago,Best Buy,Great Product!,I have purchased 5 Echo Dots for my house. I have them in every room. They are better than having a stereo system. The sound quality is fantastic. I would highly recommend this product to anyone. It does EVERYTHING!
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Incredibly useful,"Echo Dot is very handy for all of the advertised reasons. For basic set up it is very simple. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that when it comes to linking to multiple units, including fire stick tv, fire tv, or smart tv it frequently gets confused with whether to operate the unit, Bluetooth sound, or sometimes disconnect itself. I have to re-pair it to my fire tv about every other day"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,I can’t get enough of these little guys,The sound quality is great and having access to Alexa in every room makes it easy to communicate with our family members in our 2 story house (we use it as an intercom system). Easy setup and works great for drop ins and announcements. Pair with your phone as a Bluetooth speaker!
5.0,6 months ago,ebay.com,Nice little speaker for general use,"Nice speaker with many useful things...if you have them. I do t have any smart devices except my TV, cellphone and this echo speaker. It works ok but will need to learn more about how it works. I'm satisfied with my purchase. Respectfully, James"
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Awesome upgrade from 2nd generation,"This is my second one of these. The best aspect of this generation compared to 2nd generation is the speaker. It is louder and clearer. The physical design also looks better with surrounding home decor. I""m pleased to own this."
5.0,2 months ago,staples.com,Very handy device,I purchased this as a second Echo Dot for my house. It is an upgrade on the 2nd generation that I already own. I like the newer look of it and I think the speaker sounds better than my original one. Would definitely purchase again.
4.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Awesome sound,"Echo dot having an awesome sound. Alexa working very smothly. 4 stars, because don't like the Alexa app setting. I have Fire TV, Liked with the echo dot. Echo Dot is able to play,pause and shut off. But not able to switch on the TV."
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Easy to use,I got a first gen echo a while ago. I didn’t find it useful at first. I now have two in my home and one a work as well as an ecobee and two amazon smart plugs. I can now control the temp and lighting in my house from anywhere. The echo also helps me keep organized. Very useful.
5.0,8 months ago,very.co.uk,Love Alexa,"I bought Alexa a few weeks ago, my partner loves it, I love it and my 3 year old loves it too. Bought another one for my MIL. Really love everything about it. Would 100% recommend. Remember if you are buying you need internet and a subscription to Spotify or Amazon music"
2.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Good design ok execution,"We bought a previous generation Alexa that was great, so when this one came on sale we jumped! Unfortunately it doesn’t work anywhere close to as well. Most times we need to repeat commands two and three times for it to respond which is annoying but the idea is still great."
5.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Even better than the earlier one,Its amazing how much this l'il device can do. Got it with the deal on the Sengled starter pack and it was really a no brainer to get it. The sound quality is better for sure than the previous generation. Next steps is to try to pair it with the element hub and see how that works
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Echo dot is your flexible friend,Convenient way to access Amazon’s Alexa services. We use ours plugged into a hulking great old school hifi and the sound quality is excellent. You can even link up to a Fire TV and control it using Alexa.
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Hey Alexa!,I’m not usually an Alexa kind of guy. I’m more of a google assistant guy. Don’t have anything against it just prefer it. It’s compatible with my Samsung smart things products so it’s getting put to good use with my TVs and lights and other electronic devices I have set up through out the house.
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Great little piece to have!!,I thought the set up would deter me from using the Echo Dot. I was amazed and had it working in less than 15 minutes. I love it I can listen to my favorite radio station or get the weather or even get a recipe for cooking something different. Great little product!
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Goood but not great,"The amazon echo dot is a nice speaker for the price. However, I’f your not someone whose tech Sabby it can be kind of confusing. With initial setup you need to download the echo app which needs work. In order to play music you either have to pay for Anazons music store, or connect to your pandora which can be challenging. Alexa doesn’t answer more specific questions like the google does."
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Great device for home,I bought a few of them for me and my family and we all love them. I have one in my bathroom and one in the kitchen. It works great for answering some quick questions. It's reading an audible book while I wash dishes. I can call my friends and family and hear music any time I want. Love it.
5.0,7 months ago,Argos,Amazon echo dot - great little thing !,"great little thing ! I use mine for music, no downloads just ask Alexa for the song you want to hear or if you just say play 80`s music it constantly plays its great , sound is good too ! Alexa is great for all sorts of things like weather updates and fact finding, a bargain at the price."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great talking machine,"Love the echo dot. I have one in my bedroom and this new one is in my mom's room. You can ask it anything and it knows alot. If it doesn't know the answer it will say "" I don't know that one"" but it does know math, gives you the news, reads books to you and does a million other things. I love love love it."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Great for the bedroom,I bought this because I had an Echo Dot and a clock both on my bedside table. I wanted to save space and replace the alarm clock which was very bright. This is great for the bedside table. It eliminates the need for a clock and the display dims at night.
5.0,4 months ago,Argos,Perfect electronic gadget and friend :),"I never thought i would need an Alexa in my life, but here we are:- plays music, sets alarms and timers, answers general knowledge questions and a massive catalogue of music all in one small request...alexa play me.. and instantly I am listening to a latest album. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. I have 3 now xx Would like one more :)"
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great voice access to smart home,"I love being able to access my home devices by voice command, and the new intercom feature. One caveat is that the voice recognition refuses to find some of my TuneIn channels. Also, the sound quality isn't as good as regular speakers."
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Easy set-up,"I've had an Amazon Echo for approx. one year, and it works great. I decided to try out the Echo dot. I bought three and have them scattered thru out my home including the garage. The sound quality, voice response and overall performance is fantastic."
4.0,a month ago,Argos,Who knew a speaker could be such fun,The Interaction with Alexa has kept the whole family amused. The echo dot was simple to set up and now makes time spent in the kitchen more fun. Listening to music or even setting timers when cooking and reminders for shopping.
4.0,a week ago,Best Buy,Great FREE item,"Got this item free for buying a fire tv edition tv. Can’t beat FREE. Works perfectly. Just can’t quite figure out how to get it to work with the FireTv. When I say Alexa turn on my tv, she says can’t find device. So still trying to get everything connected."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,We Love Alexa!!!,"We got this as a free gift to go with the ring doorbell pro. We never thought we would like this so much. We already had wifi light bulbs and a wall plug and was able to integrate it with the dot. I liked it so much we now have this one in the bedroom, a dot in the basement and i bought an echo plus for the upstairs. the plus it very good sounding. I have all my music,lights and tv controlled by alexa!! all by voice!!"
4.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Alexa,This device came free with another purchase or I would not have bought it on my own. I like the sound quality when playing music. I like that I can mute device though I don’t really trust it. Spends most of the time unplugged but that’s due to the conspiracy theorist in me.
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Not bad for the price,"I shop a lot from amazon and love how they have everything, but I still don’t feel that Alexa orders properly for me. I try to be specific and she doesn’t always fully understand what I’m trying to order. The sound quality isn’t bad, for the price. Could sound better, but then I would have to buy a more expensive unit. I have my HomePod for listening to music. This is more for listening in on other rooms in the house."
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Oh the possibilities!,"We are still learning everything that Alexa can do, but she's been very helpful (and fun) so far. Easy to set up with the Alexa app. Integrates with other products like our Ring security system. I like the size of the Echo and the fact that it's small and unobtrusive."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Useful in everyday life,At first I wasn't sure if they were too hyped up to be anywhere near as good as it's meant to be; I was positively surprised. I can ask it the most random of questions and also use it to carry out my schedule. It looks good in the room and serves a practical function too. Worth the buy.
5.0,11 months ago,Argos,Great for kids,"My daughter has wanted one of these for a while. I was dubious about whether it would be suitable but it’s great. Very educational multi functional as she plays music, games asks questions for homework and it’s a cool alarm. Well worth the money I’d definitely recommend"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Bought as a gift.,"These are so fun and convenient to have. I bought one for a friend for Christmas. She loves it! They are scattered all over the house in different rooms. Great for communication and announcements, among other wonderful things Alexa can do."
5.0,3 weeks ago,influenster.com,"Love our Amazon Echo Dots! We have 3 of them (as well as other Amazon devices) throughout the house. From playing music, setting timers, alarms, asking questions, the weather, daily updates...you name it! You also can't beat the price of the Echo Dots!","Love our Amazon Echo Dots! We have 3 of them (as well as other Amazon devices) throughout the house. From playing music, setting timers, alarms, asking questions, the weather, daily updates...you name it! You also can't beat the price of the Echo Dots!"
4.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Nice upgrade but improvements Marginal,"The Echo dot 3rd offers better sound quality but nothing to really write home about. It sounds better, feels better, it looks like a finished product. It works as well at previous models and does look richer on your bed stand or side table."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Makes a great gift,"I got this for my dad for Christmas and he loves it! After just buying a new home, hes been trying to turn it into a smart home. He can control his thermostat, door locks, light switches, ring doorbell, and light bulbs all using this little echo dot. The sound isn’t too bad either. Definitely superior to the 2nd gen speakers."
5.0,4 weeks ago,Best Buy,Super easy to use,"I love my echo dot. Very easy and quick setup and you are good to go! It's so nice to just tell Alexa what time I want to wake up, ask her what the weather forecast is, and whenever I want to listen to music I just say it. This little thing is so nice! You can't go wrong buying one for yourself!"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Smart Home Start,I purchased the Amazon Dot (3rd gen) after receiving my first one as a gift. Have them set up in two different rooms. Still learning what I can do with them but I have them set up with my Philips Hue lights to be able control them. I also have them connected to my personal weather station so I can get an update at any time as to what the weather is. Having fun learning what I can do with the Amazon Dot.
2.0,a year ago,Best Buy,OK for simple requests,"It was a Christmas gift. It takes a while to recognize your voice. It’s good for simple requests: What’s the temperature in —-?, with smart plug, “Turn on the lights”. Beyond that the response usually is “Umm, I don’t know that.” It seems to have the same hearing problem that SIRI often experiences. It can be an absolutely quiet room and it doesn’t give the expected answer."
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Great support for the Echo,"My family has both the Echo and the echo dot, both of which work phenomenally. The echo dot is good to have in a spacious apartment or house and works well as a support for the Echo. Would recommend for a small apartment or as a support for the full sized echo in a bigger place."
5.0,6 months ago,ebay.com,Fun for the family,The echo dot has been fun to set up a smart home with. The kids no longer fear going into dark rooms because they can turn on lights by themselves by voice. The games that alexa can play with the kids keep them interested for hours.
5.0,3 months ago,Argos,Nice and compact. Great product,Great product nice and compact. Sound quality lacks above volume 8 really (scale of 1-10) but if it’s loud music your after you might be better off with the bigger version. For the money it’s quality. I will be getting another for upstairs
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Perfect to pair with the other 2,"I have the 1st gen and 2nd gen Echo Plus. This is exactly what I needed for another room. Now all three work together. Unfortunately, now my wife knows how to tell Alexa to make an announcement and I can hear it from anywhere in the house."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Really good fun and informative,The device is small and neat. It’s good fun asking questions. It also connects easy to the smart lights and you can schedule it to switch them on at a certain time. Really good gadget well worth the money.
4.0,5 months ago,ebay.com,Good for the price.,"Received this on Saturday morning and Ive used it ever since but the first thing I realised is its an American plug, so I had to go out and buy a US to UK adapter, but as soon as I done that it worked just fine. Great for kids, parties and all round fun you can ask Alexa many stuff and she will answer it most straight away. I would recommend definitely."
4.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,"Great Sound, but...","Make no mistakes, the echo dot 3rd gen. has fantastic sound quality with a lot of rich tones. It does what a smart device control should, however; it doesn't have the 'smarts' of Google. I get a lot of ""I don't know that"" where I get an answer from Google home/mini."
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Great room companion,"This eco spot is a very easy set up and once we got to understand the situations in which we’d use it, it’s a great addition to any large room. This is our second eco and we truly enjoy the help with timers, updates in news, translations, jokes, playing radio, playing music and turning our lights on and off, to different color settings."
4.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Works OK,"I have a first generation Alexa and then wanted a second portable for travel to hotels on business and pleasure. While at home, this 3rd gen appears to stay connected and runs with fewer issues than the original 1st gen Alexa, I find this harder to set up in hotels than the Google equivalent I borrowed from our Grandson before purchasing the Echo Dot."
4.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,It's good for me,For what I was using it for my daughter's room it served its purpose. It did stop a few times and wouldn't loop White noise that is why I didn't give it a 5-star rating. Overall was satisfied even though I ended up switching for the one with the clock because it was a helpful tool since my girls don't have a clock in their room.
5.0,5 months ago,ebay.com,Great-but need amazon prime!,"Really love this little device, it allows me to put music on without having to switch on laptop etc. Also I use her to google things that have been bugging me for ages! All Id say is that youd need amazon prime too otherwise you definitely dont get the best out of it. All in all super product :)"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Handy smart speaker,"We already had several echo dots, but purchased this one because it came with a free smart plug. We put this dot in the one room that didn't already have one, and are finding it useful there for listening to news, getting weather updates, listening to music, communicating with those in other rooms, etc."
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Love my new Dot!,"I am enjoying my new Dot and learning all it's capabilities. I bought smart plugs so I can control some of my lamps by voice. I like being able to give it many verbal commands that I would previously have typed into my phone or laptop. Makes life easier, for sure! Happy with my purchase."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Fun and cool device,"I have been one of the skeptical folks not wanting a device listening 100% of the time and finally gave in. The Echo dot is great and we've had fun making all sorts of requests and playing games. I linked my SiriusXM account (w/ streaming) and can listen to satellite radio all over the house. There are tons of skills and unlimited possibilities to control all sorts of devices, lights etc."
5.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Great gift for a friend who is terminally ill.,This was a great gift for my friend. She is able to be comforted by any genre of music that she chooses. She listens to soothing music channels as well as favorite songs of favorite artists. Sound is very clear!
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Much Improved Audio Quality at the same price!,The audio quality has improved dramatically since the 2nd gen version! You can now listen to music with depth! All this and at the same price as the 2nd gen. I am replacing all of my 2nd gen units with this one! The only negative is the proprietary charging cable. It no longer uses a standard Micro-USB cable.
5.0,7 months ago,ao.com,"I have really loved this product! Once you get used to what it can do it’s amazing, the weekly emails are great for helping with this. I fully intend to get another one or two for around the house and to get all the smart house appliances that go with it. Definitely worth a purchase at such a great price!!","I have really loved this product! Once you get used to what it can do it’s amazing, the weekly emails are great for helping with this.

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Perfect addition!,"I have this on my nightstand, and the speaker is GREAT for such a small little device, much better than the old version! My husband even commented on how good the speaker is, and he's pretty picky. Ha! I use it to ""drop in"" on the kitchen Alexa to call the kids up or have them do something for me. The alarms and reminders are great, and I love waking up to music instead of a blaring alarm."
4.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Great gadget,This is my second echo dot. The first one I gave to my granddaughter . She loved it and after not having one for a while I missed having one around so I decided to get another one. It has proven to be very useful and serves as a multifunctional gadget!
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Nice upgrade,"Big, big fan of this over the original echo dot. The volume is significantly improved, which eliminates the need for an additional speaker. My girlfriend and I have hosted several parties in our apartment. While this isn't exactly something that will be the center of attention — it's tremendous for background audio. Highly recommend for an upgrade."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great little speaker,"The quality of the speaker improved greatly from the 2nd to 3rd generation. I have several of these around the house all linked together and really enjoy a ""whole house audio"" experience. Only downside is they lose their connection sometimes and have to be setup again."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Great little smart speaker,"The Echo dot is great for audio books, podcast and controlling your smart home devices. Sound quality greatly improved over the 2nd gen I would recommend the larger Echo for music."
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,"Louder, sharper looking than gen2",How I use mine in an Apple ecosystem smart home. -Easy to setup w iOS Alexa app -connects to Apple Music -controls my lights...since I have an echo Too -makes announcements like a modern day intercom -adjusts temp on my Ecobee -plays jeopardy :)
5.0,a year ago,Argos,"Multifunctional for my kitchen, perfect!","Appointments, shopping lists. To do lists, timer, reminders, radio, music, weather etc Alexa dot is perfect for my kitchen, it’s like having a personal assistant with you all day! But the best thing is that it connects to my kids Alexa dots in their rooms on the top floor so I can speak to them without having to run up two flights of stairs or shout! I can’t imagine life without it now."
5.0,2 weeks ago,Argos,Perfect Companion!,This is definitely one of the best buys for me this year... it’s worth every penny! The sound quality is superb and the design is out of this world given it’s compact size! One’s perfect companion and a must-have!!!
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Very full featured,I have 3 of these echo dots and 2 HomePods. The sound on the homepods is obviously better. But for the crazy difference in price these are a great deal. The sound is still easily acceptable and Alexa can run circles around Siri.
5.0,a year ago,Argos,"Alexa, almost part of the family","An amazing product at an amazing price during black friday sales. Very user friendly, easy to set up using the Alexa app and great sound quality. There is a wide range of ""skills"" (apps) which just need to be enabled using the Alexa app and you you are hands free. Especially found the shopping list Skill useful so I could 'tick' things off the list on my phone, saved hunting for a pen."
4.0,a week ago,Argos,The echo dot is very user friendly.,Great little addition to the house. We use it all the time for listening to music. The sound quality could probably do with being a bit better but that's me being picky. Doesn't look out of place on our unit at all and the kids love it.
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Great price and so simple to set up,"A great price for a fabulous little product. So easy to set up and great sound quality for such a small item! My daughter is thrilled with it in her room, it's smart, compact and we love asking Alexa random questions!"

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,On the Dot,"We received this Echo Dot when we purchased a Ring Doorbell. It's our third Echo device (we also have an Echo and an Echo Show), and like the others, it performs admirably. And I was pleasantly surprised with the sound quality, given that it's such a small device. If you're looking to stick your toe into the Echo waters, and don't want to spend a lot of the money your first time out, the Dot is a great place to start."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,How did I survive without them,"I recently received an Echo Dot (2nd generation) as a gift. I instantly saw the value, but wanted something a little bigger for the sound. I bought two more Echo Dots (3rd generation) and the Echo Plus. We now have four smart rooms. You'll want to avoid having friends named Alexa or talking about her on the phone."
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Great sound from little speaker!,"Bought this 3rd gen dot as an addition to the 2nd generation I already have. This 3rd generation is MUCH better than the other dot. It has a far superior sound ,better base.Super easy to set up.Also bought the Amazon fire stick,great addition to my Amazon family. Even better as I paid half price in the Black Friday deals. I highly recommend it."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Very Smart! Great Companion too!,"It came included with my Fire TV. Alexa is actually very smart. She wakes me up by setting an alarm, tells me the weather, keeps me updated with NFL scores, etc. Also, compatible with my Apple Music and Sirius XM."
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Loving my Echo dot,Having only had this a week I am very much a novice and still learning about the many things that you can do. Connecting was very easy and Alexa was soon playing the songs and music I requested. The tone is really good but you do have the added cost of Amazon music or Spotify. Have tried asking lots of questions and tried a couple of quizzes. Looking forward to trying more. Would recommend
5.0,a year ago,Argos,My amazing Echo Dot,"I actually was happy with the price to begin with. My son had bought the echo dot before this one and I was in love the easy access to music, news and weather updates. This echo dot is even better the sound quality is amazing for the size. The sound is clear and the volume can fill a big space no problem. I would recommend this product easily no problem."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,My Echo Dot is everything I expected it to be.,"It was so easy to set up, connect to my WiFi and link accounts. The sound quality is really good as I was worried it might not be loud enough if I was entertaining-I didn’t need to worry. Instead of reaching for my phone to research something-I simply ask Alexa. I love it."

4.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Better than 2nd Gen,I have been using the 2nd Gen Dot for a long time and bought this for my living room. The sound quality is greatly improved in this version. I preferred this over Google Home as it has an analog line out for externa speaker but Google Assistant is still better than Alexa.
5.0,9 months ago,Argos,Fantastic gadget!,Bought this for my bedroom after being so pleased with the one I got as a present for Mother's Day and use downstairs. Fantastic sound and very neat. Great for tuning in to my favourite radio stations and my Grandchildren love asking Alexa for jokes and doing quizzes.

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great addition to our daughters room,We purchased this for our daughters room to allow her to take full advantage of Alexa. We have an Echo in our bedroom so this was a nice addition. We also have another daughter in Boston with an Echo and it allows the two of them the ability to chat. Quick set up to home network and to the Alexa app. Highly recommend the product.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Works as advertised, great value","I bought 2 of these on sale to mainly use as an intercom in my house. I have even used it to call home when I can’t get through on my home phone. It does a lot more than this, but that is how I mainly use it. My kids love playing with it, asking Alexa questions or playing music on it. For it’s size it puts out decent sound. Also, it is aesthetically pleasing, but you do have to place it near an outlet for power."
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Much better than previous model Dot,Bought this at a bargain price in November as an early Christmas present for a friend. She is delighted with it - listens to her favourite music all day long. Easy to set up and sound quality is far superior to the Echo Dot second generation. So impressed with this latest version that I went on to buy one for use in my bedroom.
4.0,9 months ago,ebay.com,May be Small but packs a lot of Punch,"Still figuring out my Echo but have been Very pleased so far... I wish the ""What can be done"" information would be more specific. Most of the available skills Alexa is capable of such as controlling the lights in the House or Turning the Thermostat Up or Down, ISNT FREE! But its a ""Cool"" Device to have."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Exceeded Sound Expectations,"The sound quality is MUCH better than I expected from such a small device. The Alexa voice recognition/interaction works pretty well, too. We had the Google Home device before, and it was so bad we just returned it. Only reason we got this one was because it came included with a larger purchase. Definitely recommend."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Excellent value for money,Fantastic Christmas present for my daughter. She's using already. Connected up to her boyfriend's speakers system. The echo dot will need extra speakers to get the full benefit for music.
5.0,a month ago,Currys,JANET's review of Amazon Echo Dot 3rd Generation with Clock - Sandstone,"Pros: Love the clock, so much less intrusive than my old clock radio. Can ask Alexa to set alarm, play music, tell us the weather etc! Cons: Not really, it’s great fun!"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Good to have,"I have to say that ""Alexa"" is better at recognizing than ""Hey, Google Home"". However, there is not much that it can do than google home. The device looks nice in the living room and is fun to play songs and stuffs using it. We have connected few smart things (plugs, bulbs and TV) but we normally use google home mini than this one. When google mini does not hear us then Alexa works like a charm."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Wonderful speaker,As an addition to our Alexa family this Dot is great for entertaining. I can easily take it anywhere there’s a plug. The sound is very clear. Easy to use. Great outside or in the garage to listen to music or check on things.
5.0,a year ago,very.co.uk,Great bit of home help technology,"I wanted a radio for the kitchen. I decided to buy the amazon echo dot 3rd as it has this feature and lots more. It’s a great help for loads of things such as adding to my Morrisons shop order and setting timers plus more. The sound is good, not tinny at all. It was on for a good price with Very.co.uk and being a trusted company, ordering was easy, communication was excellent and delivery arrived super fast."
5.0,4 weeks ago,Argos,Looks great in my bedroon,"I have all Alexa's around my house as I have to say the sound quality is amazing once all linked, but my recent purchase was the echo dot with clock which is amazing, clock feature works just great just download amazon app and 5sec it's all connected, you can set your alarm etc and dim the clock automaticlly at night works just great. And sound quality is Brill highly recommended"
4.0,3 weeks ago,influenster.com,"Love this product, super convenient! So many endless options although i wish the music option was easier to use then it is. I would put an option to just tell Alexa what song to play other than having to identify where and what app to use to play the song, But other then this the product is all around a great product!","Love this product, super convenient!

4.0,a year ago,Office Depot,Making a believer out of me...,"I had a 2nd gen dot that came as a “gimme” with another product. We started to like telling Alexa what to do, and have started setting up our house as more and more of a smart home. The 3rd gen dot is a huge improvement in terms of sound quality and volume. We listen to music and audiobooks a lot, and this is far and away a better product. Also, Alexa is just way too useful."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Love these speakers!,"For a small speaker, this really packs a punch in a room. We have these spread out through the house so we can play music throughout the whole house, or intercom each other in other rooms. Excellent audio quality for a small speaker."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,"Simple, easy to use, actually works, great price!","Affordable, expandable across the house with additional echo family devices. As an alarm clock speaker the sound is surprisingly good, and uses both amazon and Apple Music to play my music. Alexa assistant is very responsive."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,So far so good,"Gave this as a gift. Mostly used to turn off lights. And play music and give a news briefing. Sometimes I think it’s easier to turn the light off like I always have but other than that, it’s been good and convenient. My kids play games and seem to enjoy. This thing can do way more than we have yet to explore since Christmas. I will likely invest to have more in additional rooms."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great for kids,"Not my favorite but a great gift for kids who normally don’t have high expectations from tech devices at a young age. This was bought in that regard as I’d never buy one for myself. Buy a HomePod, there’s a reason they are more expensive, the work and sound amazing."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,I am now an Amazon Echo Faithful!,"I love this thing. I've been wanting an Echo for a long time now. My family all has an Echo and I always see how they use it. If it's learning recipes, listening to music, or getting information, I finally felt it was time to get one. This Echo Dot is extremely helpful."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Every home needs one!,"This was so simplistic in both its set up and design that I really wasn’t expecting much but how wrong was I! The sound is of Cristal quality, it understands the welsh accent perfectly and has great features like being able to connect it to WiFi lights around the home. Really pleased with this purchase!!"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Best version of echo,"When these are on sale, I think they offer the best bang for your buck. I like the way the Bluetooth connectivity works much better than on the full size echo and the sound quality is not bad at all for a small speaker like this. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to anyone wanting to get into the amazon ecosystem."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,New to Alexa,"My sons loves it! Easy setup, still figuring out settings and everything it has to offer. My only complaint is my son has a slight speech impediment and it’s not able to understand him most of the time. Wish it came with amazon unlimited music!"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Sounds great!,The Echo Dot 3rd gen is a big improvement from prior generations. The sound quality is superb compared to 2nd gen. For a bedroom it is of excellent use. I would recommend to replace all 1st and 2nd gen dots to this generation.
4.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Somehow keeping up,"I purchased the first generation Amazon echo dot, it was great for it's time, with Alexa speaking to you, answering questions and playing music. Nevertheless Amazon has upgraded this one immensely, all in good ways with an advanced sound system built in with clear sound quality as well as a beautiful design coming with it, which is instantly eye catching however if you own a XBOX you do not have to use a remote control or Kinect anymore, you can simply say ""Alexa turn on xbox"" or Alexa play forza horizon 4"" it's done very well to keep up with the competitors."
4.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,She Can Be Entertaining as Much as Useful,"My wife, who is not really into gadgets, really gets a lot of use out of Alexa which is saying a lot! We are learning new uses all the time. Yeah, she has her quirks and isn't perfect, but still a pleasure to use for getting instant information about things that pop into our head and want to know."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great product with better sound.,I purchased the Amazon Echo Dot 3rd generation to replace a 2nd generation Dot and I am very please with the sound quality. The other reason for the upgrade is that it comes with more language choices. We are multilingual in my house and the Echo Dot 3rd gen provides me more language options. I am pleased with the Amazon Echo products and hope that these will continue to grow in abilities as I am a technology enthusiast.

5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Much better sound quality than the previous Dot,"I purchased this to put in my main living area, replacing another Dot that I then moved to another room.

5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Excellent Product,"I have eight Echo devices (I think), my girlfriend has four. This is the fourth. I think that speaks for itself. Mainly used for the home automation stuff but we ask them questions, listen to music, etc. The product line just keeps getting better all the time."
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Great Bluetooth capability and quality sound,This little speaker packs a great punch. It’s great for taking out in the backyard to relax with some amplified sound. Also good for use while working out. I love the portability. Great option!
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Perfect starter for smart home,Whether you are just starting out with the Alexa echo system or just want a voice controlled speaker this is perfect. Place it on the end table and control smart lights and get weather updates or whatever else you want to ask Alexa. Or place it in the bathroom for voice control music
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Love em.,I don't put too much burden on Alexa and we seem to get along great. She's controlling some basic light and sound functions at 100% satisfaction. I have two dots running all the time. I even tricked her into helping me play music through my Harmony system.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great addition to the house,"Purchased this for my in-laws to add another device in their house. Now they have three in the house - one in the bedroom, kitchen & office so Alexa is readily available. They love the convenience of controlling lights, music, etc all by voice command & also the ability to broadcast from room to room. Great price and so easy to set up. Highly recommend it."

Next on my list is the Echo Show 8!!!"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Amazon echo is great but has limited skills,"Havnt messed with alexa too much. The idea is great and all but it hasn't really lived up the hype in my honest opinion. Alot of the skills within the Alexa arnt too impressive. Able to connect to my sony smart tv but all it does is turn on, off, and volume. The amazon echo isnt too bad but the skills are limited."
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Amazing product,"Cannot believe I left it so long to join the digital alexa age! Researched other similar products and decided to get an amazon alexa echo, 3rd Gen. Very easy to set up, easy to add free music via mypod and google drive. A great addition to the family and more helpful than the kid's currently are. With the addition of smart plugs its making life a lot easier"
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Love our Echo,Will play music by category but if you want to play a specific song you have to sign up for amazon music. This is 99p for the first 4 months and easy to do. There a lots of other add ons too all seem reasonably cheap. You can google good questions to ask Alexa and have hours of fun with it!
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Plug it up to everything,I love it! Well I havent figured out how to get my kids to stop fighting over her like she's another sibling. She works great and if you have a smart house connect the devices to her. It will help save steps when a lamp is on downstairs. ( all parents will understand)
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Great Product,Simple to set up and easy to add on features like lighting for your home. Wasn’t sure about buying this but my son wanted one for his birthday. We now have three in our home. Signed up for amazon music instead of the free trial subscription Best Buy included.
5.0,a month ago,Argos,So easy to set up,"I was worried about giving this to my daughter as she doesn't have a prime music account but I do, so I downloaded echo app on her phone using my log in and it asks you when setting up who is using it and which room it's in. Works perfectly. I'm not very techy so wasn't sure if I did it right but she's really happy and keeping her entertained"

5.0,a year ago,Argos,DOT,"Bought this as Christmas gift for my husband. It works just like an Echo but has a smaller speaker but it can be paired to you wireless speaker.

I meant my husband is very pleased with it."
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Good tool for senior with vision problems.,I purchased the Echo Dot to assist an elderly friend with vision problems. It has proved very helpful in assisting her with knowing dates and times as reading clocks and watches became impossible. She is enjoying music and asking informational questions.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,"Nice, but not the greatest...",Great product but slightly limited when it comes to other devices. I hate when I tell it to play a song and it isn't part of what it can play out of the box. Still for the price it does what is needed but nothing that would make this stand out amongst the other products on the market.
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Got it for free,"Was pleasantly surprised at how much I like and use this device. Got it for free as part of a promotion for an item I purchased and originally planned to return, but I liked it so much I decided not to return the other item just to keep this one. It’s currently in my bedroom now that I’ve purchased the Echo Show a couple weeks later for the living room."
5.0,4 months ago,very.co.uk,Great if you can think what to use it for,Great little product. We used it a lot at first.. hardly do now! Great if I’m out and want to call home. Great for music if u have amazon / Apple Music. My daughter plays the animal game. Other than that we don’t really use it but it’s worth the money
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Product,The Amazon Echo Dot is a wonderful product for a bedroom. I purchased one for my daughter to use in her room and she loves it. It's easy to set up and there are many useful skills available for it.

I also purchased an Amazon Smart Plug to go along with it which she loves as well.

I can listen to my music in the kitchen/living room now while I ask Alexa to set timers or alarms if I’m cooking. I don’t have a lot of smart home devices so won’t be able to really use the commands but maybe eventually.
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,"3rd gen, nicer sounds","I have had previous 2nd gen units. This 3rd gen is better sound quality. and more importantly, it recognizes our voices over the noise of the kitchen area. All Alexa devices connect up nicely thru the app."
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Amazing Amazon Echo Dot,"I bought the Echo Dot online for store collection, as an extra gift for my teen as her own speakers had passed on to speaker heaven.

5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,"Smart, Portable and Sounds Great","I used to own a Google Hub - not anymore because the Echo Dot is intuitive, smart and portable.

4.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Amazon Alexa and then there's the rest,If you're an Amazon prime user this is the way to go. It's easy to use the commands are understood. Only drawback is.... It's Amazon. Kind of like Apple. Everything works great as long as its Apple. Same applies here.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Awesome brain for smart home,"The Echo Dot has a 3.5mm output jack. I keep it hooked up to my soundbar for bigger sound.

4.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Excellent SMALL addition,"I've been in the Alexa family for a while now, starting with the first generation Echo, then the Echo Show.

5.0,a year ago,Argos,Truly game changing device.,"I took a long time to consider trying Alexa, thinking it just the latest gimmick that we be as useless as Apple’s Siri. But someone told me about the tech in the device and the powerful voice recognition system and I decided I had to try it out. Wow - it honestly is far more advanced than I had expected. It’s a game changer on level with the introduction of the mouse in computers. Seriously- check it out."

3.0,a year ago,Target,Sliced bread is better,Alexa is ok but not the best thing since sliced bread like my grandchildren believe. Maybe Alexa does not speak Grandma. She certainly does not seem to understand what I want most of the time. Normally I give up and revert to the remote (old new school). I even remember how to get out of my chair and manually change the channel (to the horror of the grandchildren). Really?

What a difference a few years makes in the tech! The look of the 3rd gen Dot is also more complementary to the house decor."
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Amazon echo dot 3rd gen.,"The new Dot is fantastic. It sounds a lot better, looks a lot better and is still as cheap as ever. There are no playful colours on offer, and you can no longer power it from a USB power bank, but these are minor quibbles and are somewhat offset by the fact you can use two Dots as a stereo pair and even add an Echo Sub for 2.1 sound"
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,A little mighty Echo,These Echoes are small but versatility and convenient. A nice feature is that with 2 of them you can link them as stereo speakers (just for streaming music services).

I got 4 and when i send messages to 1 of them somehow it goes to #1 and the one i sent the message too. In other words #1 gets everyones messages. Still havent figured it out. I have reset them and set them back up made sure their names are right, everything is right but continues to send copies of all messages to 1 specific echo."

She helps make my home safer by allowing me to turn my lights on without having to have plugs out in the open where my child could potentially get to them.

Only issue was the Amazon Alexa crash on Christmas Day which briefly stopped it from working.

When he is online gaming with his head phones on he does't hear me or notice my texts/calls. I am injured so going up and down the stairs each time is not pleasant.

5.0,9 months ago,Argos,Great sound.,I am using the previous generation as an alarm clock after getting this one. Much better sound and a bit bigger. I highly recommend getting this version when it's on sale for a bargain price. The sound will please all even a part time audiophile like me.
5.0,a month ago,Currys,Carol's review of Amazon Echo Dot 3rd Generation with Clock - Sandstone,Pros: She's very friendly. Clear clock and loud alarms. Cons: I wish you could choose the alarm noises. Also it won't Bluetooth the sound to my phone only the video.
5.0,a year ago,Argos,1st ever Echo product & impressed,"As the title mentions, this is our 1st ever Amazon echo (Alexa) product & quite impressed. I’m not sure how much better the sound is from an echo but this is more than adequate...Very good sound!! This looks much better than the previous (plastic) version, being a lot easier on the eye & the choice of couloirs to go with decor was good! Easy to order, pay & pick up straight away. Recommended."

4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Handy little device.,"I bought this for my sister, but have a few of my own. Alexa is nice to have around and is used more often than i thought it would. It's great for timers', jokes, entertainment weather, news, etc. Sometimes playing music is difficult as Alexa argues with you quite often. I wish I could just say ""Alexa play Duran Duran"", but It's not that easy. Used to be though."
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Nice sound and ease of use,"I love my third generation echo. The sound is crisp and it allows you to connect the Amazon woofer to it for deeper, louder bass. This along my XM subscription means I have great sounding music now at home too."
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,So much fun for entire family!,Like this south we bought 3 more for everyone to enjoy. We even bought one for the garage. My husband says best gift ever. Bought first one in April. Bought more quickly thereafter. Everyone wanted their own.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Very Useful,"At the time when I purchased this, I didn't think I would use it that much but for 25 bucks on black Friday, why not pick it up? I got home and plugged it in immediately! It was very easy to setup and now I have fun using it on a daily basis! I love to wake up and check the weather and ask Alexa to play some classical music while I get dressed for school and/or work! great, useful item! Even at full price!"

5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Awesome Intercom,It is hard not to love the features of Alexa. I just bought a few of them to use in my home as an intercom system and it works great to communicate with my kids in their rooms. They love using it as an alarm and for music. SO many features. It is great!
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Who doesn't love Alexa?,"Loads of fun. Especially for my mom who is visually impaired. She can play trivia games and get the weather and time, etc. by asking Alexa. Sounds kind of corny but it is awesome that she has a way of getting news; weather; time; etc. without having to see it. Love it!"
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,COMMUNICATE!,"Now that I have purchased two of the Echo Dot units, we can talk back and forth from room to room without getting out of our chairs. Being able to use Alexa to message one another makes it easier than ever before to summon assistance when needed for those of us who are not able to move around the house easily. I am thankful for this addition to our lives."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Awesome device for small rooms!,I have this device on each room (2nd floor) of the house and the echo show on the kitchen/family room. Echo dot has great sound for small rooms and is a great addition to echo show since you can drop in on each room from the convenience of the kitchen (1st floor). It works like an intercom and also can make regular calls to cell phones and other echo devices.
5.0,a year ago,Currys,Jean's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 3rd Gen 2018 Charcoal,"Pros: Intercom feature useful. Good sound quality. Cons: Needs very good internet connection or cuts out. Alexa often says ‘I’m sorry, I don’t know that one’ as a reply to a simple command such as ‘Play Radio 2’. Responds better to a Male voice than a Female voice."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Clock and additional alarm features with Alexa,This is better product with excellent features. Wished it did not require to be wired. Charging features would enable to carry Alexa around the house without worrying about finding plugs.
3.0,a year ago,Target,STATIC!!,"Bought primarily as a smart speaker. Awful quality, static comes in/out every other song. Expected much better than drug-store quality. Can't return b/c past 30 days per Target policy. Reviews on Amazon suggest this is a known quality problem. Very disappointing. Will no longer order Amazon items from Target given the reduced return window."
5.0,5 months ago,bt.com,Sharon's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 3rd Gen 2018 Charcoal,Pros: Using sleep sounds at night. Can control hive home system eg lighting. I can listen to my Amazon Prime music. Links with my other Amazon Echos. Cons: Nothing that I can think of.
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Great upgrade,This is a substantial upgrade towards the previous generation. The speaker is much better than the previous and is also more responsive. A great addition for use in my bathroom to listen to news and music. I’d highly recommend it.
4.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Good,"Good product, especially at the sale price of $25. Great for music and quick information when needed. Speaker could be stronger, but for the price and size not too much to complain about. Will add more to the review once I utilize more of the smart home functionality."
5.0,a year ago,very.co.uk,Great value and really useful product,"I have had an echo first gen for sometime now and bought this new echo dot 3rd gen to compliment it.

5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Always need another one,"We bought this Dot, our 3rd, to keep in the bedroom. Excellent sound for such a small speaker. My wife loves to listen to music on it while getting ready for her day. She even uses it to turn the lights on and off in the living room."
5.0,a week ago,Best Buy,Great speaker for its size!,"I bought the Echo Dot to use mainly as an alarm and it works wonderfully. Voices with a lower register don't project very well, but I didn't buy it to listen to people talk. Music plays fine and the morning routine has been very helpful in waking me up!"

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great as a Gift!,"I have five of these in the house, I never thought I would have one! I got this for my mother because she would never turn the light on in the middle of the night if she had to get around because the switch was out of the way, I feared she could trip on something and get hurt (she is 76). At first she thought it was such an odd thing, but now she asks Alexa for news, weather, the time, and she turns the lights on with her voice! I am so glad I was able to help her in this way, I have much less worry now!"
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,She makes the family happy,"She is really the V.A lf the family. She keeps my toddler entertained, I do my workouts with her and she controls my TV for me. She is pure awsome sauce. I am also excited about the Alexa guard feature that has rolled out as well. Pure peace of mind."
4.0,a month ago,influenster.com,She randomly comes on when we don't say Alexa and says random stuff. One time while we were watching game of thrones.

5.0,a month ago,Argos,Does what it says,Does exactly what it’s meant to do. Easy to get started with if you follow the Alexa app. Only problem I’ve found after a couple of days uses; it doesn’t always know where it is; so can give rather curious weather reports. I’m sure the more I use it the more accurate it will get
5.0,a month ago,bestbuy.ca,Love this product!,"Setup was simple, and the Echo Dot does exactly what it says. The clock feature is great because I don't have one in my livingroom. I will be ordering another one for the bedroom. I wish the speakers had a bit more bass, but that's neither here nor there."
5.0,4 weeks ago,Best Buy,Fun device,"This was my first experience with this type of device. I'm not a techie, so my son had to set it up for me. I also purchased a Sengled bulb because I hate having to find my way to the bed in the dark. This was a real blessing and so easy! I'm enjoying the interaction with Alexa."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Perfect for kids,My kids love the Alexa we have and always go back and forth with asking it to play different songs. We bought two of these for their rooms and now there is no more arguing! The sound is pretty nice too compared to the higher priced Alexa.
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Great for handsfree directions,I love the echo dot 3 rd generation. It helps you to call contacts for you hands free or drop in to tell someone you need something. It can play music and even give you recipes for dinner. I’m ready to buy another one after getting this one.

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Super Awesome,"So we've become slightly addicted to Alexa in our house. This is our 4th Echo-type device. I like what this compact piece of gear brings. While not as loud as our full-size Echoes or Echo Show, this thing has some decent sound. Looks great too. Super awesome being able to control Hue light bulbs with your voice."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Works Great as intercom system,I have a few of these scattered throughout the house and they make great intercoms between them. They also have new features being added to them everyday it seems like. Fun toy as well as a great tool.

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great device and easy to install,"Pros: Got this in the black Friday sale at a bargain price. Originally had it in my living room but have since bought an echo so the dot now lives in my bedroom. Great sound quality but it does crackle slightly at full volume. I love all of the features, especially sleep sounds which I use most nights to help me drift off to sleep"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Excellent,"Its better than the Gen2. I have the Echo Dot Gen2 and Gen3 playing out of a/v receiver. The Gen 2 has a slow response compared to the Gen3. When my ring doorbell detects motion before my phone can say anything that Gen3 has already said it, then my phone then the Gen2 Echo dot. Music of voice prompts sounds awesome with the changes to speaker placement. love it"
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Worth the purchase,I never thought I’d like having this in a small apartment but it works great for everyday things. The accessories are definitely worth it too when you bundle them. I purchased the wifi plug and wifi bulb which both work super well with the echo dot.

I hear its kind of the same deal with the sub. Im tempted to return one of them since the use as a pair is pretty limited.I thought maybe I could just use a few Sonos One, but they cant do timed actions like alarms.Edit:Impressively, I posted this review in the morning and Amazon called to discuss it with me that afternoon to see what feedback I had on the Dots.I was pretty impressed that they are that on top of their reviews.Less","Just bought 2 of these.Ive had a few 2nd generation Echo dots around my house for a year now.I was interested in the new dot both for the improved sound as well as the stereo pairing.The sound is indeed significantly better, perhaps almost rivaling my Google Home.They are much louder as well.I would have skipped getting the pair.Pairing them as a pair was pretty simple.They will only both play though if you ask them to play something off a service like Amazon Music or Spotify.I often use one of the sleep sounds Alexa skills at night and figured having a speaker on each side of my bed would create a more enveloping sound.Unfortunately, it only plays out of 1 speaker.Also, if I ask it to play a radio station it will play out of both speakers, but when I use it to wake me up in the morning with that same station it only plays out of one.

4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Free Black Friday,Got it free with the ring floodlight on Black Friday. Basically only use for playing music and generating shopping lists but still handy. My nephews (ages 6 & 8) figured out the Alexa will do their homework if the ask her. Lol. “Alexa what’s 2 times 4”.

5.0,2 weeks ago,Currys,Anonymous's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 3rd Gen 2018 Charcoal,Pros: Such good sound from the dot. Cons: I have been charged £9.99 for Amazon music when I have not requested this music but Amazon refunded same which was ok.

4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Echo Dot,My family is enjoying them very much. My mother enjoys listening to Glenn Miller on her echo and it’s easy for her to operate. For myself I don’t particular like that it can listen in on conversations. Just don’t say anything you wouldn’t say in public.

4.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Love them when they are connected,I’m still trying to get all of mine to play the same station throughout the house. I hate when I have an outage or they do work on the lines because it’s a pain to go throughout the house and reconnect all of them. One of these days I will learn how to have them all playing the same music

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Sound Quality is Greaat,When I set this up for a friend I had to look at the box to see if it was a real echo dot. I have several around the house that sound tinny but this one is totally different. The one in the living space is connected to the sound system at low volume and sounds ok but the sound system stays on all the time. You really don't need a seperate sound system or speakers with this.

4.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Good but not great,"This came free with our Ring camera, so we set it up with our echo show to play music everywhere. The sound quality wasn’t great if the volume was too high. Overall nice product and works well for functions other than turning up music."

Soon I will have this in every room of my home. Great product."

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Excellant addition to original Alexa Plus (Gen 2),This was purchased as an addition to the full size Alexa Plus Gen2. Although the Echo Dot was a Gen3 it works flawlessly with the original one. Will probably purchase a couple more for our use around the house. Already purchased three additional ones for gifts for the grandchildren. Great item for the price!
4.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Its Fine,"This is my first echo dot and its pretty okay. I can link all my music from spotify and pandora effortless. The only issue i have with it is the alarm.

They are improving all the time and this unit completely exceeded my expectations."

He constantly asks the same questions over and over again, which is normal except that he gets embarrassed because he continually asks the same questions.

Just say “Alexa, show me the front door.” Also, you can connect it to lots of smart home devices such as a Nest Thermostat. Use the Alexa app to learn and do more with the Echo Dot."
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,great product,Great product love all the features of it. Makes life really easy. answers all of my questions and give results instantaneously. I can't live with out it . I which I had bought one sooner. Works with all of my smart devices that are compatible
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Just what the household needed!,"Great addition to the household, especially now daughter has left home & me & the hubby aren’t very good with technology. This was so easy to set up & use. I use it for just about anything from recipes to my favourite playlists."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Alexa rocks,"I love this product. My partner and I use it every day. The only (little) trouble I've had is some times I have to rephrase some things so Alexa understands me. Other than that, it's the funnest Christmas toy I've gotten to play with as an adult."
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Good product,Bought this to use with our Sonos system. Works well to instruct playing different types of music on all our speakers. Doesnt take up much room so perfect for our use. The actual speaker on its own has a good sound quality. Handy product but being old fashioned I still like to look things up for myself.
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Exactly what you'd expect,"If you're looking to buy one of these then you almost certainly know what it is, what it does and how well it does it! And yes, it does what it says on the tin. If you're not sure what it is or how well it does it, you'd probably best Google some more in-depth reviews before deciding between the Alexa Echo Dot and the Google Nest Mini."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great device,"It is very easy to setup and operate and our whole family has enjoyed using it. The sound quality is really good and I have been impressed by how far away I can stand and speak in a normal voice and it still hears me, there has been times when it does not respond or another Dot from another room responds, overall it works well. When you activate a skill you do have to pay attention to the exact language that you need to use to activate the skill, what you name it."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great purchase for someone who isn't tech savvy!,The Echo Dot has proven to be a source of pleasure in my home. My trepidation about this purchase increased because I was unsure if I could set up the device easily. My fears abated quickly though. The Dot is an easy set-up and can be accomplished in a matter of minutes. It is with great confidence that I recommend this product.

5.0,4 months ago,ebay.com,Everyone should have one,"I love this product. The device is compact and smart looking. Its taken me a while to adapt to asking Alexa to play music or answer a question, as opposed to searching on my tablet but this is much easier. Everyone uses it now."

4.0,a year ago,Argos,It’s okay,"It’s okay. Before purchasing this product we researched what music could be used free, however it seems that you need to pay for a premium music app as the free basic one no longer worked on this version. Not sure if our research was duff but hopefully I will manage to connect to my phone Music to solve this. Also the setup wasn’t quick as didn’t auto connect but get there eventually. Time will tell if vfm"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great addition to the Echo family,"I got this free with the purchase of a Blink XT camera - and I was ready to dismiss it since I have a house full of Echo Dot v2 devices. However, i set this bad boy up and was pleasantly surprised at the higher quality audio it puts out. The device is also about 15% larger than a v1 or v2 Dot, and it uses a different power dongle (a larger wall-wart, non-USB...similar to the type for the Spot)."

4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Like it but still fear this is the road to Skynet,So far the kids love to torture Alexa asking her to play music and if she likes Siri. So far she is just a glorified weather box. We unplug when we don't use; just not ready to have Amazon always listening. That's how Skynet starts!

5.0,a year ago,Argos,Amazing sound,"Heard they were good but didn't expect them to be this good, amazing sound from such a small speaker system. Easy to set up and use, has lots of skills to enable, I like the burglar deterant which creates a busy environment and sounds like the house is alive with the normal day to day chores. Far too many pluses to write here. Get one, you will not be disappointed with your purchase."
5.0,2 months ago,lowes.com,Great sound and performance in a small package,I already had an echo show and an echo alexa (full size) and got the dot to add fuctionality to a basement office.

4.0,a month ago,Currys,R's review of Amazon Echo Dot 3rd Generation with Clock - Sandstone,Pros: Good but often not used for anything more than a clock.Maybe if more use depending on how many smart devices in your own house that can integrate with it. ?? Cons: Better than the original but still not worth it for full price.
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Fun toy, not for an audiophile","It can be quite entertaining to ask Alexa random questions. I primarily us it for playing Pandora music in my garage. The sound quality leaves a lot to be desired but it is functional. I would assume the bigger, more expensive units might have better sound quality. If so, maybe worth the added expense."
5.0,10 months ago,Argos,Does exactly what it says.,"This is simply a great piece of kit, you can play virtually any song from the internet or from your library, the sound quality is fantastic especially for a small speaker!

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,So much better than the original Echo Dot,I received this as free gift and wasn't really shopping for it. But now that I have it I love it.

The microphones seem to have been improved too and recognize my voice over background noise better also.

Now, for under $30, I have Alexa and a great sounding speaker. I used a cable instead of bluetooth for the connection because my Bose does not have bluetooth. No issues as of now. p.s.

4.0,a year ago,Argos,These are great!,"The improved speaker on the 3rd gen is definitely noticeable and worth the investment if you play a lot of music. The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is firstly between the 2nd and 3rd gen dots the only difference is the improved speaker so your really just paying the extra money for the speaker and secondly they have changed the usb plug and cable to a hard wired plug, which if like me you’ve changed your wall sockets to ones with usb points then it’s a bit of an irritation!"

4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,First echo dot,"This is the first Amazon Echo Dot that I have purchased. I like to use it for basic things like checking the weather and asking questions about things that I would otherwise would have had to look up. I haven't used it to hook up to any smart devices, at least not yet. It works well. Pretty decent sound for a small speaker."

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Large improvement from the last one,The newest version of the dot doesn’t seem as cheap and disposable as the last one. This unit is good looking and appears to be a little larger in height and width than the last also. The biggest improvement is the speaker. It sounds 10 times better and even is able to play some lower bass tones now!

5.0,2 weeks ago,Best Buy,Bought as a present,"Bought this a present for my aunt for half the cost. I like that it's pretty versatile on the demographics--you can give it to a coworker, a cousin, your aunt/uncle, or even grandparents. It's a pretty user friendly device that can be given to anyone."
5.0,3 weeks ago,influenster.com,Alexa is really great though I don't use as many of the features as I can. I use it often to control the TV and Lights for bedrooms.

4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Fun and useful. But one was defective,"Bought two Echo Dots. They are easy to set up and use and I enjoy all their features and capabilities. However, the speaker went bad on one of mine within a month. Fortunately, Best Buy gave me a full refund. But now they are back ordered and I can’t get a replacement anytime soon."
4.0,5 months ago,Argos,Beware,"If you are buying this for a second room, be aware that Amazon rips you off to play music. If you have one already, you pay £3.99 month for music.. if you add a second speaker for another room, they charge you £9.99 month. Doesn't seem right, especially as you are buying their equipment to play it on."
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Unified Home,"Great helper for all the rooms in the house. Provides an intercom system throughout the house. Allows music to be synced and announcements heard by everyone. Helps with recipes, homework, forecast etc. without lifting a finger."
5.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Love my Ech Dot,"I was hesitant to buy an Ech Dot, but friends convinced me to buy one. I just have to say, why didn’t I buy one a long time ago? I wanted it for the music, but I have so much fun with it for other things. I’m still learning all I can do with it, but Alexa tells me when she doesn’t understand!"
5.0,a month ago,Target,Works great for us!,"Bought this echo dot for my husband for Christmas and it was such a hit! We placed it on our kitchen counter, and Alexa is able to hear us all the way from the living room. We hooked our Roomba, a lamp and a fan up to it and it functions smoothly. I am enjoying having it!"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Small but big sound.,"This 3rd generation Echo Dot is nice & compact. It doesn’t take up a lot of room on my living room side table. Although it’s compact, the sound it emits is great! I’ve had this a few days so I’m getting used to it. But I really like it & I continue to learn more on its many uses. Plus this holiday pricing really made me take the jump & buy this."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Kinda fun,We have been hesitant to have a device in the house constantly listening to us. It kind of creeps us out. But we finally caved and bought one. Its most useful feature is playing music. Although the grocery list feature is nice. It doesn't always recognize that you're trying to get its attention. We find ourselves yelling at it sometimes.
5.0,a year ago,Target,Great product at great price,"This is our second purchase of the 3rd generation dot. Sound quality is quite good. We like it since we can control our oven, thermostat and security system. It makes creating shopping lists a breeze. The device is very responsive to commands. It’s probably the premier home assistant."
4.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Four stars because of listening,"I like the Alexa. It’s easy to use and speaks great. I just don’t like that I have to repeat my saying when I request some music artists. Alexa is fun to use when you pay for extra trivia, games and quizzes. Great item."

Especially when you have family over and can’t figure out who is right when a question is asked, all you have to do is ask alexa. It can be used for anything.

5.0,a month ago,Argos,Got this alexa for my son for cheistmas,Got an alexa for one of my son's christmas presents. He loves it. It was so easy to set up and it sounds great. I loved it that much i brought another one for myself. Would highly recommed one of these!!!!
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Good size,"This has been my first venture into the Alexa product. I ended up getting 8 of these plus a couple Echo Plus units. I like the color, but the size is great when you want it in a room but don't want it setting out in the open taking away from the decor of the room. The color blends in well with most stuff but the unit is small enough to be able to hide it behind a lamp or other fixture."
5.0,6 months ago,Argos,Great home addition,Bought this for my 4 year old daughter as she kept pestering as she has been in other homes with one. She loves asking Alexa questions and to play her favourite songs. Only bad thing is another wire to try and hide.
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Lots of fun and amusement,"Plays music, tells jokes, gives you a quiz, the weather and the temperature along with lots of other functions. It is especially useful if you can't spell a word as it will spell it for you. I liked it so much i bought two more for Christmas presents."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Best Gift,"This was a Christmas gift for a friend. Everytime my friend discovers another thing that the Echo can do, there is so much expressed excitment. The Echo has been paired with a switch that allows control of other electrical applicances. My friend absolutely loves this feature. For the price and functionality, you can not go wrong."
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,excellent speaker,This speaker has a great deal of volume and base. Its like having music throughout your home. I love this little speaker and plan to buy more. The design is unique and very modern. I can place at anywhere in the room.
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Great starter device,Amazon had run out of these.To be honest it was quicker than waiting for delivery and the guy on the counter was very helpful.I got this because my lodger keeps leaving everything on so i can turn them off without moving from bed { im disabled} It works flawlessly and very quickly. I haven't had chance to investigate its other functions but i listen to the radio a lot and the sound quality is excellent. I find the voice control very useful in running the house and i wouldn't be without it now.
4.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,great sound,Playing music on the third generation echo dot is great. It sound really good. I play Iheart radio and amazon prime music on the echo dot a lot. You can also link them together to play the music throughout your home.
4.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,It’s works but limited,I have Alexa and google home.. I prefer saying Alexa more the hey google! Lol but the google home works a little better with my smart lights. The echo for is cool and does a lot the sound is decent for a small speaker..
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Works Well And Are Great Gifts,"I've had a couple of these in use, for nearly two years. They are easy to set up and use. The longer you have them, the more you use them. Their capabilities are amazing. The people I have given them to, as gifts are amazed; too. They have all thanked me, for such a thoughtful, usable gift. They were unaware, of all they can do."
5.0,8 months ago,ebay.com,this was a good deal and alexa is fun to be around!!,this speaker has good sound even for streaming music.. alexa is easy to understand and it responds to commands rapidly .. i liked it so much i bought a second one to put in a different room and plan to connect the tv and lights so alexa will help out there also.
4.0,a month ago,Argos,Great,"Great product. Only problem is trying to connect it to the amount of things we have (TV, sky, apple TV, xbox one, ps4, soundbar, Phillips hue bulbs throughout living room and bedrooms) Just wish amazon music wasn't to pay for music request wise Pros- convienient Interesting facts, Fun to use Cons - initial full set up for multiple devices tricky"
5.0,a year ago,Target,Amazing,"I absolutely love the echo dot. The speaker is loud. Alexa, she is wonderful. She wakes me up on weekdays. Gives me the weather. Plays songs from amazon music and even tells me the traffic before I go to work. I can also call people in my contacts. I absolutely LOVE MY ECHO DOT!"
5.0,4 months ago,Argos,Eco dot becoming invaluable,"My partner has had a head injury, and therefore has serious memory loss. Alexa great when asked, what we think -as simple things as time and date, to adding things for shopping list, and reminders for medications. Become invaluable for someone who is confused"

2.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Best buy wouldn't provide it,"Bought ring camera and this came free for purchase. The dot wasn't available when ring was picked up. Came available 4 days later, I was out of town working and wouldn't get back until day later. They denied me the product 6 hours after closing doors previous night. Spoke with store manager and customer service and they wouldn't give it to me."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,I like free,Got it free with the ring floodlight on Black Friday. Basically only use for playing music and generating shopping lists but still handy. My nephews (ages 6 & 8) figured out the Alexa will do their homework if the ask her. Lol. “Alexa what’s 2 times 4”.
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Good product,"I enjoy using it as an alarm, listening to music, and the news. Sometimes she doesnt do the same thing with the same instructions given to her prior. However, its worth the money for other smart devices hooked up in the house."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Nice Product,"I purchased the Ring and this came as a free offer. I gave it a 4 star rating because I have only used it for basic functions like checking the weather, playing music from my phone, and receiving alerts from my Ring system. The music sound quality is good. Since I have not used most of the features, it's hard to rate it higher. Easy to setup."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Excellent value for money,"Absolutely brilliant. Once the initial set up was done, it was really easy to use. Set up was done through the app and there was only one part of It that wasn’t very clear, but, other than that, it’s excellent. Would definitely recommend."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,I Got A Great Deal ON Two Echo's 3rd Gen,"I am practically new to this technology scene however, a quick learner. I received a deal on two. It was easy to set up and it does everything they say it can do. I am enjoying maintaining grocery list, checking on kids when not home with drop in feature, and using like an intercom communicating with family in other areas of the house. I need more."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Very convenient,"It is very convenient to have once you get used to it. You can ask it the weather, have it play music, or ask general questions. You can also set up smart home features. It does a pretty good job of understanding normal speech, so you don't have to memorize some set of command words, but it is not 100% accurate and may be frustrating sometimes."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Very convincing,I have had absolutely nothing but good luck with my Alexa system. I’ve gotten it designed so it becomes an intercom system between all three floors in my house. My only wish would be that there was a quick look tired that came with Alexa explaining all its features. The app is great but I think it would be very helpful to have a quick guide laminated to be capped near the device
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Wayyy beyond the original dot!,"The speakers in this new dot are truly worth listening to music through. The sound is more than just tolerable and you can team up a pair of them to get stereo sound if you want. I found it better to use the alexa app to crank up the treble to max and also substantially increase the mid-range. It's still a bit bassy, but unbeatable for the money."
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Nice little upgrade,"I wanted to replace the gen 1 dot I had in my living room and I was pleased with the time I had using it, but I knew there were new features and designs of the new generation that would make my home life a little bit easier. Never anything to complain about with this product and I would continue to purchase future models when it's time."

I bought another with a clock embeddded, don’t bother this is better. Cons: Nothing"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,"Great device, sound quality is good as well.","I know some people are wary about devices like these, I don't care. I use to to play music, guard my house when I leave, and to play sounds to help me sleep at night. Sound quality is surprisingly good and I would buy it again."
3.0,a week ago,Best Buy,Good value for the dough.,"Only complaint is sound quality. Operation instructions —- very minimal— so went on line. But very handy. Bought a rechargeable battery echo plugs into, so unit can be carried from room to room."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Keeps me scheduled,"I enjoy this little device and ""she"" helps me with my scheduling, keeps my grandchildren entertained and allows me to use the various features of smart-home applications such as controlling lights, music, temperature, etc. The gen.3 was a good buy for the money and it does sound better in the playing of music than theearlier generations."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,It's like a beacon for the kids...,"Good product. Although we have not used the product to its fullest, we got a peak during a visit with one of our friends. The one thing we did note was how alluring it is for the kids. They want to ask Alexa everything! This product is a game changer as it relates to convenience. The home automation aspects are just awesome!"

Cons: Considering the price and that its 3rd gen - I would expect much better sound quality.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Better than the original Echo dot,Got this for free with a purchase I made and I have to say I am pleasantly surprised at the sound of this compared to the first gen echo dot. I have 23 of the first gen echo dots and have them all plugged into an external speaker. The sound is good enough for me and loud enough for me that I don't feel I need to do this with this current gen echo dot. Nice improvements amazon.
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Bought for my brother,"I have Alexa, I love her! I told my brother he needed one. He's kind of a pain sometimes. LOL! I bought him one for 4th of July present, had it delivered, he loves it! Big sisters know best! Thanks!"
4.0,a year ago,Office Depot,Great purchase,I was debating between this and the regular echo. I've had both and we both know what the echo does so all I'll talk about is the sound quality. I'm going to get to the chase. This is the BEST speaker I've ever heard for under $50. The functions of the echo along with the music playing functionality and the sound quality makes it a steal at this price point.

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Awesome!,I'm fairly new to the smart home market and thought it would be a good start in my bedroom.

The music quizzes are fun and listening to Audible is great. Highly recommend Miss Alexa.
5.0,3 months ago,Argos,The Echo Dot is a great piece of kit.,The Echo Dot is good value at the sale price. It sounds great for it’s size and is relatively easy to set up. Maybe they should include an onboard clock so you don’t to wake everyone asking for a time read out at night! Recommend.

3.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,I keep hearing negative things about these.,I bought 2 of these but have not used them. I keep hearing how other people are listening in on them. Don't like that. I should have taken them back to the store. I rated as average because I really have not tried them out so don't want to rate them as poor.
5.0,6 days ago,Argos,Brilliant home player,Got this so my daughter would have something to play music in the sitting room instead of using my phone or any other device to play music it's such an ease to use! And so helpful around the house! Now only need to get a few more for the different rooms!
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,AWESOME!,"Overall I am completely satisfied with this smart in-home device! I can stream Amazon Music, control my smart home devices (LED light bulbs), etc with Amazon Alexa. I have other Amazon products including the Echo Show 5 and the Echo speakers."

5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Improved Sound Over the 2nd Generation Dot,"Often on sale, the Generation 3 Echo Dot provides great value for the cost.

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Awesome Device,"My son got me this for Christmas and I told him I would never use it. He refused to take it back and told me to keep it for a month and if I still didn't want it he would return it. It is awesome! I have Alexa doing everything for me from turning on lights, setting timers, telling jokes but the best part is being able to play music (any song you want) and the speaker is unbelievable for the price. Highly recommend!"
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Cool device,Bought this not really Knowing what it does but due to the constant bombardment of tv advertising before xmas thought it might be a good present. I'm pleased now that I paid some attention to the marketing. The dot is a brilliant little device. Sound quality is really good for such a small speaker and there's lots more to discover with it.
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Great product - complete voice control,"Great product to complement and already growing smart home. The skills available are great, even if they do take a bit of time to setup.

5.0,a month ago,Argos,"Perfect, looks good and very helpful!","Looks good and goes with the modern style of the living room and even though 10 is as loud as it will go, it’s still quite loud! Easy and fast to set up, even to start your subscription with Amazon Music. So helpful, instead of just searching, we now just ask Alexa!"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Love my Alexa!!,"OMG!! These things are the greatest since sliced bread! If your hands are always busy and you need another you, you need an Alexa! The only thing this little dot wont do (besdies cook dinner for you) but it will sure tell you how!!"
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great Product - BT connection could be better,"Product itself is great, esp. for the price. Only things that can be improved are: 1) Sound is pretty echo-ey unless its in center of the room, and 2) Bluetooth connection to phone could be better (have to reconnect every time). Thanks!"
5.0,a year ago,Currys,Barry's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 3rd Gen 2018 Charcoal,Pros: Great sound from a wee thing! and Alexa is good fun when she knows things. Lots to learn and lots of aspects to its use. Cons: Sometimes it doesn't understand what I'm saying (Scottish accent) and it seems to have problems re finding a certain radio station but really on the fact of it there really is nothing not to like !
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Great sounding speaker,Excellent sound quality on this product. Very clean hi’s and low’s. Can’t be beat for the price. Alexa is very responsive and quite the dish. What ah dame! Yee haw !!!
5.0,a month ago,Argos,The echo dot is great,"I firstly brought one of these as a gift but after testing it out I ended up buying three in total for myself and my parents. These are great you can do so many things with them, not just play music. But trivia games etc. Great price at the minute."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Very responsive to voice commands,"Gifted this to a older friend who has a strong accent. I was quite surprised that Alexa was able to comprehend his voice instructions so easily. The Echo is almost a ""companion"" for seniors, especially those living alone. They add in to their routine. He texts and emails to family and uses this to assist with spelling."
5.0,9 months ago,Argos,Amazon Echo Dot,"The sound quality is far superior to the older version.The Radio Player skill is a must have,100s of UK radio stations from pop to classic rock. It can be set up online if you haven't got the app on your phone but it is easier with the Alexa App. Get an up to date weather forecast or traffic reports for where you are going."
5.0,3 weeks ago,ebay.com,Usual Alexa Quality,"An excellent product delivering all the Alexa goodies. Only one exception, it comes with an American 2 pin plug necessitating purchase of a US to UK adapter plug. So add an extra 10 or so. Still good value though."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Amazon at your finger tips,"Well, maybe at your voice. I have both the Echo Dot and Google Home. Both are very good products. I will say that I find the Google Home slightly better. I find that it is better at finding answers to a more broad range of questions. But both are suitable for setting up and pairing with smart home features like NEST and Philips Hue."
5.0,3 weeks ago,ebay.com,Love it,Have not found any cons.....Pros...works great. Can receive radio stations crystal clear now. Living in lower Delaware signals are difficult to receive. Love it. Great price and quick delivery.
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Amazing!,I received the Amazon Echo Dot free with my tv purchase on Black Friday. This item has exceeded my expectations and I am mad I didn't purchase one sooner.

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,A good update,"We bought 2 for different parts of the house. The update has much better audio quality, and makes a great intercom system. We use all of our Alexa products on a daily basis for quick information, solve trivia questions, timers, announce dinner and even change channels on the tv. Good buy (or should I say ""Best Buy"")"

5.0,9 months ago,Argos,Love my new AmazonEcho Dot.,Easy to set up and use with any compatible devices. Also because of its discreetness being only small compared to the Amazon Echo that I already have. It hides away well in the bedroom where I use it most. Would definitely recommend.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great sound,We have an echo device in each room with all of them being gen 1 or gen 2. Received this gen 3 Dot as a gift and it’s crazy how much better it sounds from the older models! Works great with the “everywhere” feature when playing music in multiple rooms. Worth the extra few $’s from the older gen models for the sound quality alone
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Definitely recommend.,"I received the Echo Dot as a Christmas present and then gifted my Aunt and Uncle the Alexa Home and Echo Dot since their house is bigger and we both love it. I never thought I could have a ""smart"" home considering I have an older home but I definitely do now. I ask Alexa the weather every morning before work, make shopping lists and turn the lights on and off. It's too cool!"
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Father's Day Gift!,This is a great gift for anyone who likes tech and wants info fast and at hand. Alexa works great and is extremely helpful. I still haven't used smart home bulbs or other tech but I plan to in the future and I'll rely on Alexa to give me a hand with everything.
5.0,9 months ago,Argos,Wow what a great musical device,Fab little device. It is easy to use and very clever. You can program it to turn on and off your TV also you can talk to it to play any tune that you have down loaded. I am glad that I bought it through Argos I did not take a picture of it as it was a gift for my best friend.
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Great value for the overall cost,I bought this as a gift and it was a major hit! It was pretty inexpensive and the sound is great. Overall I think it is a great value for the price—the sound is good and the functions are great for Android users.

5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,More than just a toy!,"Love my Dot - it sits on top of my (white) frig and helps me with recipes and questions in general, in addition to providing radio broadcasts, news, etc. Although the more expensive Echo has better speakers for music, this is perfect for my kitchen location."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Good features, so-so sound","I really like several of the features of the Echo Dot. I enjoy using it to access Amazon Music & running it through my sound bar. I enjoy being able to ask questions for quick answers and I enjoy the ambient sounds available when I go to sleep. However, although the built in speaker has a warm tone, I found it distorts easily."
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Easy to Use!,"We had a google home mini and then we got an Echo Dot free with a Best Buy purchase. We like “Alexa” better. Everyone in our family (5 year old included) is easily able to use this device. If you’re trying to decide on one of the “home” devices, I would say buy this one."
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Love the look,"Love the look, and the sound is so good. The new style is so much better than the 2nd generation one. My husband thinks it looks so much better. The older style looked like a hockey puck lol. I am getting another soon for the bedroom"
5.0,a year ago,Currys,Simon's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 2018 Heather Grey,Pros: Easy to set up! Plays radio stations with no interference. Very clear and volume is amazing for such a little device. Helpful when answering questions. Excellent for reminding family members of appointments that have been set. All in all I would give the echo dot 10/10 Cons: None
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Way better than previous versions,This 3rd gen can ACTUALLY be used as a speaker. The first two generations were only good for voice IMO. But this one packs a bigger size and sound. Honestly its what the first generation should have been to begin with.
5.0,a month ago,Argos,My Echo Dot Is A Great New Design,I am loving my new edition of Amazon Echo Dot. It is much more modern than the old design and the new colours are lovely. I also think it is louder. It is also very easy to set up. I would recommend this product.

Simple and elegant. Great if you buy a lot on Amazon; Alexa will notify you of order progress and updates!
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Great for kids' rooms,"Once we got used to having an Echo, our kids begged to have one in their rooms. This device is perfect as it's easy to set up and fits perfectly in their rooms. Additionally, it's easy for them to move it from room to room or even plug it in outside while they're playing!"
2.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Alexa knows nothing about hockey,I received this free with the purchase of a ring camera. It would probably be good if you could use it for speakerphone. It sounds pretty good for its size. I really only use it to play music for my dogs when I am away from home.
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Excellent Home Item,I purchased this item for all the main rooms in my house and we love it. When we need to talk to one another and we are in different rooms we can just drop into the room of the person we need to talk to and that’s it. Also love managing my lights and other electrics through Alexa.
5.0,4 months ago,ebay.com,Love it! So easy to use. Makes life easier,"I never realized how much the echo can do from asking it a question like will it rain today 2 who went to the Superbowl in 2001 LOL. Makes it easier to do a shopping list, play your favorite music, and more. I recommend this highly to anyone"
5.0,2 months ago,influenster.com,"Realizing I actually have the third Gen and not the second gen but still. Cool little device. I set her to wake me up, tell me my schedule, and turn on the radio.

4.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Good little device,Works amazing only thing is I wish that it was portable. If it had a battery that could be charged that would make this device way more flexible on where I could actually put it to use it. Having to have it constantly connected to a plug in really limits where I can have it.
5.0,3 weeks ago,Best Buy,Great hub for every room!,I have one in each bedroom and one in the kitchen. Great hub for your automation and your music. And works with all kinds of apps! Easy to set up and use right out of the box! Awesome! Great gift to anyone!

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Packs a punch,We had the original first generation dot and liked it fine. This one looks nicer and seems like a great upgrade. It’s got great sound for such a small speaker. Really packs a punch! We’ve paired it with other dots to have house “surround sound.” Great gift. Very happy!
5.0,2 weeks ago,Argos,Brilliant birthday present,We bought for our daughter on her 30th birthday and the whole family think it’s fantastic for music and information. Plenty more to learn to do! If I win the money from Argos I shall buy one for our new kitchen!
3.0,a year ago,Currys,Shezza's review of AMAZON Echo Dot 3rd Gen 2018 Charcoal,"Pros: You can find out anything by asking.Excellent quality of sound Cons: Not so simple getting it to work with your TV and 1 month later I still haven't been able to figure it out. There's very few instructions on what Alexa's echo dot can do.In my opinion I wouldn't waste your money and would simply stick with the ""OK GOOGLE"" search on your phone!Also, it is mains operated only and the lead is quite short which ruins the mobility of the echo dot unit!"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Love this!,The dots have been so improved as far as sound quality that I am very impressed. I ordered two for our kids rooms and then ordered another to replace a 1st generation dot. So much better sound and the entire stup time per dot may have taken 3 minutes.
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Small and neat looking,"Excellent piece of equipment. Good clear sound, speakers work well, very small and portable but works so well. My son had this for Christmas and loves asking Alexa football questions and we managed to get it at a cheaper price so we’re more than happy with it. Contemplating buying another as so impressed with it!"

4.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Neat Adult Gadget,"Really fun and entertaining, very helpful for local info and routines. Could improve how songs are added to playlists.

5.0,4 months ago,John Lewis,Amazon Dot just what we needed,"Bought this product to replace the alarm clock/radio we had. We already have an Amazon Echo and wanted a smaller one for the bedroom. It is just what we needed - radio, alarm and music. Great product."
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,"First there was one, then two, now three!!",Ordered our third Alexa for our room upstairs. Totally enjoy being able to continue the communication around the house.

5.0,9 months ago,Argos,"Easy to set up, great sound.","This 'dot' is so simple to set up. Great price and the sound is loud enough for any room in the home. Plenty of bass for something so small. Lots of family fun to be had with it, not just tunes, facts, quizzes and questions too."

1.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Can't properly rate this item at this time.,"Gave it a rating of 3 stars as a neutral rating. Can't properly review at this time. When I went through set up process, and repeating several times, it kept hooking up to a unknown unsecured network. It never gave me an opportunity to choose my secure network. Obviously I need to call customer service, but I have not taken time to do it as of time of rating."
5.0,9 months ago,Argos,Very effect and helpful,This speaker is si handy for many different things. My little girl loves asking for her favourite songs! I would definitely recommend. I am going to order another one for tbe kitchen!
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Very nice,I was pleasantly surprised at the sound quality. I have Alexa echo so I was skeptical about the dot. Well..the sound quality is really good. Perfect for smaller rooms. I received this one for free as a promotion.
4.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Makes life a little more convenient,"I use this in my bedroom to control my lights, play music, and turn on/off my TV & Xbox. I also ask Alexa about the weather and general questions. I will say though, she has a hard time hearing me over the music sometimes."

4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Okay,These are okay but I can't tell much difference between it and the 2nd generation. I use them mostly for voice control of bulbs and switches. I prefer the 2nd gen. better because they make nice wall mounts for them and if in a garage they resist dirt and dust better. These almost seem like a knock off of Googles similar product.
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Intuitive & impressive sound!,The Amazon Echo Dot 3rd Gen is such a great addition to our home. I received it free as a promotion in purchasing a NEST video doorbell and was simply surprised. The sound (music & podcast / voice) is very impressive for such a small device.

4.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,"Fun toy, possibly able to do more",Not having a smart enabled house setup this is pretty much just an alarm clock and voice activated search engine for me. I'm sure it could do way more if I had other gadgets to connect it with but for now its used to play trivia and answer questions about the weather and let me know when I have things to do.

You get spoiled fast."

4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Good so far.,We have only had the product for a few weeks but seems ok. I wish it came with more information about everything you can do with it. The one thing that we really don’t like about the product is the idea that it is constantly listening to everything. Not sure who actually has access to that information. Worry about it being hacked. We unplug it a lot.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Excellent upgrade over 2nd gen,The 3rd gen has been a nice surprise and blows the 2nd gen away in all ways. Better sound and better build quality.

3.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,It was Free,"I got this free with the purchase of a Ring Doorbell. I had never intended on buying an Echo, I'm not a conspiracy theorist.

5.0,3 weeks ago,ebay.com,Love my echo dots,"Using my echo dots for announcements (even when I'm not home), for weather, question of the day, trivia questions, timers (especially when I have a kitchen timer set for 15 and I go upstairs - I can tell the one in my room to remind me in 10 so I don't miss the kitchen timer). The dot with clock is perfect for the bedroom."
5.0,6 days ago,Argos,Star Trek here we come!,"Super product, mostly easy to set up. A few niggles, soon sorted. Love being able to control my light bulbs and heating with voice commands (Hive controls required for these functions). Great sound from the speaker."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Always Listening,"Received as a free item with my Ring Pro purchase. It works great and is a fun piece of tech, but I do not think I would have purchased this item by itself. I do not have much use for it and I really do not like the fact that it is always on and ""listening"" to everything in the room. I know that an actual person is most likely not listening on the other end, but with all the data breaches going on, can you really be sure?"
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Super fab!!! Kids love it,Fantastic product. Bought two at the same time as it was a Christmas gift for daughter and son. They are both super chuffed!!

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Excellent device,Love this echo dot 3rd generation. Makes life a lot easier and haven't even got to the whole home part of it yet.

4.0,8 months ago,Argos,Dot,"The Dot is fine and works as you would expect, sound quality great, connects great, very easy to set up. My only issue/advice for anybody (hence lost 1 star), although you have to log on using your amazon account, you can then set it that someone else is using it which I did, but after a certain period and lucky as I was around to hear, the dot offered to subscribe to amazon music, you can disable voice purchasing which I did straight away after this, and also found the profanity filter."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great product,Got a great deal on these during holiday pricing ... this 3rd GEN Dot has much better sound quality than our 2nd GEN version. This works well by itself in a small room setting but can also be connected to any existing speaker (via AUX) for better sound quality. Great addition to our Alexa setup in the house.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Excellent,"It came with the Ring doorbell I purchased from best buy. It is very helpful item for the ring doorbell users. It announces that there is some body at your front door or there is motion at the front door, even if the person does not ring the door bell. This item has many other uses besides door bell announcements."
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,User friendly!!,Recieved our Echo as a freebie with a purchase. Thinking about getting another one!! Love how it helps with a busy lifestyle. Hands free is awesome. Doesn't take up much space and is user friendly for the whole family.

5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Well worth it!,"It's PERFECT for listening to music, setting timers, reminders, asking for the weather today, tomorrow or the week. I don't have it hooked up to any smart devices although I know it's great for that. But it's perfect for entertainment!"

5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Learning,This Alexa came as a combo deal with my sons new TV. This is the first Alexa that we’ve had in our home so we’re still trying to get used to how it works. We are from a small town so we’re kind of limited as far as ordering food and groceries with it. He has been using it more as a speaker for now.
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Does the job,"Bought this as a gift for black Friday, the only issue I had was the Alexa app didn't recognize it had a display even though it did. So the display settings were not there but Alexa still responded to some of the commands like to adjust the brightness."

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Better Than Previous Models,Amazon is stepping up their game in home automation and it begins with the Echo line of products. The Echo Dot fits anywhere in your house and is hardly noticeable. It is the hub that will connect almost any of your smart home devices. I also gave one to my mom for Christmas. She has found it easy to use and helpful.

5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great smarthome addition!,We started with the Echo Show in our kitchen and loved it so much that we added 4 of these dots all around the house. It's great how they're all synced and work in unison and can control everything. We'll probably add a couple more with the clock once that item comes back into stock.
5.0,8 months ago,John Lewis,Good quality and great price!,I bought this to go as a speaker in the living room for my music and I’m amazed how good the sound is for the price. Once setup it’s very easy to use and the other functionality really adds to the value of the product. Really couldn’t recommend this enough!
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Looks good and excellent sound quality.,This is very responsive and easy to use.

If you've ever wanted one, it's worth getting and it makes a great addition to my ever growing tech lifestyle."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Better than anticipated,Dot has an excellent speaker for its size & price point. So far it has worked properly. Was very easy to set up and has “learned” my wife’s unique way of addressing it! LOL! Probably going to get a couple more
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,The Eco Dot is doing a great job,Purchased this for an office area to have some music in the background since everyone works in cubicles and not offices.

5.0,a month ago,Argos,Great little device,Excellent device. Sound quality is good and volume can be controlled using voice control. We’ve only used it for music so far but has been good at putting on obscure songs. Would recommend.
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,LOVE ALEXA,I have an echo so the dot is just and extra in another room. I can get information on almost anything I ask. I can get updates on shipments. I can call anyone or answer a call from anyone. The one think I love is I can tell it to play any music by anyone and I have music to listen to anytime.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great clock replacement,I like that the clock isn't overly bright. I can control my lights with the smart plug I purchased along with it. The speaker is a slightly heavy on the bass but the it has great sound quality.
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,A Vast Imporvment Over Gen 2,Louder speaker and sleek design give this a much need modern twist. Love the speaker. I use these to control devices in different rooms of my house and the gen 3 is the best yet! highly recommended.
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great speaker but bass is too strong,Great for music but the bass makes Alexa inaudible. It can be improved a little by reducing the bass level in the Alexa app however I still prefer the 2nd generation over this one for Alexa commands.
4.0,7 months ago,ao.com,I've waited for the price of these to come down which now it has I think they were originally over priced!!

4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Value entry level Alexa,I already have an Echo so reasonably having another echo dot was logical to avoid yelling up and down the stairs and to play the same music on all the groups. Unfortunately sometimes I think Alexa gets confused which device I'm talking to and may get out of sync - I've had to reboot her a few times too much for my liking - but all in all - very pleased with the simplicity of setting up multiple dots in my house and making random announcements which my wife say she actually hears me before the announcement is made - but hey that way I don't have to repeat myself?
5.0,5 months ago,ebay.com,Great product and easy to set up with other echo dot products..,This product works great with another echo dot product and it looks great too. It looks like it is already in its own felt case.. Works with 2nd. Gen echo dot just fine..
2.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Was working fine and one day dead the next,This device was working fine for a while when I noticed it was off. Moved it to a different outlet and never worked again. It aucks that it only has 3 months warranty. So I have to buy a replacement.

Alexa is great for the daily commands of turning my lights on and off, starting my truck, adjusting my smart thermostat, really the sky is the limit with this thing."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Superior Alexa Echo,"I have the second gen echo dots, big echo speaker, and echo show. The speaker in the 3rd gen echo dot destroys all of those.

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,New look,"We have several Alexa Devices with screens, but having the dot is convenient as well. It’s small so it stays out-of-the-way, and there are just some places where you don’t want to have a screen (or camera). It also helps if you use Alexa to play music throughout the house, this is a quick and easy way to add additional listening points. Nice new look as well."

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great! Love It!,We bought the Echo 2 last year for Christmas and have really enjoyed it. When the New Echo 3 came out with a better speaker we had to try it.

5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,MUCH better than the Gen 2,The sound from the new Gen 3 Echo DOT is a huge improvement over the previous model. Sounds good enough to play music without requiring a separate Bluetooth speaker.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Huge step up in sounds from the Gen2 Echo dot,"Very surprising sounds from this unit... Amazon did their homework! I upgraded most of the gen2 echo do'ts to the gen3 version and I'm glad I did, the sound is MUCH better! Much more bass than the previous version and the microphones seem to be a bit better, also! Great job, highly recommened!"
4.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Great Product for Price,"Extremely easy set-up and surprisingly great sound. The design in simple and compelling. The only complaint I have is that Alexa can be pretty dumb sometimes, but as she listens in more often she should improve."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Love Alexa!!,"I finally agreed to submit to our Robot Overlords, and I have yet to be disappointed. The clock dims to barely visible when the lights are out, so it's not shining in your face. You can adjust the volume, and it's got great speakers."

5.0,8 months ago,ebay.com,Quality Built,To begin with the Echo Dot has weight to it which tells me it was made of quality material. It almost programs it self. Easy to work with and we are still learning about all that it will do. You need to buy this product and great to have one for each room.

5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Great sound,This is my first Alexa item. I love all she can do. Its fun finding out all the things I can still do with Alexa. I like the sleep sounds she plays for me when I am restless. Next I want to but the Lenovo smart pad with Alexa dock.
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Can't really go wrong with the Echo dots,"I have two second generation echo dots. This was my first 3rd generation, and there was a noticeable different in sound quality. I have nothing negative to say. I had been so used to the 2nd generation dots that it was a pleasant surprise to come into this one on Black Friday."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Better than i was expecting,The Echo dot turned out to be much more useful than I was expecting. I originally got it for a smart speaker just to stream music but quickly started realizing more potential. I was impressed at how fast Alexa finds answers to your questions and how easy it is to use. I am sure I will like it even more over time as I continue to use it more.
5.0,8 months ago,Argos,Great little gadget,Looks and sounds fab and my son likes the Amazon skills bedtime stories which is free. Some of the other ‘kids skills’ options are tricky to choose and we get error feedback from Alexa. Great for listening to radio though or asking time and weather.
3.0,a month ago,ebay.com,Alexa rocks or can,As a standalone unit the sound quality is a bit limited. Working with an old hi fi amp and set if speakers you get a very credible and useful system. If you want standalone go for the bigger Alexa.
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Great Device,"I use this gadget daily while getting ready for work. I listen to the news and radio, check the weather, and sometimes ask questions. The speaker is great. I got it on sale on Black Friday which was a great deal."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Loud and Entertaining,"The Echo Dot (3rd Generation) is nice and loud, listens pretty well from across the room and has plenty of trick up its sleeves like playing trivia. The only grip I have is when using Bluetooth to connect to another speaker, the Echo Dot becomes a bit static, literally has the sound of a old static TV, while responding."
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Great gadget,"Love how I can connect to this little gadget when I’m not home, near home or even in the same state as home. Great intercom for the house. Integrated perfectly with my ring system and very informative. Can’t wait to get 2 more."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great sound,The only negative I’d read about the dot was the speaker couldn’t compare to the full echo (which is unsurprising considering the size difference). So maybe I was going in expecting the sound to be bad but I was very pleasantly surprised. Music sounds great on the echo and this speech recognition has been fantastic even when I’m around the corner in a different room.
4.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Gift purchase as nice birthday gift,Purchased as a birthday gift for a friend as we were fully satisfied with previous Alexa - Amazon Echo purchases. Will be received and opened in August. They have the full size Echo and will enjoy the Dot version.

5.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,"Not necessary, but lots of fun","Everyone should have Alexia in their house. Way more helpful than a butler or chambermaid, she’s there from early morning to lights out at bedtime. Almost any fact you want to know, she knows it—instantly. Best $29 I ever spent"
4.0,4 months ago,ebay.com,Perfectly acceptable but not groundbreaking,"It's alright. That's as far as I can comment. A little hockey puck of smartish technology, to be honest it's not that great. Average sound & smart tech."
5.0,a month ago,Currys,Gail's review of Amazon Echo Dot 3rd Generation with Clock - Sandstone,Pros: It is amazing. Especially if your alone alexa talks to you to keep you company. I've bought another 3 since for my family they love it too. Cons: None.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Does what it should.,"Rating this as 5 stars because it met my expectations. Nobody should purchase the echo dot expecting it to be a powerhouse of sound. I'm using it in the master bedroom as an extension to my Echo Plus in the living area. It's great for low volume background music, maybe something to help you get to bed, and is very clear. No issues whatsoever."
5.0,3 months ago,Argos,Kids love echo dot,"We bought one as a gift so my brother in law, when we saw how great and easy to use we knew we had to have one for our sleves. The kids love being able to ask the weather, time and for their favourite songs. Sound quality is great too. Very happy with it"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,seems to work great,"I bought the Echo Dot for my 87 year old Mother as a Christmas gift. I haven't given it to her yet, but the setup was easy and it seems like it will do what I want it to do for her. Attaching my phone and making a phone call was simple. The reminders seem to be easy to setup and since you record the reminder, you can be very specific with it. Overall, I believe it will work great for her."
5.0,7 months ago,Argos,Does exactly what it says,Item is fantastic. Only thing I would add is make sure your WiFi is good. Mine isn’t the greatest so lose signal at tiles but that’s nothing to do with the dot. My kids love picking their own songs!
4.0,10 months ago,Argos,Good product,"The only reason I dropped a star is we bought 3 dots and had to return one after a few days when it stopped working. The replacement works fine. Otherwise, it was easy to set up the network of devices and does exactly what we wanted it to."

5.0,a year ago,Argos,Love Alexa,I purchased this for my daughter as we already have one and my daughter loves it. She mainly uses it to listen to music but also it comes in handy when doing her homework. The only downside is when using more than one echo you can’t stream from the same music service at the same time you have to use separate ones like Spotify and amazon music unlimited.
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,"Same old Dot, but with a clock","So I've now retired some gen one and gen two dots, just to consolidate and get rid of clock radios.

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Who knew? Alexa,"When we received the Echo Dot as a present, we had no idea what it was. After fooling around with it, we were just overcome with all the stuff it does.

The new echo dot also sounds way better but I dont use and echo devices for music unless I want a quick listen to some random tune.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great item,This was an update from my 2nd generation echo Dot and I'm glad I got it. It's bigger and looks more appealing with the ring around.

Great fun & great price, I would definitely recommend Alexa."

I can also turn on the music to an additional Dot (1st generation) that we have elsewhere in the house. A great addition to my office.
4.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Not bad for the price..,It has a nice sound for such a small streamlined speaker. Can be picky sometimes when a question is asked or when it comes to wording. Would be better if there was a rechargeable battery as it has to continuously be plugged in.

5.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Updated speaker,The updated speaker makes difference to the sound quality. Good at recognising voice commands. Designed to be switched on all the time as it switches off when unplugged. Makes it a little awkward if you want to move it to another room as you loose what you were listen to.

2.0,a year ago,Argos,"Usually works, but very limited use","Quite often has trouble understanding plain English, other times it's highly obtrusive and responds to audio from the TV. Other than that, this is clearly a first world problem solver for a problem that doesn't exist.

Not as full a range of sound as the full sized echo but for it's price point it's Awesome!

1.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Wiretap/Ease dropping device,"This came free with a Blink Camera offer. Still have it in the box. Dumbfounded anyone would willingly put a ""wiretap"" like this in their home! Rather than even giving it to someone else. Threw it in the trash to be one less home wiretap/ease dropping device in the world!"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Good at controlling things,It's great to control smart home and to do tasks you have to teach it skills for first. Not good at answering questions that your 7 year old asks.

3.0,a year ago,Target,"It may sound better for music, but Alexa's voice is not nearly as clear.",It looks great and the speaker has a much fuller range with more low tones.

5.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Bought to work with ring and lutron caseta,I just purchased this last night to work with my ring and caseta system. I love these new smart home devices. I am a mother of 2 and it’s the little things that free up hands that I am learning to appreciate
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Brilliant little gadget.,"The Echo Dot was fairly easy to set up but, if you only have the one Echo, you have to ask Alexa to sign you up to Amazon Music.It's also cheaper for the one device. Alexa didn't find a couple of bands I wanted but, after asking for particular tracks by each band which Alexa played, I asked for the bands again and Alexa found them. Also use it as my radio now. Very pleased."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Love it!! Alexa is wonderful.,I am very happy with my new toy! Alexa is a fountain of knowledge. My favorite feature is asking Alexa to play music. The quality of the speaker is awesome!
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"A little quirky, but great overall","I primarily use Alexa to control smart bulbs and switches, and for that the echo dot has been great. She will not get all commands right 100% of the time, but I find that when you're having trouble communicating with Alexa, it's best to use a calm, clear, but stern voice to get your point across."
4.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Good for local (not large area ),"Placed this on my patio. It is loud enough to work as a music source for the patio table area, Good sound and bass for close by. Does not have the range and depth of the Show or full size echo but fine for this."
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Did Alexa write this review?,Third dot I have bought. I miss Alexa when I travel. She can control much of my house so I am spoiled. My wife says I a just too lazy to get up an flip the switch get a dot and you will be amazed how much it gets into your life.

If you do not mute alexa the update will take longer because of you asking alexa questions,when alexa is busy it may or may not update within 30 min."

5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,NICE UPGRADE TO THE 1ST GENERATION,Have 3 of these through out the house and like being able to request information from any room. The sound and speaker quality has improved with this generation and it looks better than the earlier models.
4.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Does what it promises.,I use my dot in the bedroom but because the main Alexa is so sensitive it picks up the commands for dot. The Alexa is 3 rooms away. I have to speak quietly right next to my dot or Alexa responds and takes over.

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,a little extra help,"it's nice to have an answer available as soon as you have a question as it leaves you more time to do other things & we really like the fact we can pair our other devices to Echo, like our Ring doorbell, if we are away from our phone or it's off while charging Echo gives a verbal alert so we don't miss anything. We are having fun exploring all the things we can do with Echo."
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Works even in noise,"Was surprised how well this picks out your voice when giving instructions, even when others are talking in a room or music is playing. Does a good job of separating who initiates contact and everyone else."

5.0,a month ago,Argos,Very good for the cheapest echo device.,If you want a smart home device that's not to expensive you should just get the dot because you are getting the same device but it's just quieter than the regular echo.
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Very useful!,I was unsure how much I would use this and if it would be worth the money. It is awesome and I want one in every part of the house. I cannot begin to list the things you can do with it. If you purchase you need to watch YouTube videos of tips and tricks. The sounds is great for such a small device and it looks neat and tidy.

4.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,It’s a fun gimmick for my family,"It came free with my Ring 2 so I set it up on a lark. It sync’d up nicely with my ring 2 and Alexa tells me when I’ve got motion on my porch. That’s all I use it for, my kids like to play with it by randomly asking it questions."
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Echo Dot.,We got this as a free gift bundled with the smart lights. We already had an Echo. But this thing rocks. I love the size and sound. And it picks up your voice really well.
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Great Device,"The echo dot gets the job done, and is surprisingly louder than I thought it was going to be, does not need a separate speaker source if just using in a single room. Over all great product, and smooth setup."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Alexa, write a review.","Having owned both gen 1 and gen 2 echo dot, Amazon has really improved the speaker quality on the gen 3. The same functions you are used to with any Amazon Alexa product but with a much better sounding speaker compared to the older generations."

3.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,meh,The sound quality is pretty good. I got this for free but would otherwise not have purchased. I don't like that it has to be plugged in at all times. The app that is required for setup is not very user friendly.

5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,A lot better in the first generation,I purchased this with the Amazon Music and let me just say this speaker quality is a lot better in the first generation overall it’s pretty much the same thing but the big improvement is the sound not to mention the overall appearance of it is a lot better
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Better than Gen 1/2,We have a gen 1 and 2 Echo dot and so far this seems to work better than those at picking up voices. It's still a challenge for it to pick me up across the room at times especially when there's a lot of background noise. I feel like eventually we will have to add multiple dots to our great room to help with this.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Phenomenal Product,"This item is a great addition to any room in the house. The speaker in and of itself is phenomenal. Great microphone, great sound, and very useful!"

5.0,9 months ago,Argos,Great product but,"A great product that can do a lot of things from calling your contacts to reading the news and learning who you are. The only issue I have is that although the sound quality is good, it could be improved to the same quality as the normal Amazon echo."
3.0,6 months ago,ebay.com,Good introduction to ECHO DOT but pity it is not supported by Amazon in my country,"It does the basic job but am disappointed with the supplier who did not bother to highlight that in fact ECHO DOT is not supported by AMAZON in my country....I cannot install and use the Amazon ECHO DOT app from iOS app store (unavailable) and so I lose much of the functionality that comes with the app e.g. I cannot choose Spotify as my default music streamer, I cannot configure my local address for weather reports etc etc.."
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Super Cool,"Alexa is really easy to set up! I'm still learning about all the things she can do. The little speaker sounds great while playing music, to my ears. Alexa is really helpful so far."

4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Better sound than expected.,"Overall we’ve been pretty happy with this new echo. Has very good Mic pickup and louder than expected sound. BASS is lacking a bit, but it has enough to sound above average. At max volume the speaker does start to get garbled."
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Much improved,I already have a Gen 1 Echo Dot and I am very pleased with it. this Gen 3 Dot is very much improved though I did not expect the improved sound as well as the improved audio pick up of the new unit.

5.0,a year ago,Argos,fun and functional,"Bought for the grandchildren for Christmas. They ask for jokes etc. but has quiz and other educational games so not just fun. Asked the 8 year old what he thinks of it, he said I love it. That sums it up. For adults it is very functional but for kids a lot of fun."
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,nice if you do not want a screen,"We have many of the 1st generations and the speaker on this is 10X better. I like that they are all one color now instead of black and white. Easy to setup, requires app on you phone and wifi."
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Excellent sound quality at a good price!!!,Great connectivity to Wifi and if joined with an Ibox docking station with a built-in speaker for portability you could possibly rock a cookout.
5.0,a year ago,Argos,"Dubious at first, but I was soon won over!","I’m a bit old fashioned, and I find technology too cumbersome these days however, upon receiving this as an unexpected Christmas gift, I have to say that I was quite impressed with how it functions as a speaker (to listen to my music) as well as asking the odd question or two to Alexa — for a digital companion, she doesn’t sound robotic and is surprisingly useful! For those who are a bit weary about these kind of things, I can attest to you that they’re not as bad as I envisioned them to be."

2.0,a year ago,Best Buy,It’s ok,"I had it linked to my Amazon account. After having a few parties, I realized that I kept getting random things added to my watchlist. (I have some friends that think they are funny!) Having it linked to an account could give other people access to it. Overall, I prefer my Google Home."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Product!!!,"Received this as a Christmas present. Put it in my bedroom. I use it as an alarm, to listen to music, to get the weather etc... for such a small item it has an excellent speaker in it. This is an expensive item but you get a lot of bang for your buck!!!! Worth every penny."

3.0,a year ago,very.co.uk,Overrated gadget,Very rarely knows anything. You have to sign up for music subscriptions for it to play anything. Trouble is not all music online subscriptions contain all artists. Playing games on it is fun but as soon as it gets half way it forgets what you are playing and you have to start again.
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,It's Alexa,"What more can I say then, it's Alexa. She listens to everything BUT you can turn her off if you like. We have 3 Alexa units in the house. Two Echo Dots and the larger speaker unit."
