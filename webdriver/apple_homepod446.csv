4.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Could have been a contender,"I waited nearly a year to purchase the HomePod until it went on sale for a not inexpensive, but much more reasonable price for an innovative and well executed speaker design. I took some time to “burn in” the speaker components with a variety of music styles, something done with higher end speakers in expectation of bringing out audio warmth and fidelity. I even placed it in a bay window enclave to act as a sort of speaker horn enclosure so as to enhance the projected sound. Such were my high hopes for how well the HomePod might perform. After all, it had been hyped and compared to higher end stereo equipment due to its genuine technical advances in speaker design. Its WiFi only input maximized the digital music information the advance computer chip could upscale for the multiple speakers calibrated for each personalized listening area. Well, it turns out not to be the aural renaissance of bookshelf audio systems, an unrealistic expectation Apple perpetrated upon itself for this device. Nonetheless, it is a compact and competent sound system that produces music with enough quality to lose yourself in it, absent of harsh or distracting distortions in the musical reproduction. It is a joy to merely ask for whatever song or album comes to mind from memory or suggestion and then be able to listen effortlessly to faithfully reproduced music. That said, and despite being a fan of the Apple ecosystem who harbored high hopes for how well the HomePod would perform, it is evident that it is not, and never will be a high-end bookshelf speaker system that transforms the music from the mundane into some superlative version. Moreover, it is ironic and frustrating that in trying so hard to be more than it is via strict audio source inputs, it is transformed into less than it could be if only Apple would “jailbreak” the HomePod. For starters, it could at least allow Bluetooth 5 audio connections for input. That would unleash it as a top-notch Bluetooth speaker free from depending upon a WiFi network, freely accessing whatever sound sources were available to the listener. A USB-C input would be a cinch winner also, simultaneously inputting audio and charging the audio input device. Yes, I know that would impinge on the revenue stream from Apple Music that is the real money to be made by Apple with the HomePod, but it would enable a moderately high-end audio system and an ultimate midway audio system. It would likely be the preeminent sound system for small-spaces like apartments, dorms, offices, RV’s, work spaces, sheltered exterior spaces, etc. At the same time, doing so would not prevent it serving as the aspirational sound system Apple envisioned. It would dovetail nicely into maximizing their high-dollar X series phones that now have Bluetooth 5, which seemingly allows virtually lossless digital streaming rather the the garbage in, garbage out hyper-compressed digital formats inherent in previous Bluetooth iterations. As it is, the HomePod has garnered a precious small percentage of the smart speaker market as they have virtually required an Apple Music subscription to make use of their speaker. In pursuit of their version of the perfect sound system, Apple has destroyed the very good, and for most customers of a device like this, good enough is perfect. That still leaves the not-so-smart-speaker problem of poor, dear, simple Siri’s incompetence at summoning anything but Apple Music (or most anything else reliably) that severely limits HomePod's utility as a go-to music and other listening device. That one will not go away until Apple develops the in-house talent to build Siri out as seemingly envisioned originally, or the in-house vision to develop her by building out that talent however those billions of earnings might increase product value. Then Siri might just tell me she does not have access to Willie and Lobo in her music catalogue rather than giving me some random Willie Nelson album."
2.0,4 weeks ago,Best Buy,"Excellent sound quality and design, poor software","Poor HomePod. It is the product I want to love desperately because it would really be fantastic if it worked as advertised. The design and physical build quality are fantastic and the sound is amazingly full, rich and vibrant, especially when considering how small it is. The accolades stop there, however. I have encountered two unrelated software bugs that are quite common by the number of postings on Apple's Support site and Reddit. The first issue I had once multi-user support launched in IOS13 is that when I invited another family member to the Home app (both Apple IDs), I would lose owner access and could no longer add other devices, make changes, etc. and the family member invited could not accept. We spent weeks with ""support"" sending logs from devices, etc. only to be told it was a known issue with no ETA for resolution (this is a common theme with Apple support should you ever be unlucky enough to have to contact them). So, being a pretty dedicated Apple fan, I decided that I would manually migrate ALL of my iCloud Drive, mail, contacts, calendars, photos and music to another old Apple ID I had because in testing, that one did not have the issue with my family member and the Home app. Got a new HomePod from BB yesterday, went through set up and discovered it is stuck on version 11.2.5 and would not update to 13.xx which is required to recognize different voices in a household and enable personal requests. After checking Apple Support forums and Reddit, I discovered this is another new bug that has been going on for at least a couple of weeks. Calling Apple Support yielded the same result - nice person who basically checked and verified there was an issue they knew about but again, no ETA or clue on when it would be fixed. So sorry. This is a common theme with a lot of Apple software. When it works, it is like magic. Unfortunately, when it doesn't (and there are a LOT of bugs throughout their product software), they don't care, you can't speak to anyone who can actually fix it and your issue goes into a black hole. You don't get contacted back if and when the issue is resolved - it is up to you to keep testing and checking. Were these inexpensive products or no one else was doing anything similar with smart home devices and multiple users, I would be OK (or more OK anyway) with it. But to pay a high premium for stuff that doesn't always ""just work"" is really annoying. In contrast, if you have ever set up Google Home devices, it is easy, seamless, and they do just work - every time, with multiple family members. I think I have reached the limit of my willingness to invest time and effort into making Apple products work and am now willing to give up a little privacy to have products that work and are much smarter from the competition."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,"Excellent product, sale price should be permanent","I have been intrigued by this product since released, and frustrated with Apple's pricing practices and desire to be a ""top tier"" company by only offering high end high price products. This device always seemed a bit overpriced and unnecessary for me as I have a nice sound system connected to my TV, but I wanted something for Home Kit control. I like Apple's focus on encryption and privacy especially with the alway on always listening home controlling devices like this. I have apple Home Kit enabled devices in my house, and wanted a quick way for my pet sitter to turn them on and off when she comes in. I tried the Amazon dot last year, but found it difficult to setup and you need to have the always listening feature on. It also required setting up my already existing already working HomeKit enabled devices in the Alexa app which was hit and miss. I was waiting and hoping that Apple would release a cheaper version of this with less speaker and more control. Then Best Buy had this on holiday sale for 100 dollars off retail price. I figured it was worth a try knowing I had time to return it if it did not work. I set it up in seconds yesterday, and immediately transferred the podcast I was listening to on my phone to the speaker. I often wear headphones around the house and listen to music or podcasts throughout the day. This makes it easy to transfer what I am listening to via my phone airplay button and I can hear it clearly from anywhere in the downstairs. It sounds amazing and is so much easier to use to listen to anything on my phone. Yes you can use it without the Hey Siri feature listening. You can press and hold the center of the top panel which prompts Siri so I can turn off the ""always listening"" or if it does that annoying digital assistant thing where it mishears something I say that sounds vaguely like ""Hey Siri"" and becomes disruptive (This has not happened yet). I also like that in the Home app on my iPhone I can turn off the Home pod analytics which will not share my always on always listening recordings with Apple or anyone else. I wish the $200 price was not a promotion, but the retail price. After 1.5 days it has proven its worth and made me realize something I was overtly critical of and uninterested in is as good as I was sure it was not. I like being proven wrong. I am not sure I would pay $300 for it at full price, but if it keeps impressing me like this I might eat those words as well."
4.0,8 months ago,bhphotovideo.com,Impressive sound...operation not so much,"I'd actually give this 4.5 stars but can't give it 5. I have both Bose SoundTouch and Sonos in the house - neither of which are classified as Smart speakers, but that's what I prefer since both give me a high degree of playback control from multiple sources - Amazon Music, SiriusXM, Pandora, Spotify, etc., SAN and other external music libraries. Hands down, I like the Sonos app/UI the best, but overall I've always preferred the Bose sound above all else. For the HomePod...I did know it was a smart speaker before I bought it, but wow - I was forced to download the Home app on my iPhone and set up the speaker that way. The Hey Siri is on by default (which I never use, except with Car Play, and even then rarely) - I hate interacting with a telephone IVR system, so imagine my loathing with feeling forced to use Siri. I bought the speaker to play music, not to check the weather or have it automate my lights; having Siri on and being forced to use it OOB was a hurdle to just playing music from my iTunes library. After turning off Siri (who can only play your purchased iTunes music in the cloud, not from other sources - another hurdle), I realized the HomePod became just another AirPlay speaker; I used iTunes to select the HomePod and started playing from my local library...and wow. The sound is impressive! And from such a small speaker...I had it set up in my tiny office, but moved it out to my living room since the sound really filled the space. It's also got some bass to it, which the smaller Sonos speakers definitely lack (Play:1 and Play:3 specifically). I was very pleased with how it handled all music genres I threw at it. So, definitely 4.5 stars for sound quality - the fact that I can't play multiple sources from a central app makes it a fancy AirPlay speaker in my house. I may consider getting a second one to pair them but I'm not comfortable with the whole smart speaker thing due to privacy issues. So, in summary, this speaker has pretty amazing sound at a decent price, but you're forced to use Siri OOB. For anyone else into the whole smart home thing, having Siri enabled would probably be a good match."
4.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Great sound but you must love Apple,"I got this speaker to compliment my Apple TV 4K for traveling. I did not have much interest on it at the $300 price tag. But cyber Monday came around and found it for $200 even at that price I was still not sure about it but I am glad I got it. Pros: sound is very good for the size, easy interaction with other Apple products, it can be used to make and answer phone calls, can be paired with a second HomePod and linked for better sound or multiple room configuration. You can have Siri read or send texts for you. Ambient sounds available in the speaker no need to install nothing. Multiple user voice recognition, plug and play. You can use the HomePod to control smart home devices, love the looks and it’s stylish. Very advanced technology for a speaker. Now the Cons: its a heavy speaker for the size, no external jacks available, power cord is permanently attached, even if Siri has improved since the speaker was first introduced it does still need a lot of work as a personal assistant. It works with Apple Music if you want other music platforms you will need to use an iPhone or iPad to AirPlay that music, that also brings me to the biggest con, NO BLUETOOTH you need an iPhone or IPad to connect to it. If you are an android user I don’t recommend it but if you love Apple products like I do it’s a great addition to your Apple universe. All in all it works great as a speaker with very nice quality sound and interacts great with other Apple products. As a smart/assistant speaker; well I love Siri but she needs more attention by Apple. I hope Apple keeps doing updates and upgrading the functionality of the HomePod as it is a state of the art product and a lot of technology went into it but is not being taken advantage of. I am already considering getting a second HomePod to pair them up.Less"
5.0,2 months ago,John Lewis,Simply the best speakers I’ve ever owned!,"When JL recently knocked £50 of the price of these I decided to buy a pair. My old HiFi died a while back and I’d been looking for a smart replacement. I already had a few Amazon Echos linked to my Apple Music account. They were ok, the sound quality was average and the user experience was limited, Alexa often couldn’t understand my playlists or iCloud albums. The HomePods have just blown me away. Firstly the sound quality is just awesome. Set up as a stereo pair they fill the room with exquisitely clear sound that picks out all the mid and top ranges and underpins it with deep, rich bass. I’ve tried all genres, from deep house to electronic, from jazz to classical, all sound divine. Add to this the ease with which Siri can just play whatever you ask and the fact that he can hear you even at high volume and you have a fantastic user experience. Like the AirPods on the move, I’m now listening to music far more than before, digging out old albums not listened too for ages as well as discovering tons of new stuff. It’s been a fabulous experience so far. Sure, the Pods are not as smart as Alexa (though Siri is nowhere near as bad as some people make out) and yes they don’t work with my Hive stuff. But I didn’t buy them for that, I bought them to be my primary music system and they do that with near perfection. That said I do use them for making phone calls, they are a great speakerphone, plus I also link them to my Apple TV and they sound way better than my current sound bar. This is for Apple users only and the Pods only work natively with Apple Music (you can AirPlay Spotify and other players) but if that’s you then I guarantee you’ll wonder where how you’ve managed all this time without them.Less"
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Excellent speaker!,"The quality of sound on a speaker this size never ceases to amaze me. The microphones’ ability to pick up you voice when talking to Siri with music playing full blast is just awesome too. Some people tend to point out Siri is terrible or worse than Google Assistant and/or Amazon Alexa, but Siri will never be as good as those assistants as it does not collect data like they do. Also, Apple is marketing this device as a high fidelity speaker first and voice assistant second, whereas it’s the opposite for Google and Amazon. That explains the prices differences. A couple other things to note. This speaker is geared towards Apple devices. There is no auxiliary jack or Bluetooth support, which forces the user to use Apple’s wireless streaming protocol: Apple AirPlay, which was recently updated to AirPlay 2. AirPlay 2 allows for Apple devices to stream music wirelessly to speakers or receivers that support AirPlay 2 for multi-room audio (similar to Sonos - Sonos now supports AirPlay 2), but you can use any brand speaker that supports it. AirPlay 2 uses WiFi and is much better than Bluetooth anyway, but this unfortunately does not allow non-Apple users to use the HomePod with their devices. Pros: -Excellent sound -Excellent microphones -Multi-user voice support -Ability to receive future software updates with new features Cons: -Marketed towards only Apple users -No headphone jack -No BluetoothLess"
4.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,"Good smart speaker, but not great","First I want to say that I am happy with my purchase. The HomePod is a good sounding and reasonably competent smart speaker. I purchased this on Black Friday and at that price I think this was a fair deal. The things that stop this from being a 5 star review are as follows: The reviews I read stated this as the best sounding smart speaker and this may be true, but in my opinion it is not the best sounding portable speaker. I have a Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth speaker that is of smaller form factor that I feel is a better sounding speaker. As a smart speaker, Siri is ok but I have a Google Home Mini that is more competent at internet type questions. I don’t have any smart home devices that Siri or Google can control so I can’t speak to that, but the grand kids have a lot of fun asking Google stupid internet questions that Siri doesn’t handle as well. I have asked questions that Siri did not answer that Google did. It would be nice if the HomePod supported music platforms other than Apple Music like Spotify or Pandora. Now this was not a real issue for me as I had Apple Music for free with my phone service but for other users this may be an issue. Pluses for the HomePod. I would like to mention that the HomePod can answer a phone and do so for multiple users. The Google Home Mini can place an internet call with a predetermined phone number For caller ID but it cannot answer a call to your phone (it can answer duo phone calls). The HomePod can place calls from your phone and answer phone calls to your phone. It does this for multiple users as it determines which phone to use by your voice. I wanted this feature so my wife can answer her phone while being busy in the kitchen which is where our HomePod is setup. Another plus for the HomePod is that setup is so easy. Granted you have to be an iPhone or iPad user but most of the setup is copied from your iPhone or iPad. Things such as WiFi setup and Siri recognizing your voice is all taken from your device."
1.0,5 months ago,John Lewis,Most expensive poor quality speaker and least functional home hub,"If you want just a hub to play your Apple Music then fine, you just bought yourself an expensive poor quality sound speaker. On the other hand if you want a home hub for home automation, then this is the most useless least functional hub there is currently available on the market with the least amount of compatible automation accessories. I install home automation and bought this to try it out before offering it as an option to potential customers. I will not be using or offering this hub. Here are a list of problems: - extremely poor voice recognition and translation by Siri. Both Alexa and Google are much better, more intelligent and have learning capability. - the cheapest Echo and google home have better sound quality. - Using Philips smart lighting you do not need a bridge with Alexa but you do with Apple home hub. - there are every type of smart accessories and appliances you wish to have are Alexa compatible, but you will be hard pushed to find anything that’s Apple home hub compatible. - connecting iPad or iPhone to Home hub is a manual operation and only achieved through the iPhone or iPad and not voice controlled through home hub. You are quite frankly better off with a wifi or blue tooth speaker tethered to an iPad since you will get more functionality. Echo Show plus for the same price, will give you same quality sound, a thousand times more functionality and a screen. It seems Steve Jobs was Apple and without him Apple is just a brand in decline.Less"
5.0,3 months ago,ebay.com,"Once you start using Home Pods (especially with Apple Music) , You'll be hooked and never regret the purchase.","I have always loved my music playing in background or for a more serious/critical listening sessions . And I've always pursued high quality in the process. I have several high'ish end systems throughout the house. But at time setting the equipment up and sorting thru many CDs can deter me from following up. especially if I'm not in one place. Being able to just ask Siri to to place this or that at will from anywhere is a true joy which has me reuniting with a lot of forgotten tunes as well as appreciating much new stuff. Right form the bat I enrolled in Apple Music as it make the usage of home pods so much easier and enjoyable vs interfacing a device through airplay. I have set up a few stereo home pods systems where I have better old school wired systems. But am really satisfied using the Home pods more often. However, though the sound quality of the Home pod can't compete with my higher end wired equipment, they are impressive for their size and outperform most others. NO, they can't quite* compete with upper level and higher cost speakers like say a SONOS 5. But *homepod(s) provide a more enveloping sound stage everywhere (even as just a single) vs in a sweet spot like a conventional speaker or Sonos etc . And in stereo pairs of HOme Pods, for a similar cost to one higherend single, they are quite impressive. I appreciate how Apple spent much time in developing these. And the fact they analyze their environment (to a degree) once placed and again if moved to retain good sound is pretty impressive tech. I have several ideas on how they could be made even better. I trust Apple will do such via IOS updates over time, as they have to advance them to where they are now vs what they started as.Less"
5.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Great smart speaker!,"Let me just start by saying that Apple is marketing this more as a premium speaker with high quality audio, rather than a smart speaker. Don’t expect Siri to be as smart as Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa because Siri will never be able to compete with them as long as Apple has such strict privacy policies. That being said, this speaker is for a very niche group of users. This speaker part of Apple’s smart home platform, Apple HomeKit. If you’re all in on the Apple ecosystem and love music, then this is a perfect buy for you. This speaker does not have a auxiliary line in and does not support Bluetooth. It must be used with apple’s wireless steaming protocol, AirPlay 2, which uses WiFi. It’s much better than Bluetooth as WiFi has much better range, and AirPlay 2 allows for multi-room audio, such as Sonos speakers do. Since this speaker is part of Apple HomeKit, you can use Siri for music control, smart device control and personal tasks such as calls, texts, calendars and reminders. As for the speaker side of things, it sounds really good. Very good range of lows, mids and highs. What blows me away the most though is how incredible its microphones are. You can have it at full blast and be in another room and it’ll still be able to hear you just fine without having to shout or yell like at Google’s and Amazon’s speakers. Price is steep, but if you enjoy high quality sound and the ease of use with Apple products and their ecosystem, then this speaker is worth itLess"
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great speaker but wait until they are on sale,"I bought a pair of HomePods from Best Buy right before Christmas when they were on sale for $199 apiece. At that price, the ability to play music (directly from Apple Music or via AirPlay from an iPhone or iPod) or sound from an Apple TV more than justified the price for the pair. (I have them set up to play as a stereo pair.) A good stereo would cost as much and saddle me with unsightly speaker wires. And the bass on these is just awesome, particularly when you figure the relatively small size. I liked them enough that a few days after Christmas, I decided to pick up a second pair to use in another room. However, at that point the price had gone up to $300. They are nice speakers but at $200 apiece they are pricey; at $300 apiece they are way overpriced. My advice. Wait until they go on sale for $199 either at Best Buy or at another retailer that Best Buy will price match. As for Siri functionality, I was pleasantly surprised. She can hear me even when the HomePods are playing music pretty loudly. And most of the basic commands I’ve tried work well. Voice control of HomeKit accessories seems brisker than the same command given to Alexa. However, when I ask Siri to turn on a group of lights she does fine but when I ask her to turn off the same group, she replies, “I can’t turn off a scene.” Odd. Where Siri still falls down is on knowledge-based requests. She still tends to want to send you the information as a link to a website you can view on your iPhone or other screen. Since HomePod has no screen, these requests cannot be fulfilled. The basic bottom line is these are great speakers when on sale but overpriced at full price. Smart speaker functionality is getting better all the time but still needs some work. Oh, and you still need an iOS device to set the HomePod up, so if the HomePod is your only Apple device, you’re out of luck,Less"
4.0,11 months ago,bhphotovideo.com,Compared to Sonos PLAY: 1,"I have a pair of Sonos Play:1speakers and am comparing the Apple Home Pods set up in stereo configuration to these. As others have noted, the Sonos are close--very close in audio quality to Home Pods. I set up the Pods with the Sonos speakers side by side and played different songs switching from Pod to Sonos back and forth. To my older (74) ears Sonos are just bit more tinny and bright than Apples, but not that much. Unless you are listening closely, likely you wont notice. Actually, in some songs Apple can seem a little mushy, but that may have to do with equalizer settings. IMHO, at the same price, Apple would win, but at almost twice the cost, it is a hard choice. Apple does fill the room better than Sonos. There has been some wrong information about song accessibility. For example, can you play songs that you previously downloaded to iTunes from your CDs, etc? (That is, they were NOT purchased from Apple.) YES, with both Pods and Sonos, you can play ALL your music that is listed in iTunes directly from iTunes on a MAC computer using Air Play, or from an iPhone using the Apple Music App, or by using Siri. Sonos has a great software program that also lets you play from your entire iTunes library on a MAC or an iPhone/Pad using Sonos software, which works well. Either Pods or Sonos will also play from Apple Music choices. Currently I am leaning towards keeping the Home Pods but the jury is still out. It is a personal vs financial choice and you really need to have them set up side by side to hear the subtle differences. If money is no object, I would recommend the Pods, otherwise it depends on how much a little better is worth to you. As to control, of course Apples Siri is built in and it works well. She understands you even from across a large room speaking in a normal voice. Crazy. Sonos can be controlled with an Amazon Dot or Echo. I do not know how well these devices work or what they cost, but that adds to the equation.Less"
5.0,3 months ago,walmart.com,Great Speaker,"I have owned my HomePod for over eight months now. If you have the appropriate wifi, there is no other way to connect this speaker, and use Apple devices this speaker will blow your mind. If you donâ€™t use Apple this speaker isnâ€™t for you. When I first bought the speaker siri was not great nor terrible. However, the ios13 updates have changed my HomePod. First siri is truly able to distinguish who is talking to her. She can make calls, play music, send messages and etc for 6 different family members and she will send a message to phones for authentication if itâ€™s the wrong person trying to perform the actions. With the new handoff feature the experience is even better while using HomePod! I donâ€™t have to do anything except hold my phone over the speaker and any audio automatically transfers and that also includes phone calls. I own an Apple TV and the speaker makes for a great experience as it sounds amazing. Lastly, and most importantly, the sound is incredible! The speaker is so small and everyone who hears it is blown away by the sound! The HomePod has become one of my most used devices with all of the major improvements the updates have given the speaker. I will be buying more.Less"
1.0,a month ago,Best Buy,"Siri is so bad, it’s truly an embarrassment","I bought several HomePods to replace Amazon Alexa’s in my home, due to privacy concerns. At first, I was pleasantly surprised by how little functionality I lost, with the help of some bridge apps, like Yonomi, Siri Shortcuts, and a piece of software I use called homebridge, I obtained off github. I was also surprised by how good they sound. I mean, they don’t sound anywhere near as good as a real home theater/hi-fi setup. But, for smart speakers, they’re leaps and bounds ahead of the others. Unfortunately, that’s where the love affair ends. I could absolutely care less about music. I don’t even have Apple Music installed on any of my iOS devices. I consider the Music to be malware. It takes over your device every chance it gets, often ignoring the last audio source listened to, in my case it’s mostly podcasts and audiobooks, to shove music down your throat. I DISLIKE this behavior and the HomePod is completely infected with Apple Music. If the HomePod misunderstands anything, its defaults to Apple Music and tries to play a song. Just now, I was watching a tv show and the actor said, “seriously?”, and the HomePod replied, “I don’t know who is speaking,” and then started playing music. Some random song that I didn’t care for. OMG! Then, this morning, I asked Siri, “how long will it take me to get to my next appointment?” Siri responded, “I can’t find that song,” then started playing some random music. I then asked, “how long will it take me to drive to my next appointment?” Siri responded, “traffic is light to John’s Barber shop in St Marys, so it will take about 45 minutes.” A) that is not the location of my appointment, B) I’ve never heard of or been to John’s Barber Shop and C) I don’t live in St Marys. I live in another town that is 45 minutes away. My appointment was literally 10 minutes from my house. Using the HomePod with the Apple TV is also frustrating. One of my Apple TV’s is named Theater Tv. I can say, “pause Theater tv,” and the video will pause. Then if I say, “play Theater tv,” Siri will respond, “I’m having trouble playing your music,” then about 30 seconds later, a random song will start playing. Another problem is when saying, “unpause Theater tv,” Siri will respond, “playing on multiple sources,” and will turn on and start playing music on multiple TVs throughout my home. OMG this is so annoying! Then I tried to set up some Siri Shortcuts. I’ve got a Logitech Harmony remote and I used Yonomi to bridge Siri and the Harmony with Siri Shortcuts. I created a shortcut to turn on my projector, another to trigger the 3D Movie scene, one to control the AC unit, and another to turn on the theater room. So, when I asked Siri to, “turn 3D movie on, “ or, “ turn AC on,” or, “turn Tv room” I either got told that Siri didn’t have the capability or that there was no such room. I had to chance the names of the Siri Shortcuts to just random words and phrases to get them to work. 3D Movie became Bigtime, Tv room became just the word Maple, and AC’s became Turn Cool Breeze On. Then, there are connectivity issues. Just about every morning, one of my HomePods, when given a command, will respond, “Something went wrong, please try again later.” Often, rebooting the HomePod, from the Home App, fixes the issue. But every few days, one of my HomePods will have to be deleted from the Home app and re-paired to get it working again. Moreover, I get, “device not responding,” responses when trying to operate one of my HomeKit devices, by Siri on my phone can communicate with the device without issue. How is it that Siri on the HomePod is so much more incompetent than Siri on the iPhone. They should be the same, right? But, they are not. I called Apple to see if I could get some help and the senior tech was snarky to me and basically told me I was doing it wrong (kind reminded me of Steve Jobs telling everyone that they were holding the iPhone 4 wrong) and that I had to learn a whole new vocabulary to use Siri and that I was going to continue to have to name things random words, and remember them all, because that’s just how Siri works. He also flat out refused to troubleshoot Siri Shortcuts....Wow, just wow. If you’re buying HomePods just for music, I guess they’re fine. But if you’re buying them for smart home control, be prepared to be severely disappointed. This is the most un-Apple like experience/product I’ve ever had. They’re literally like disappointment and frustration generating machines. There is no delight to be found here. Siri is unbelievably stupid and incompetent at home control. Since home control is my primary concern, my only concern, I can’t give the product more than one star."
5.0,11 months ago,bhphotovideo.com,Very pleased,"I did a fair amount of research before I purchased Apple Homepods (2) for our recently remodeled kitchen. By far my primary (if not only) interest was the quality of the sound, rather than the number of features that the various smart speakers offer. The HomePods work great and Im very pleased with them. They were very easy to install and to pair for stereo sound. The sound is very crisp and clean, with a terrific soundstage. Compared to very high quality stereo systems and/or surround sound systems with subwoofers, I would say that the bass on the HomePods is a little on the light side, but thats to surprising to me and it seems like a reasonable exchange the relative smallness of the HomePods and their ease of installation. I very much like that they optimize their sound to the specific space they are in. They are very easy to use, both directly (directing Siri to play from Apple Music) and through streaming services such as Spotify, which I use from my phone or laptop and stream through the HomePods using Airplay. There is no problem with this whatsoever. It is equally easy to stream the audio from my computers (including from the video streaming services), though thats an infrequent application for me.

I am very pleased with them.Less"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Sounds Great and Does so Much More,"I got this speaker to compliment my Apple TV 4K for traveling. I did not have much interest in it at the $300 price tag. However, I was able to get it open box at lower than the $200 sale price tag. I am glad I got it. Pros: sound is very good for the size, easy interaction with other Apple products, it can be used to make and answer phone calls, can be paired with a second HomePod and linked for better sound or multiple room configuration with Airplay 2 and Sonos products. You can have Siri read or send texts and multiple user voice recognition, plug and play. In addition you can use the HomePod to control smart home devices, Cons: its a heavy speaker for the size, no external jacks available, power cord is permanently attached. It works with only Apple Music. It has NO BLUETOOTH you need an iPhone or IPad to connect to it. If you are an android user I don’t recommend it but if you love Apple products like I do it’s a great addition to your Apple family. All in all it works great as a speaker with excellent sound quality sound and interacts great with other Apple products.Less"
4.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Pretty quick to get used to,"My family is pretty deep in the apple ecosystem. I held off on HomePod because of the price and we have the first gen Sonos. I bought this on sale at see how it could make things easier. Pro’s: Great for music on iTunes (most time). My family picked this up rather quickly. Good quality speakers and fills a room nicely Great if you use HomeKit. Also good for looking up info such as weather, movies, store info. Timers, I do a lot of cooking and the ability to have multiple timers going is nice. Cons: The voice recognition for music goes wonky for bit and I can’t figure out why i will say Siri play the classical station on Monday it will play the right station. Then on Tuesday I will say the same thing and something complexity different comes up. It does this for a few days then it will go back to normal. Whenever you say hey Siri every Apple device answers and it is random to which will answer your request. On the lighter side if you have some names is even remotely closed to Siri, Siri will answer. My daughters name sound simplified to Siri, and Siri will answer when I call her. Overall it is a bit iPhone which has great sound. It is a nice to have and the family picked up on its use right away but some glitches that pop up now and then stop it from a perfect score.Less"
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,I like it for my music,"Christmas present to myself. I mostly wanted it for music, possibly more Home kit stuff in the future. works well for me. I use lots of Apple products and services so I find it easy to use and convenient. I got my first one from BB for $200 - new on sale. (Probably would not have paid the regular price of $299.) I liked it so much I went back and bought a second one to setup a stereo pair in my living room. Sounds very nice for that listening space. A good wifi internet connection in the room where you place it is needed otherwise you are unlikely to find it useful. Mine occasionally looses the internet and needs to be reset (I unplug the unit wait a few seconds and plug it back in. Open the Home app on my iPhone and check settings. Sometimes it is checking for/waiting for an update). I use iTunes Match and can ask Siri to play any of my hundreds of albums or any of the thousand of individual songs I have uploaded to my iTunes Match account and the HomePod plays them. I love the instant voice activated access to all of my music. Also works with my Apple TV if I want to use the HomePods for my TV sound output. Good product if you know what you are buying and what the current and future uses are/will be with new Home kit functionality and new compatible devices becoming available.Less"
5.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Better than I thought,"I wanted an assistant that could integrate with the smart lightning/devices around the house. But, I also wanted the assistant to not keep my audio in the cloud somewhere where the company/third party contractors/etc could listen to it also. The only choice for such an assistant so far is the HomePod, since as long as you opt out, Apple will not keep your audio in the cloud. I wasn't expecting much, since I've had Alexa's and Google Home around the house before and they both didn't work terribly great. However, the HomePod is remarkably better at listening to the ""Hey Siri"" command from everyone (from adults to children) in my household. This is even when the HomePod is playing music. I used to have multiple Google Homes dispersed throughout the house because Google just couldn't hear the ""Hey Google"" command very well. But now I just have one HomePod in the center of the house that can be used from nearly anywhere in the house. I don't enjoy the price as much and hope that come out with cheaper version of Siri speakers.Less"
4.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,"Good sound, compact size","To get this out of the way upfront, I am in the Apple ecosystem. I have iPads, iPhones, and MacBook Pros and like the way they work together. In its current form, this is not a product for everyone. I would think it would be practically unusable if you weren’t at least partially in Apple’s ecosystem. If you want the device to stream music from an internet source, you need to have an Apple Music subscription. I don’t, but I have iTunes Match so this device can stream my music from the cloud. Unlike other devices, like my Echo, it doesn’t support Pandora, Spotify, etc at this time. You can use AirPlay and send these sources to your HomePod from your phone, iPad, MacBook, but not without. The sound quality is very good for its size. It is able to fill the room, sounds clear and crisp, with a good overall sound. Some reviews complain about too much bass. I can see this being true, as it does seem to emphasize bass a little bit. I haven’t noticed it to be a problem in the genres I listen to (Country and Classic Rock primarily). As far as a smart speaker, it does a great job of hearing your spoken commands. I think it exceeds the competition here. Siri almost never miss hears me or ignores me. I can’t say the same for Alexa. Siri has gotten a lot better since this was released. There are still some things she ‘can’t do on this HomePod’ but overall is pretty good. I have to take away one star because of one problem. Being in the Apple ecosystem, I wanted to have Siri add things to my grocery list, reminders, send texts, etc, and I get told the iPhone that was used to setup HomePod must be on the same Wi-Fi network much too often when it is sitting right next to me. I do think it is a 4 star product with the other limitations mentioned above because it generally does everything it promises to do very well. If you are unaware of the limitations, you may be disappointed. Another thing to consider is the color. I went with the black because the white was dirty immediately after being taken out of the box."
3.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,"Decent smart speaker, sub-par smart home device.","This thing is basically a glorified smart speaker with decent sound quality. If you want to control smart home devices throughout your home using and control home automation using voice command, this is not the device for you. Both Google Home and Alexa have multiple speakers and hubs to choose from and allow you the ability to link them throughout your home. This is great for creating a whole home surround sound systems and speaker groups, or even an intercom to communicate to family members in other areas of your home. Alexa and Google Home also offer devices such as the Google Hub, the Echo Show, and the Echo Spot which also allow you to view your security cameras, baby monitors, and make video calls hands free. Alexa can even make your car or regular speakers a smart speaker with Echo Input and Echo Car. If I had to choose between my Homepod, Alexa, or Google Home, I would have to say Alexa is my favorite and at half the price of the HomePod. If sound quality is important, simply buy an Echo Plus and the subwoofer attachment. Google Home has the Max.Less"
4.0,5 months ago,bhphotovideo.com,Superb Sound,"We replaced multiple bluetooth speakers with a pair of HomePods. They were incredibly easy to set up and synch with our network. They are on both sides of an open-concept living space, so one can be used in the kitchen area and another in the living room. However, they can also work as a pair for the entire space. The two speakers synch immediately to form a stereo pair with no perceivable delay. It's amazing and one of those things by Apple that just works. Siri also works fairly well, but one has to know some of the quirks. For example, it doesn't go to the next episode of a podcast very well, or even play the proper one on request. Reportedly this will get better with the upcoming update later this year. My only reason for not giving it five stars is the lack of native support for Spotify. Not everyone subscribes to Apple Music. While streaming is available through AirPlay, I wish it were more simple and responsive to Siri. Otherwise, this is a fabulous audio addition to our home. The bass and treble are perfect while synchronous use is like magic.Less"
4.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Great speaker,The HomePod is something really special that will expand its options as updates come available over time. The sound on this impeccable piece of engineering is absolutely INCREDIBLE. I’m a audiophile at heart. I have to have the best of the best when it comes to sound. This has 7-speakers that offer crisp and clear keynotes that can make you hear things that you normally couldn’t in the smart speaker world. I also have a Sonos and believe me when I say this that the sound comparison between the Apple’s HomePod and the Sony’s Sonos has a marginal gap. I was blown away by how impressive the HomePod sounds. The microphone also has pretty good range. I was 3 rooms away and Siri picked up what I said (with kids running in the background) and played 80s Rock. That was impressive for a small but heavy speaker. Speaking of heavy. That is due to the magnet that is in this speaker. The bass that comes from this thing is MIGHTY impressive. I’ve had friends come over during the weekend and they never guessed it was coming from the HomePod. They thought it was my Bose Home Theatre system that I usually have on. Needless to say they were blown away as it knows where it’s sitting by using sound waves reporting back to the device so that’ll it’ll adjust to any room setting.Less
5.0,5 months ago,very.co.uk,Fantastic Sound,"I’ve only had it a week but I love this little speaker. I use it mostly for audio from my TV (connected via Apple TV - connects through Bluetooth so should be possible through other Bluetooth-enabled TVs). It has brilliant sound, especially for films. The bass on it is the most noticeable difference compared to my TVs speakers. It is also so simple and fast to connect to any iOS device, so if you just get home you can easily connect to the HomePod and continue listening to your music or podcast. Apple are also advertising some nice new features to expect in November (through an OS update) which I’m quite excited for. Siri works well, it seems a lot better at picking up my voice than my phone and it can hear you even over its own audio. I would usually say “hey Siri” then wait for the beep to know it was listening, but actually if you just ask it a question immediately, with no pause, it picks it up no problem. It also supports multi-speaker over AirPlay, so I can play music from my laptop but have the audio come out both my laptop and the HomePod.Less"

The sound is phenomenal, the functionality is phenomenal...however....the first month I had this device, I was plagued with constant issues keeping my devices connected to the speaker. I use this device 99% of the time with airplay from my iPhone X. During this month, I could not play music for more than about 30-45 minutes before I would lose connection to it. The HomePod would not drop off if my network, it was almost like it would start rejecting traffic from my iPhone. I tested this on an iPhone X, iPhone 6s, iPad Pro, and from iTunes on a windows based computer. I set the HomePod up on its own wireless network (different access point than my main) that was very close to it to verify the signal was strong, but the issue still occurred. After a couple factory resets and making some changes to my home hub settings, this issue *seems* to have disappeared. I have also revamped my home network to a Ubiquiti one, so that might also be a factor. Either way, the speaker still sound absolutely stunning. Especially the bass that this little can is able to create.Less"

While we have home automation with Alexa and Google. Both me and my best friend also have mostly Apple devices. We stopped in our local BestBuy and we saw the HomePod on display. We tested it out and we were hooked line and sinker. However, once we got it setup 10 minutes and realized how freaking easy it was to setup we tested it in the home. The sensors in the device adjusts to the acoustic of the area it is placed in. We were in awe at how this device performed. My best friend had set tumbler down with a cold drink on the same table as the HomePod and as soon as he released the tumbler the HomePod made an adjustment to the quality of sound. He picked the tumbler out of disbelief thinking it was just my imagination. And the HomePod readjust itself again and then he put it back down and the HomePod again readjust the sound. Nevertheless the HomePod not only connected to our WiFi and Apple Music account all within the 10 minutes. I am very surprised Apple isn’t selling these at a record pace.Less"
3.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Amazing sound; wifi lag and Airplay - eh,"I bought two, for a stereo set, when on sale. Figured they'd work well with my Apple devices. The wonderful: music is beautiful, TV and films are generally fantastic. I use it primarily with my iPad Pro 12"", iPhone 6s Plus both on iOS 13. Occasionally on my Mac, in the Music app. I believe the latest iOS update improved the speakers' reliability. Classical, rock, folk, jazz - all excellent. With the improved reliability lately, I won't return them. I was otherwise considering it, The eh: one speaker often picks up sound before the other. The lag isn't huge, just annoying. Occasionally the connection doesn't happen. I have to try a few times, both in Apple Music and using Airplay. The speakers cut out on occassion, then resume sound. Depending on the app, Airplay can be a nightmare. In Music, Prime Video, Netflix - rarely problems. Airplay in the Criterion Channel app sometimes works, sometimes becomes a nightmare and unuseable. MacOS: like everyone else....why limited to iTunes? When my older MacBook eventually fails, hopefully not for a while, and if I can purchase the 16"", I'd like to watch films on the newer, larger screen and use the Homepods. Siri: gets confused. The speakers are in my bedroom. I did not purchase them for Siri but for their music quality. When my iPhone, iPad, and HomePod are in the room together, I can say, ""Siri, turn off the lights,"" and at least two-three devices respond.

After trying the DIY fixes posted online we called Apple Support. We do not have Apple Care or a close Apple Store, but since our speaker is still inside it’s one year warranty customer service offered to send a box for us to send the speaker in for repair. At this we were fine with that resolution. Unfortunately after waiting 2 weeks, the box never arrived and I had to contact customer service again. Since the delay was due to lack of follow up on Apples side, I asked them to upgrade my service level for this incident to Apple Care and send a replacement and I would immediately return the faulty Home Pod. I was VERY frustrated when not only was I refused the upgraded service to cover Apples Oversight - but the Customer Service rep refused to escalate to someone who had authority to create a better resolution due to their original service oversight. We have made enormous investments in Apple products and have appreciated their focus on user experience - but this experience will have us evaluating their competitors before making future purchases.Less"
4.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Sounds is great. A few caveats.,"I think it sounds great, my issues with the HomePod are: 1.) It has Bluetooth built in but no way to directly connect a device outside of airplay. 2.) If there are multiple users switching isn’t always seamless, at times it wouldn’t even show up as a device to stream to. 3.) It’s authorized under the person who sets up MyHome. I bought this for my girlfriend mostly but because I am the one who set up the HomeKit appliances (Lights, thermostat etc) it has to go under my home account or I’d have to reset everything under a new home account. Even though both users are set as administrators, it’s my phones messages who Siri will read. 4.) Siri still needs more features, she’s decent at what she can do but I’ve seen better utility with Alexa, and this is coming from an avid Apple user. Outside of those issues. The sound is great and having a voice assistant to set timers and dim the lights is nice. If you have the money it’s a o-k purchase, if you’re just wanting a wireless speaker that can use Siri, well, Siri is still on your phone and there are other very nice Bluetooth speakers out there.Less"
5.0,2 weeks ago,walmart.com,A must for iPhone owners,"Really handsome, stylish speaker. I like the all-black model which blends in well near my TV and entertainment center, where all the gadgets are black.

Such rich, unbelievable sound. It has some other â€œsuper powersâ€ that have made it a home run with the whole family. For anyone in the household that has an iPhone, Siri on HomePod can check your calendar, create reminders, read and send messages, make calls, create notes, etc. It does it by somehow recognizing whoâ€™s talking and then effortlessly connecting to their own iPhone. If you have an iPhone, thisâ€™ll take things to the next level."

As someone who at one time had a Google home, Echo and HomePod in each room of my home (...I have a problem) I can confidently say that the HomePod is the best at controlling my home. Whether it's the lights, the doors, the appliances, my nanoleaf stuff or whatever because of HomeKit...it works. My Google/Amazon speakers couldn't control all of my Philips Hue lights because there were too many and they can only connect to one Hue Bridge. HomeKit/HomePod can connect to multiple. I also think this one has the best microphones, by far. Even when music is playing, I don't have to speak more than at a conversational level to get Siri's attention. Also, I'm really impressed with Siri's ability to process complex commands - ""Turn off all of the lights upstairs except for the ones in the guest bathroom"", pretty cool. Also, I like the sound but I'm not blown away by it (-1 star). I don't think that it's THAT big of a difference from the Plus or Max though. HomeKit is the selling point for me. *I'm fully integrated into Apple's ecosystem. Services, hardware, clouds, etc. So I'm probably the exact right audience for this.*Less"
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Great Speaker, lousy smart assistant.","Full disclosure I bought this knowing it was limited in it's capabilities, I am just writing this as an overall review of the speaker. The sound quality is by far greater than what you are going to get out of Alexa and Google home, however, if you are buying this as a smart assistant or a smart home controller, you may want to hold off. The home pod is only compatible with devices that are home kit enabled, which is a small collection and tends to be premium and pricey options. Surprisingly, the HomePod does not control the apple tv, so if voice control for television is something you want it will be best to look at Alexa with fire tv or Google and ChromeCast. Lack of support for popular streaming apps is a turn off as well. You can very easily stream music from your iphone to the speaker, but it is an extra step that ignores the basic premise of the speaker being an easy to use one stop for entertainment. If the sound quality from the Google or Amazon offerings is a big turn off, I recommend looking at a Sonos Speaker, unless you absolutely have to have the Apple brand or Apple Music is your sole provider or musical content. However, the speaker is not good at finding a song for you. Both Alexa and Google are much better at identifying lyrics and getting you the song. Home Pod and Siri can only do this if the title of the song is in the lyric you give it. Now where this speaker shines is its sound quality. Bass is nice and deep, and one home pod is capable of filling a 2200 sqft house with sound. Additionally, the latest updates have allowed for you to place a second home pod or compatible speaker in the same area to provide with stereoscopic surround sound. Set up for this is also automatic and very easy to configure. If you are only concerned with overall sound quality while maintaining a device that seamlessly integrates into the Apple environment, then this speaker is for you. If you are OK with a premium price tag, and waiting for possible updates that are promised to add features, this is for you. However, if you want a smart assistant that can control features in your house, I have to say go for one of the others available."
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Phenomenal!...With a catch,"I'm a long time Amazon Echo user. I love my Echo. It connect with a ridiculous number of services, and is a respectable bluetooth speaker. I haven't had a reason to switch to anything else. Then I heard the Apple HomePod. I'm a nerd who love tinkering so on a certain level I love the flexibility of the Echo. On a more realistic level I just never use that flexibility. I listen to music and ask silly questions to get the thing to give silly responses. I already use Apple Music and let me tell you, the Echo isn't even in the same class as the Echo speaker-wise. This. Thing. Sounds. Phenomenal. One speaker easily fills a large room with incredibly well-balanced music. As for Siri, I honestly have struggled adopting it due to poor detection or just clumsy responses. The Siri that comes with the HomePod is ridiculously fast, and actually feels more conversational. Now the ""catch"". It simply doesn't compare to other devices when it comes to integrating with other home automation devices. Compatibility is limited to HomeKit approved devices which while expanding, isn't terribly robust yet. I'm confident that this will improve (assuming Apple remains committed to this market) but I would definitely do your research to make sure your devices are compatible before buying if that's important to you. In short, if you're in the Apple eco-system (Apple Music, Apple News, Reminders, etc.) then you can't go wrong. If you're a home automation nerd, do your research and prepare to either be disappointed or make some sacrifices. And if you just love music, just give this thing a listen. You won't regret it.Less"
4.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Very good speaker.,"This is my second homepod, which I have paired to the first for stereo sound. I love the convenience of voice-controlling stuff like volume up and down, skipping songs, setting up timers. For the most part, Siri picks up from whenever I am and understands and executes. What I don't like is that, I typically play music from an iMac. It used to be Spotify via Airfoil. Turns out Airfoil can't handle two HomePods that have been paired up, and so, I now have moved away from Spotify and am using iTunes and radio stations (not Apple Music). I'm hoping that Airfoil will sort this out soon. Also, the two HomePods are next to a Sony soundbar/subwoofer which, to be honest, I've never thought to have extraordinarily powerful sound. For Apple TV, I believe the two HomePods simply are no match for the soundbar. The soundbar volume is much higher and, probably more important, seems to have a better connection to the Apple TV (via HDMI, of course) and the sound is always consistent, no lag, no frustrating pauses or disconnects that the HomePods seem to experience.Less"
2.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Apple really missed the mark on this one.,"Trying to use one of these in a business environment was such a process. In most business/enterprise/education environments you have to enroll devices -- this is a network security feature that only allows registered devices access to the network. Devices are usually identified by their MAC address (no relation to Apple). It could be super easy to just print this on the box or on the product where the serial number is (btw who's idea was it to print all the text in the same color as the base of the HomePod? -- it's literally like those undercover police cars that say ""Police"" in a way to where you can barely see it from the right angle). So began the tedious task of trying to hunt down the MAC address. Before I could even begin the setup failed because it wanted me to enable two-factor authentication and sign into my iCloud. There should be a way to choose a mode -- consumer or commercial (enterprise/education) that bypasses these two requirements. Because i setup my Apple ID a long time ago, I had to go thru and reset my security questions and then answer them to proceed. Then I had to turn on my iPhone's hotspot and source a second iPhone to use to actually set up the HomePod. After that process was completed, I had to use a Mac (computer) and connect the Mac to my iPhone's hotspot which after downloading an app called Network Scanner (by Trend Micro) finally revealed the Mac address for the HomePod. This whole last step with the Mac could've been eliminated if Apple would provide a way to see devices connected to the personal hotspot on iPhone, like Android phones do. Nonetheless, after getting the MAC address and registering it with the network, I had to restore the HomePod and go thru the setup process again to actually get it on the WiFi now. The average person isn't that committed or technical to spend an hour trying to do all the things you need to do to get a HomePod working in a secure networking environment and nowadays with a lot of business technologies slowly making their way into home network devices (i.e. mesh networks, cloud networking) it's becoming more of a reality that this (MAC address filtering) is something you may run into. While I understand these extra protocols if you're going to be using your HomePod with home automation devices, it seems like a lot of extra, extra for someone just wanting to stream music from iPhone/iPad/Mac to a speaker wirelessly. And at a steep premium even so. After setting it up, the audio was impressive, immersive and had just the right amount of punch for bass. At times though, it seemed like the audio was really coming out at about a 45 degree angle versus a 180 or 360 that's advertised."

2.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Disappointing sound quality,"I bought a pair of HomePods with the hope of simplifying the sound system in my home office. I was disappointed for a number of reasons. I returned them to the store. 1. Setup was a bit frustrating. I was playing music from a desktop Mac, but the speakers played random selections of their own at top volume. Once I got them silenced, the update process took a very long time before I could gain full control over them. 2. Stereo paring: When I set them up as a “stereo pair” they immediately began playing separate tracks from my library at different volume levels. Quitting the Music app was the only way to resolve this. a. The paired speakers are accessible from the Music app by not the System Preferences panel. There they appear as separate devices. 3. Sound quality was the greatest disappointment. Voices in choral works sounded like they were coming out of a cardboard box and they lacked warmth. Orchestral works lacked richness and complexity. Overall the sound was much inferior to the surround sound system and patchwork of speakers I’ve been using for the past several years.Less"

The Hey Siri detection is second to absolutely nothing thanks to those much-vaunted ""beamforming"" microphones, which also make phone calls nice and clear even if you're 30 feet away speaking at a normal volume. But most importantly, the sound is wonderful for its size and great for really anything. It's a punchy little speaker with outsize bass that handles anything you can throw at it. Like other reviewers have said, Apple did a great job of tuning this speaker to communicate the intent of anything it plays, so aggressive music will make you angry and calm, beautiful music will bring a tear to your eye. It goes extremely loud with no distortion and the ""tunes itself to your surroundings"" part of the sound is really everything it says it is. It sounds huge and fills up rooms if placed correctly and you'll really never get any ""meh"" sound out of it. However, you are essentially required to have Apple Music to get the most out of it, and not owning an iPhone will mean that you just bought a very nice piece of useless decor, as you won't even be able to set it up without an iOS device (sorry, Mac owners, you can only play to the speaker and control the queue once you've initialized it with an iOS device.) You can airplay to it using your phone if you're a Spotify kind of person, but it's a little lamer as you can't ask Siri to play music from Spotify or any other service. One last thing: I have had some glitches with it where it won't play music from the HomePod, it will only allow you to airplay and everything else acts like it's playing but immediately shut off. I contacted Apple and was immediately escalated past senior support up to what was basically the HomePod team, and my advisor told me that it was a known issue and it was being worked on, with a fix anticipated in the next update. Given that the next update is hotly anticipated (as it's going to include AirPlay 2 and multi-room sound as well as HomePod pairing), I can't wait. Other than that, not a bad word to say about this thing. I adore it in Space Grey, and smudge it in White. I've definitely gotten my money's worth!Less"
3.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Best sound. But not a great smart speaker.,"The HomePod was my first smart speaker (I’ve owned it for a year now). I waited because the Apple hype convinced me to wait, then pay $350. I have the full Apple ecosystem, so I looked forward to a fully integrated experience. The pros are that it has the best sound of any smart speaker (I’ve since bought at least half a dozen others), and it plays great with Apple hardware, as expected. The bad news is, you cannot use it with the apps most people want, especially Spotify. Only Apple Music is “native” to the HomePod. It’s true that you can make your devices play to the HomePod - I can tell my iMac Pro to use the HomePod as it’s speaker, then play Spotify on a web browser to HomePod. Problem solved? Meh. You can’t talk to it. You can’t say, “Siri, play Eric Clapton on Spotify” and have it do that task. I now own three Harmon Kardon Invoke speakers with Cortana, and find them to be fabulous, and I bought all three for not much more than a single HomePod. HomePod is a throwback to the 2001 Apple business model of things that work only with Apple products even though that’s not what customer want.Less"
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Great for playing music and smart homes,"Believe the hype! This is a great product. Well-designed and high quality. Sound quality is great. I'm not an audiophile, but I will say that the sound coming the speaker is better than my little Bose (not a fair comparison since that one is portable, and the HomePod is not). I've also tested it out using Airplay from my Apple TV and this will provide a slightly deeper and more immersive sound if you place it next to, or behind, the listeners. I'm planning on getting another one eventually to even out the sound on the other side. Siri commands are picked up really well. And now with the last update (13.2.x) it can recognize your voice so that each member of your home can have personalized responses. My wife didn't think we needed one, but now she's hooked and uses it even more than me! So glad I took advantage of the black Friday deal. Looking forward to the next one.Less"
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,I love my HomePod!,"I know the price of this product doomed it to irrelevance in the smart speaker market but no matter what Apple decides to do with the HomePod I’ll always love it. It’s super easy to setup, it calibrates itself to sound great no matter where you put it. Siri sounds great, makes Alexa sound like a robot. It sounds amazing. The highs are great, the mid range (vocals) are awesome, the bass is so deep and very satisfying. On top of all that, it’s beautiful in white or black. I have three of them and if I knew that Apple was devoted to the product I would buy many more. A HomePod mini is needed badly and an investment in HomeKit would be helpful too. The HomePod should have been released for 199.00 and even then that would have been asking a lot. 349.99 was an absolutely non starter for 90% of buyers, leaving only Apple fans like me, and even I never paid full price for it. I only bought three when they were on sale for 249.00.Less"
3.0,5 months ago,bhphotovideo.com,Good build quality....,"The HomePod is my first modern home automation device. Since I have nothing else to compare with in terms of speakers; I was impressed. So much so, that I ended up purchasing four and gave one to my fiancé. The sound quality is good, but the internal microphones are outstanding. They can make out your voice much more accurately than the iPhone or AirPods. The weakest part of this device is not the whole pot itself, but apples lazy foot-dragging efforts would Siri. For the life of me, I can't understand why Apple continues to embarrass itself with something that they pioneered and then allowed others to outdo them. The speakers from Amazon and Google are much more accurate and detailed as to what they can do. If I didn't already have other iOS devices, I would have gone with one of the others'. The only reason I gave it three stars was because of the dumb-dumb Siri.Less"
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Awesome sound! Definitely consider.,"I would definitely recommend a HomePod to anyone looking to improve their home music listening experience. I just bought my second one and they’re exactly one year apart. One fills the room but two working together, is another experience entirely. When Apple says that two will work in perfect unison, they’re serious. Both HomePods detect each other and work to give equal sound in every direction possible and it doesn’t sound weak or distorted. The sound is evenly balanced and because it senses barriers and walls, it never sounds like its just”blasting” music. The pairing to one another is simple or from another Apple device is also simple. With the HomePod, I’m reminded of Steve’s old line “it just works”, and this really does."
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,The audio quality is pretty good,"This as a speaker is good, but if you don’t use Siri often, it’s no better than buying a dedicated speaker. I have a Bose S1 Pro speaker that is louder, but that one is more expensive. Also, I think the Google Home speakers are louder. If you do use Siri, this is great. It can hear you even if you speak at normal volumes at a distance. It works especially well if you have Apple Music, as you can ask Siri to play whatever song you want. If you haven’t invested heavily in other Apple products, then there isn’t much appeal here. On the other hand, if you do have iPhones, iPads, Apple TV’s, and Macs in your house, you will enjoy adding this product to the lineup. It also holds up well over time, given that the hardware in this product is from the time of the iPhone 6 or 6s. It still sounds good and there isn’t any lag that I’ve noticed.Less"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Smart Speaker for the Apple Environment,"With the Apple HomePod connected, amplified audio is a snap. No amplifier, nor endless wires, and great bass/ treble plus Dolby Atmos with Airplay 2 is supported for audiophiles. Siri is omnipresent when within speaking range for voice commands, and home automation is built in to each Apple HomePod if you want to explore the Apple HomeKit. One HomePod sounds great with its booming subwoofer. Connect a 2nd one and the Apple system detects and connects both for well balanced stereo output. Or put one in multiple rooms for whole home audio immersion! Viewing video content (especially with an Apple TV) or simply streaming audio from an iPhone, iPad, or MacBook is a snap! The HomePod can also serve to be a hub for a Smarthome system. This is a super simple solution for a home audio system, or for those who want to get a foot in the door for Smarthome automation. Explore the Home app on your Apple Devices and get started with home automation and add more functionality with the Apple HomeKit. As Apple continues to refine their operating systems for all their devices, this audio solution/home automation system continues to improve with each new release. The future looks bright for the those hoping to expand their Apple-Verse to include more functionality. Do yourself a favor and get rid of those unsightly speaker and power cables and give the HomePod a try, you'll be glad you did.Less"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great Speaker!,The HomePod is an excellent small speaker. It’s not the best smart speaker but the sound quality is thoroughly enjoyable. I have slowly been replacing many of my Echos with HomePods as the budget and special pricing opportunities allow. I still maintain a few echos for the additional capabilities available with Alexa. One should always be cautious of first generation Apple products. The first Watch and iPad were both underpowered. The first iPhone was missing important features such as GPS and 3G connectivity. The HomePod’s first gen fault is being over-engineered. It’s remarkably advanced hardware that overshot the demands of the main market for smart speakers. This makes the HomePod an exceptional buy when on sale.
2.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Not even worth the huge discount I got on it,"Overall completely blown away with all the issues this thing has!! Don’t get me wrong the sound is impressive but that it. Siri is useless which I knew that going into it however when you buy apple products you expect the seamless connectivity and ease of use! That’s why I have many many apple products. However this doesn’t even seem like an apple product... it actually makes trying to listen to music a total hassle. And I have new iPhone 11 with Apple Music! Long story short airplay can’t even get through one or two song without stopping. Half the time it can’t even connect if I skip the song it just sits there thinking, and if I use Siri to play my music and does the same thing.... NOTHING!!! Some of the forums ive read said you need a good Wifi setup. Well rest assured I have the best possible WiFi! 1000mbps downloads!! So that is clearly not the case. Trust me I love apple products. I have almost every single one but this is complete trash. Totally useless piece of tech. And I’m saying all this when I bought it 9on sale for $199!! NOT WORTH THE HEADACHE!Less"
5.0,a year ago,Micro Center,Best home speaker if you already own Apple devices,"I heard and read online that the Apple Homepod sounded amazing, but it was unbelievable hearing it upon first listen in my own home. Much of my skepticism came from listening to it in the store because it was difficult to tell how much volume it had since it was in such a large, crowded space. I'm so glad my skepticism was unwarranted. Apple truly did a spectacular job engineering this speaker to sound amazing in the typical household. For the size speaker, this thing can pump volume like no other. Mid-range is clear and the low-end is tight and controlled unlike a lot of home speakers that just vomit low-end at no fidelity. The setup was elegant and simple, as with setting up most Apple products. It also works really well with all of my smart home devices (Phillips Hue, Wemo, etc.). My main use case was using it with my Apple TV 4K. It works EXTREMELY well with Apple TV 4K if you need to either boost sound from your TV or if you simply want to play the audio through the Homepod exclusively. Just select it in the control center on your iOS device and you're good to Airplay the sound with no delay. The only thing I warn is that if you're not at least somewhat in the Apple ecosystem, it's probably not worth the price tag. You can only Airplay from another device since, to my knowledge, you cannot stream audio over Bluetooth. This is honestly fine with me because the Airplay protocol has been a million times more reliable than Bluetooth has with respect to speakers (just in my experience, I've only used Bose before). In short, you'll definitely want at least one iOS device to easily control the Homepod (iPad or iPhone).Less"
4.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,"Great sound. Works well with iPad, Siri not so muc","I just received my HomePod a few days ago so I’m still trying to optimize functionality. First of all, it sounds great! Easy to use AirPlay to listen to my music and Tune In app. Bought iTunes Match with the expectation that I could use Siri to play my iTunes library, but so far that hasn’t been great. Seems more a problem of Siri not recognizing my requests (I say “play Beatles songs” and Siri says I don’t have any Beatles songs. I ask it multiple times in a row and get the same answer and then try again later and it starts to play Beatles songs from my Library.) I think that using “shortcuts” will probably help, but that is a work in progress for me. Even with these issues, I still recommend the HomePod for those who use Apple products. Also, at the moment it’s on sale for $199.Less"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Sound with Siri Improvements,"I've owned other smart speakers/assistants and while there are some advantages, the sound quality of the HomePod is hands down the best available. As I have homes in Berlin and NY, I own a handful and do notice a slight difference in the equalizer in iOS 11 vs 12. Most won't notice but if you prefer more base, don't update the firmware if the model you buy still has iOS 11. Otherwise, iOS 12 has a plethora of Siri and iCloud features such as handsfree callings, reminders, appointments/scheduling, etc along with Siri Shortcuts that make the update paramount. I've updated most of mine with the exception of two in my master bedroom and know Apple is releasing a new update that will allow users to customize the equalizer. Beyond that, Apple's improvements in Siri have finally pushed the virtual assistant to the quality level it has sorely needed for years. While I understand Apple places security/privacy above all else which has hindered Siri's ability to evolve, the last year of improvements launched with iOS 12 along with Siri Shortcuts, a clever way to create the equivalent of Alexa Skills without foregoing user privacy, and with more to come, I highly recommend the investment in a HomePod over others. If you have an Apple TV, AVR, Mac, etc with AirPlay 2, the ability to fill a room with space conscious auto-tuning is far and above what's on the market.Less"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Upgrade from Google Home and better than expected,"I was honestly skeptical about liking the HomePod, since I don't find Siri on my phone to be very reliable in recognizing her keyword or in giving me the response I want. I have to say though that I'm really impressed with the HomePod. I had been using a Google Home for about a year, and finally got to the point where I was sick and tired of having to yell ""HEY, GOOGLE!"" numerous times to get it to hear me. If the Google Home was playing music at any volume other than soft background music, then it usually wouldn't respond at all. It got super frustrating, and I think my neighbors thoughts I had anger issues. Anyway, I decided I wanted to choose a smart speaker that (1) Didn't want to throw out the window because it couldn't hear me (2) Had better audio quality than the Google Home, since I mostly use it for music and listening to podcasts. I figured I'd give the HomePod a shot. On the audio quality side, it's night and day. HomePod has excellent audio and can fill my grand room with audio in a way that Google Home couldn't. I can hear parts of tracks which were muffled or inaudible on the Google Home. As for the ability to hear the wake word, I'm impressed with HomePod's ability to hear me even over music. I can speak in a normal speaking voice and the HomePod picks it up without any trouble. No more yelling and frustration. All around for the 99% of what I use a smart speaker for (music, podcasts, timers, weather, and the occasional random question) the Siri and the HomePod actually perform very well. Sure, there are some areas that Google's AI assistant outperformed in, but honestly those are mostly in areas that I don't really use on a regular basis. I do miss being able to ask Google what a cow says, to entertain my daughter from time to time, but she'll have to settle for dad's impression of a cow until Siri supports that.Less"
5.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Life changing!,"Despite its fair share of negative reviews on many websites (from Spotify listeners and non-Apple users), I decided to buy the HomePod - my husband and I both have iPhones, iPads and are Apple Music subscribers, so it made sense to buy what has turned out to be one of the best single, home speakers on the market. We used to have an amazon Echo dot - and yes, Alexa was useful, but she certainly had her flaws! Especially when it came to playing music! Oftentimes we’d hear a “im sorry, I didn’t understand the question” reply, which can be very frustrating. However, Siri has changed our lives! I can’t tell you just how amazing the sound quality is - it’s equaliser is perfectly balanced - even in our kitchen (which naturally has echo-y acoustics) thanks to its self-calibration. The sound has an excellent bass to it, yet it doesn’t disturb our sleeping children in the evenings! And as for Siri himself (we have never been particularly impressed with his skills while using him on our phones in the past) - yet on the HomePod we haven’t had a single incorrect reply to any of our requests! And thanks to the “genius” technology, if we ask siri to “play music” he learns from our previous tastes and is absolutely spot on with his selection! Weather forecasts are thorough and very accurate, and when we ask for a news update, he plays a clip from BBC news headlines - much better than Alexa reading the highlights! We use Siri to control our home lighting (through Philips hue) and there are many other features that we absolutely love about the HomePod! Yes, if you are not an Apple Music subscriber and/or not in the Apple ecosystem, then this is not the purchase for you. I’m sure there are other very good home speakers (that are probably cheaper too) but if you are an apple-ite, then you will not regret this purchase! We will never look back! And we can’t wait for future updates to expand he capabilities of this epic speaker!Less"
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great sound!,"I purchased this speaker because I’m totally “in” Apple’s ecosystem. The sound is spectacular. It doesn’t get as loud as some speakers, but it puts out plenty of volume for a midsized room. The Siri functionality is what you’ve come to expect from Apple’s digital assistant; she’s not the smartest, but she’ll do. Sorry if my use of pronouns is offensive. What’s really amazing is how well Siri can hear no matter how loud the music/audio you have pumping. She easily hears me from a couple rooms away. It really is amazing. I have two tethered in my bedroom that play audio from my Apple TV that gives me a spectacular stereo experience. It’s a fantastic audio experience. If you find yourself surrounded by Apple devices I would highly encourage you to pick one of these HomePods up; it compliments any Apple device.Less"
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,"Excellent product, focused on security","The speaker is great, but it is more than a speaker, it is a home base for your smart home. As with most things Apple, this doesn’t play well with others. but there is a growing list of apple homekit enabled accessories. The speaker is well balanced, not all tinny like the clock radio that it replaced in my kitchen. I use it to control music with my voice while I wash dishes, put timers on my cooking tasks when i have messy fingers or full hands, and to catch up on the news and weather for the day. While i’m away from the house, it relays the information from my homekit enabled cameras by netatmo and baby monitor from arlo in the home app without sending my data through their servers. Amazon speakers want to sell you stuff from amazon, google speakers want to advertise to you, the homepod just wants to keep your stuff secure. That limits your compatibility but it is worth it to me.Less"
2.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Only for Apple Music Devotees,"Sound quality is good for a small speaker, but make no mistake, this is a small speaker... a small mono speaker. It will fill a space with music, but don't expect it to fill a room, unless the room is a closet or you have two to make it stereo. That's just the physics of sound. While you can manually stream any music or music service you like to HomePod via a Mac or iDevice you can only use Siri voice control to control music playback (performer, genre, etc) if yo have Apple Music or iTunes Match. It cannot be used to control HomeSharing, if you use that on your Apple devices. You can control volume though no matter what the source of your music. HomePod only works with AirPlay. There is no way to connect via Bluetooth or a wire. My big disappointment with HomePod, and why I ultimately gave it 2 stars, is that it's microphones to summons Siri are way too sensitive. HomePod can hear me even on floor down. The result, if I ""Hey Siri"" a question to my iPhone on the table in front of me, HomePod upstairs will answer. There is currently no setting in iCloud to lower Siri's sensitivity or disable completely and let another iDevice act as a remote. That would solve that problem. Bottomline: if you have bought into Apple Music and no chance of switching to a different service HomePod may be a good option, depending on whether you use Hey Siri on your other devices. For everyone else, while maybe not as good sounding, Sonos One with Airplay 2 support offers more versatility in connections and streaming service options.Less"
2.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,"Great sound, terrible functionality","I was excited about this purchase and was satisfied initially when I heard the sound quality. It has a very easy setup and hears your voice quite well. However, Siri seems even more limited as to what she can do on HomePod than she is on my iPhone. Also, if you want to connect anything but an Apple device with the supposed bluetooth 5.0 it has, think again. You can't. Only Apple products can be connected to it through Airplay. I wanted to use it as a home theatre system but couldn't. it will connect to my Apple TV but it won't stay connected and is ridiculously difficult to figure out how to connect in the first place. Once it loses the connection you worked so hard to get, it is even harder to figure out how to reconnect. VERY FRUSTRATING! I returned the HomePod after a week. Maybe with the next generation these issues will be addressed. Until then, HomePod is not for me.Less"
3.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,"For Mac users, seems like a beta product","As an Apple user since the mid 1980s, Ive been used to well engineered, seamless experiences. These speakers are not that. Having exhausted a search for decent 2.1 computer speakers, I took the plunge for a pair of these at the recent $250 promo. From the start, it felt like I had purchased unsupported 3rd party accessories. Once the speakers were plugged, I stood waiting for a setup screen to appear on my phone but nothing did (running the latest iOS 12.1.2). Eventually waving my phone inches from one speaker brought it up but the 1st attempt failed. Once the speakers were recognized I noticed they needed a firmware update. The update took about 45 minutes: each speaker updated independently and without any progress bar on my phone letting me know the status. Why we cant setup using a Mac is beyond me. Setting up the 2 speakers as a stereo pair also didnt immediately work, even when both were in the same Homekit room. Eventually, after relaunching Homekit a few times the software relented and I had stereo. So finally set up, I choose Airplay in iTunes on my iMac and discover I cant control the volume with my wired Apple keyboards keys. What!? My daughter walks in the room and I frantically try to mute the sound, finally resorting to yelling at Siri to stop. Pausing from keyboard does work, thankfully. Nothing works in stereo outside iTunes. And being wifi only, playing around with Garage Band or Motion (in requisite mono) introduces a 1-2 second delays so these are useless for that type of work. There are some other software glitches, such as choosing one of the speakers in System Prefs immediately stops playback from iTunes or hovering over the volume slider in itunes sometimes makes the controller bounce around like it’s reluctant to move. I know AUX in now anathema to many tech companies, but having the option would have solved most of these issues. Progress. I realize these are mostly positioned as iOS accessories, but to wave off Mac users with seeming determination seems weird, especially since Apple has had about a year since launch to iron things out. As for sound quality: to my ears they lack presence, especially in mid bass and mid highs. Theres some booming at higher volumes. Midtones and vocals are quite clear, and bass pretty good if not super deep (but still great for the size). They sound fine, just dont match the glowing reviews I read or my expectations from the brand.Less"

I wasn't much of a Siri user before, so was mostly getting this to be a network-connected speaker that integrated well with my Apple devices, but now use Siri on it regularly, including to control HomeKit devices. The setup couldn't have been easier. If you're already invested in the Apple ecosystem, and can afford the cost, getting one of these is highly recommended.

You MUST say Hey Siri or it ignores you... which is ok, but not the best. (though it does prevent unintentional commands. Wish they had a smaller echo-dot type option for other rooms where you don't need a high performance speaker.

Two speaker setup is ideal for a larger room. Apple Music subscription required. It works on airplay over WiFi and not Bluetooth. No WiFi - no music! Still a pricy option compared to other speakers. I tried my luck with a open box speaker, but it had 2 dents and a crack on the top. The store manager could have easily dropped the price of the product since it wasn’t as described, but she refused to budge. After 2 weeks with it I returned it back because I couldn’t justify paying $40 less than brand new with so many flaws. Ended up buying a new HomePod and its works great."

Apple Music is a must otherwise it is just an expensive speaker. This may be ok for some but you will be missing out on the convenience of this speaker and all that it can do. I believe you can stream Spotify and other Audio services via Airplay\bluetooth but having Apple Music and other Apple products really adds to the experience and if you don’t you’d be better looking at a different Smart Speaker in my opinion. The sound is absolutely fantastic. There’s some impressive tech going on in this gadget including spatial awareness hardware and software which means that no matter where you place the speaker it adjusts accordingly and sounds great. I also use it as an audio output for my Apple TV for Movies, Tv and Sport via ITunes, Netflix, Amazon Prime and Now tv and it improves the sound greatly with good bass and clear dialogue. Siri is good (and seems to better than on IPhone strangely) but still feels that it may be in development however I expect it to get better. Certainly very helpful as it is though. If you love your music and appreciate sound quality in your music and already use apple products (particularly Apple Music and Apple TV) then I would highly recommend.Less"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Better than expected,"The first thing that shocked me about the HomePod was the weight of the box. Then upon opening it, I was shocked by the size. I guess I was expecting something closer to the size of a Mac Pro since that's what everyone seemed to be saying it looked like. For background, I've had premium speakers before, from Bang & Olufsen to Sonos. The setup was unbelievably intuitive and easy. I just brought my iPhone towards the HomePod and a card popped up on the screen and I followed the prompts and we were all good. The minute I played music on it I was shocked by the sound and the bass. It was definitely not expected for the size. And the base isn't overly done to where it rattles or sounds raunchy. It's done to where it allows the mids and highs to still shine. I would say it tops the Sonos Play 3's I had and the Bang & Olufsen B17. Even Siri was better than expected. As I was leaving the other day, I realized I had forgotten to turn out my bedroom lights and the bedroom door was closing, so with my hands full I asked Siri to turn off the bedroom lights and I was thinking I was going to have to throw all this stuff in my hands down on the counter and use my phone (via the Hue app) but Siri actually heard me from the next room over with the door barely cracked open. The six microphones is apparently very effective. My phone actually activated as well but missed the command. The -1 star is due to AirPlay. I had an AirPlay speaker way back when and I couldn't remember why I was so disappointed with it, but now that I have a HomePod (also AirPlay) I remember very vividly why. The connection when AirPlaying constantly drops. Listening to it, I have yet to be able to listen to a full song from start to finish without the connection dropping out multiple times. For a company like Apple this is incredibly disappointing because it's becoming a habit to release products with promised features that continuously get pushed back. Recall, the HomePod itself was supposed to launch during the holidays but was pushed back, so if you had extra time, the level of expectation doesn't go down, it goes up. Having owned AirPods, which are seemingly flawless, I expected more from Apple.Less"
4.0,3 weeks ago,bhphotovideo.com,Excellent sound quality,I bought the HomePod instead of adding external speakers to my Echo. So the HomePod sound is superior to the Echo Plus by far. The voice clarity of Siri is also better than Alexa. Where HomePod doesn’t measure up is in the capabilities of Siri vs Alexa. The variety of music Stations and playlists available through Amazon is superior to those on Apple Music. Alexa can provide more responsive answers than Siri as well. So I have to be much more specific with Siri than With Alexa. My final vote is in favor of HomePod however bc of the excellent sound quality for music and speech.

Because it is limited to Siri (which is much more scaled back than other voice assistants), it does have some limitations in regards to it being a voice assistant...but, this is a speaker first and assistant way down the list. Where it shines is the ease of using the speaker with Apple Music (though other native service integrations like Spotify are coming soon). I love handing off audio from my iPhone and combining my two speakers into a ""matched pair"" so they can act as left and right channels when I really want to blast my music and have it sound the best.

The A8 chip allows for it to equalize the audio according to the space that it is in allowing a more linear frequency response. The resulting sound is rich and clear regardless of the volume. Initial setup was a breeze thanks to the ease of the Apple ecosystem with my iPhone being in close proximity to the HomePod and then automatically configuring everything. The Hey Siri detection is quite good with it being able to pick up your voice command from across an average sized room even despite the music from the HomePod playing loudly. Siri is useful in terms of navigating throughout the vast musical library of Apple Music and doing basic commands for reminders, notes, weather, directions, store hours and messages/calls. However, in terms of a global search level, Siri can not compete with the superior Google Assistant. The downside to this speaker is that it can only be used with other Apple devices and Apple Music. However as someone who has everything Apple and is deeply invested into the ecosystem, it doesn’t matter to me. If you want to play Spotify or audio from other services, you’ll have to Airplay to the HomePod. In conclusion, this is a well engineered speaker with a fairly capable voice assistant included. Probably the best sounding smart speaker out there!Less"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,A good buy if you are all in with Apple ecosystem,"The Apple HomePod is really a product for those of us who are fully immersed in the Apple ecosystem. It is the best smart speaker if you use voice command with Siri to control your smart home devices and if you are an Apple Music user. Comparing to a single Sonos One and a Jawbone Big Jambox, the HomePod sounds the best with crisp high and deep, punchy base. It also gets quite loud without distortion. One HomePod speaker can easily fill a medium size living room. The omnidirectional arrangement of the speakers and the algorithm ensures that the sound are consistent at any location in your room. Now, if you are just looking for a good wireless speaker then it gets a little more tricky to recommend the HomePod. For $50 more, you can get two Sonos Ones in stereo pair which will give an additional dimension to your music. Now with AirPlay 2 support, the Sonos Ones pair will work seamlessly with any of your Apple products, too. The Sonos also support Amazon Alexa and Spottify, which the HomePod does not. In the end, if you want seamless integration with Apple Music and Siri then the HomePod is for you. However, if you are just looking for good wireless speakers then two Sonos Ones for $50 more would be a better buy.Less"
3.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,work in progress,"work in progress. in the kitchen on a table in the middle of a room it did not sound any better than the old sangean internet radio did (before it fell and its insides shattered). but in the corner back where the stereo used to sit the sound is very good, so that is where it sits. i’ve had lots of connection issues; it seems to have poor wifi reception. its nice that it is so easy to set up because i’ve had to reset the device a dozen times. stereo pairing was the biggest problem. homepod is very balky about playing my music, especially from a computer. workaround has been to get its attention by sending it a radio stream from my iphone - once it is playing you can switch over to the computer. often it simply refuses to play anything, you tell siri “$&!@ you” and suddenly the room fills with a loud third rate commercial song with “you” in its title. apparently siri was listening all along, eager to connect you with its corporate masters. first time i managed to get both homepods to play, they were out of synch so that ot sounded like i was in vast auditorium. internet tells me that homepods out of synch is impossible. a christmas miracle? or just buggy software? currently they sort of work usually, dropping connections every few minutes to produce the aural equivalent of cubism, but they are better than the old Sangean internet radio that they teplaced. my guess is that the software and firmware will be upgraded over time and the experience will get better. the audio overall is remarkably good for small speakers - i suspect they are doing some very sophisticated wave symthesis to create proper base from reflections and stereo that you used to need a really big dumb speaker to get. i suspect that the sounds produced are as “real” as the pictures phones take with their computer aided cameras. if you want flat untreated sound, i suspect that homepod is not for you.Less"
4.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Apple Slightly Missed the Mark Here,"Okay let's start with the positive: This is the best sounding speaker on the market in this category. Better than Sonos, better than Bose, or Beats, or whatever else is out there like it. Honestly it's so frustrating because on the other hand its occasionally a pain to connect to it. I think that's true of all these devices though, but the biggest glaring issue is the fact it's not wireless and/or cordless. Why, oh, why can't I just unplug it (the charging cable is built into the dang thing) and carry it where I want? Even if it didn't have a battery, and it needed to be plugged in, I still would just buy like 2 charging cables (one inside/one outside) so I could switch between rooms easily and not unplug it from the wall each time! I hate cables and I want to be able to hide my cables, but nope, can't do it with HomePod.Less"
3.0,a year ago,Target,HomePods Require FAT Wallets,"For almost $800 (with tax) for a stereo pair these are definitely a MAX LUXURY smart-speaker purchase; one is paying an outrageous premium for the ability to talk to the main speaker [in stereo pair mode only one of the HomePods listens for queries]. Based on their sound quality, the HomePods should probably be priced at $199 each, $349 for a pair. l now have a stereo pair and consider the overall sound annoyingly lacking in treble and slightly overwhelming in bass [but then again I'm older]. HomePods are definitely not for audiophiles because the sound is too diffuse and muffled sounding. Sometimes when I AirPlay from my iPhone or iPad over to the HomePods they start up out of sync and create a non-stereo echo effect which is quite disturbing. To re-sync them to remove the echo it is necessary to add an additional output destination, such as the AppleTV, which stops the echo. The AppleTV can then be deselected. To be fair, this may be a consequence of my very old router. There are many 'Hey, Siri' commands that the HomePod just cannot figure out, an example being: 'Hey, Siri, play radio station W C N Y'. Weird. IMHO, smart speakers are a fad and will fade away. $800 can buy an entire surround-sound system for an HDTV, and who cares if you can't ask it anything.Less"
5.0,6 months ago,John Lewis,Top Quality sound,We purchased the HomePod as we were looking for a quality way to access and play music and it fulfils our expectations totally. The quality of the sound is phenomenal and built in Siri can select from the 50 million songs on Apple Music. Additionally we can airplay any other music from our devices to the speaker so potential is unlimited Currently the Siri functionality for other features lags behind Alexa and Google home but the news from Apple appears to suggest the these are on their way as future software updates so we are looking forward to that. Meanwhile the quality of the sound and meeting our music listening needs is all that we want. The HomePod was easy and straightforward to set up. All in all very pleased with this purchase. The range of smart speakers available and the advice we received in John Lewis was really helpful and enabled us to make an informed choice based on our criteria i.e. top of the range sound.Less
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Solid Performer,"These smart powered speakers (I bought a stereo pair) look great and sound great...and listen even better. At first blush the $349 price sounded very high...though I hit a $50 off sale... but when you think about it they’re not. The solid/heavy compact speakers pack a punch in the bass and with 7 folded horn tweeters fill the whole room with omnidirectional sound. Each of the 8 speakers has its own amplifier and are separately controlled by the A8 processor (same as in iPhone 6). The touch controls and discreet color display round out the package. The bass auto adjusts to room size and the 7 tweeters sense walls and beam the sound around the room...I.e. these sound great anywhere in any room at any volume (no distortion at full volume). After updating them to Airplay 2, I could use them as a stereo pair, whole house speakers that play the same or different content in different rooms or assign each to different accounts for independent control from separate user IOS, TVOS, or MacOS devices—remember these are WiFi, not Bluetooth, full range speakers (40-20kHz?). Spookily amazing are the 6 microphones that can hear and respond to your normal (inside) voice even when the speakers are creating a cathedral soundstage while playing Bach’s Toccata and Fugue in D minor at full volume. Siri easily answers queries like “what’s the weather tomorrow” when you ask from the next room. I did not have home automation devices to test, but as you can tell I’m having fun with a pair of HomePods. Just don’t think they can replace your $500+ HiFi tower speakers ... or the other way around ;?)Less"
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Great sound. Siri a little lacking,"I am a heavy Apple user so everything integrates nicely and is very easy to set up and control. I was able to connect and control all my LIFX bulbs quickly and LOVE being able to just say to turn on and off certain lights. If you have Apple Music, it is great because you can ask it to play songs, identify songs by lyrics, and add to your personal library or playlist. I think it sounds better than all of the other smart speakers and has a sleek and slim design. It isn’t the smartest speaker compared to others and is very limited on answers when asking questions that are not music related. Overall, I am satisfied with the speaker since I use it mostly for the music and podcasts and leave the heavy searching for my phone or iPad."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Excellent sound, attractive smart speaker","The HomePod sounds and looks great! I use it primarily as a speaker, but have found it to be convenient for checking weather, time, telling jokes and so on. It is very cool that I can ask a question from another room, even with some music going, and the HomePod responds. We don’t have any HomeKit automation items yet, but it seems like controlling them with HomePod voice commands should be a snap. I only have two complaints. 1) We have heard random sounds from the HomePod when it should have been not in use. The first was a kind of electric pop sound. It was startling (we were sitting near it) but there was no apparent harm to the HomePod. This has happened only once after about 4 weeks of use so far. I read about other reports of this pop sound. Maybe it is the result of a software update. Recently, I picked up a second HomePod. After just a week of use so far, it has (I think) emitted a 1- or 2-second high-pitched tone one morning at 3:30am three times about 2 minutes apart. In this case, I am not certain it was the HomePod because I couldn’t reach the HomePod quick enough to be sure, but everything else downstairs checked out fine. Again, I suspect the sound resulted from a software update. I expect Apple will resolve the sounds I described. 2) We have an immense iTunes library of both music we have imported from CD and purchased via iTunes. For many years I have used the Remote app to play music from our shared iTunes library and output to speakers around the house connected to Apple TV or Airport Express. So, it would be super convenient to ask HomePod to play music from my iMac shared iTunes library. But, you cannot start music by voice command unless you subscribe to Apple Music (maybe this will change). However, once you manually start music in your iTunes library, you can ask HomePod to skip to the next song or adjust the volume. That’s nice.Less"
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Temperamental Speakers,"I bought 4 at one time to set up as stereo pairs in two different rooms. The setup was easy. The sound is great. They work well with each of the Apple TVs they share a room with. My issue is how frequently they disconnect from WiFi. I have to restart the pairs once or twice a week. Each time I use my Apple TV 4k I have to go to the audio setting to have the sound come out of the speakers as well as the TV. Siri is not as ""smart"" as Alexa or Google which was expected prior to purchase. I purchased Homepod because I am so invested in the Apple ecosystem that it just seemed a natural addition. Outside the nuances, they perform exactly how I expected."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"HomePod is for me, sorry Google Max.","I started out with a HomePod. Eventually, I caved after reading all of these reviews on the Google Home Max and returned the HomePod to purchase the Max. I ended up regretting it of course and went right back to the HomePod after just over a week. The Google Home Max certainly feels premium and it sounds great if you sit right in front of it, but that's not ideal when moving about the home/room. Also, in the space allocated in my room, it just didn't look or sound right. The speaker sat on a desk in my room (reference photos) and then angled across the room to another much larger corner desk. The sound was inconsistent, but very pleasant if I sat directly in front of it. I enjoyed interacting and learning various aspects of Google Assistant… indeed, quit a bit more enjoyable to use than Siri outside of basic commands. I also appreciated that there was a lot of smart home support and that I could purchase cheaper Home Minis to set around the house and not break the bank. I had planned on even converting to an android phone just for better support with Google Assistant and the pursuit of a smart home (glad I didn't, actually upgraded to the iPhone X instead of S9 after ultimately deciding on the HomePod). Well, the Google Home Minis could hardly respond or hear me with music playing (they performed fairly well in a silent room). Unfortunately, the same occurred with the Google Home Max. Voice commands became a disappointing chore and I didn't like walking up to the speakers and strategizing how they could best hear me to respond since they were hit or miss when the speakers were actively playing sound... this was the fatal flaw for me… Yelling at the speaker while playing music to get a response was ridiculous. Also, there's no text support as of yet with the Google Home Max. Siri offered text support and I use it fairly regularly. I would appreciate it if the HomePod added support for initiating calls by voice as well. I also liked that Google could differentiate between various users. At the end of the day though the HomePod won my heart with such effortless and seamless use. I enjoyed being able to talk with a normal tone and use commands with Siri hearing every word while I studied to soft music, added reminders, requesting business close times and phone numbers to local stores/restaurants, giving basic calculations, listening to the news or just jamming out to an upbeat song. Another refreshing aspect of the HomePod is that it just sounds consistently amazing anywhere I am in the room and that's an all new experience for me with any sound system. It also looks descent nearly anywhere I place it due to the circular/tubular design… I appreciate not having to angle/position it. Ultimately, I choose HomePod because it just works, and it works well as a music player that can share basic info, text, set reminders/timers. My impressions were that Siri is borderline mindless compared to Google's AI, but Siri is dependable, understands me the first time and works flawlessly and beautifully with what she does do. She does most of the basic tasks I need. There may be hope for Siri in the future in regard to the lacking intelligence. Apple most certainly has the financial resources, won't sit ideally by, has the manpower to improve Siri in due time. I ask Apple to improve these things: A more interactive and intelligent Siri. Add ability to add events to a calendar. Add support for multiple users. Cheaper speakers for smart home use. Add the ability to call out with voice commands."
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,My first stumble with Apple,"First, If you are using this solely as a music player it sounds incredible. The reviews aren’t lying, it is an amazing streaming music player but problems really come into play with using it in concjunction with Apple TV. It consistently froze the image or cut off the audio, the Apple TV remote control would only occasionally control the volume of the connected homepod while watching TV, and my video quality was also sporadically decent at best when using the HomePod for my audio source. These problems only worsened with the addition of airplay 2 through an update. Basically, it failed to play audio that was not directly requested via voice through the HomePod about 30-40% of the time. I spoke with Apple several times but they never had a solution, constantly forwarding the info to the engineers but they couldn’t fix the problems either apparently. I even upgraded my router and WiFi package but with two expresses and an extreme pulling 112mbps it still wouldn’t cooperate with the Apple TV. My whole house is filled with Apple products and I’ve been thrilled with the results of all of them except this one. Depending on your intended use, it’s either a homer in or a dud.Less"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Sound,"I understand that people have reservations about the HomePod not being able to perform the duties similar to Google Home and Alexa. However, I didn't purchase the HomePod to perform all those type of duties as Alexa. I purchased it to work with my Apple Music and the sound is awesome! I added a 2nd one and paired it to my 1st one and the sound quality across the room is very impressive. My teenage kids were even impressed with the sound quality and they are very critical. As a bonus, I added Phillips Hue bridge and lighting to my home and Siri controls the lights and can control any smart device compatible with Apple HomeKit. Siri via HomePod can also provide weather, traffic, notifications, and other tasks also. If you have iPhone or iPad, you can use HomePod to hear text messages and use it as a speaker phone or bluetooth speaker to play music directly from your apple device. If you are a Apple Music user or use iPhone or iPad or use Apple HomeKit compatible smart devices, the HomePod is a great addition and compliment. I also can't say enough about the sound quality. I've heard other similar speaker's sound and they do not compare to the HomePod sound quality!!!Less"
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Amazing hardware,"Sound is incredible for the size, and the microphone array can pick up ‘hey siri’ over loud music from different rooms. The software is not perfect but very promising. When this device was first released it was the bottom of the competition for being able to answer questions. However, with a lot of new software updates it’s now at the top of the pack, just behind google’s. I would expect this to be a very solid device in the next year after Apple releases some more software updates. They seem to be developing secure voice differentiation algorithms so I’d expect support for mulptiple accounts in the next year. We shall see. Apple uses differential hashing and various other techniques to keep transmitted data secure and ananymous. This is comforting because companies like google and amazon will harvest your personal information and commands to beef their advertising platform. Allowing companies to build a psychological profile on you is how companies like Cambridge Analytica was able to manipulate so many people into digesting fake news articles. This is just the start. I’d suggest people be wary about letting companies build these profiles on them and interface them with large companies for monetary gain. That’s why I support companies like apple who keep your data private.Less"
5.0,3 weeks ago,Best Buy,Wow,This isn't your normal smart speaker. Yes I'm an avid Apple fan so it only made since to get an Apple speaker. I only use Apple music too so this only made since to buy an Apple product. Setup was easy and especially using HomeKit has made it even easier while away from the house. The sound quality is superb! Just enough bass and the tweeters get the job done. I see a lot of reviews that talk about Siri and it not 100% but I don't use Siri anyways so this didn't distract me to buy. I'll be purchasing another one soon. Best speaker I have ever own and totally worth the money with using it as more than a speaker but also home security while away.
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Excellent sounds and voice recognition,"I now have four HomePods located throughout my house (all white) and I love the convenience of it. We use it all the time both to control HomeKit devices (Selena shades, various lights, etc.) and to play music. The sound quality is excellent to our ears (though none of us is an audiophile), particularly when two nearby HomePods are playing together. Its nice to be able to say Hey Siri, play playlist so-and-so everywhere and instantly have our home come alive with music. Interestingly, we dont have to raise our voices to give Siri commands even when the music is quite loud. Until now Id not enabled Personal Requests because the first three HomePods are located in shared spaces, but this fourth one is in my office, and the Personal Requests are pretty useful there. I also use it as an over-the-top-quality speakerphone extension there (I can tell it Hey Siri, Call John X and it places the call for me while I keep on typing an e-mail or whatever). Ive found no real downsides in the year we have had these devices. Id love for Siri to understand more complex queries, though; its pretty impressive already, but I still have to be somewhat careful how I structure my command.Less"
3.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Fantastic audio tightly locked to Apple ecosystem,"As many have said, the sound out of HomePods is just simply incredible. If you only want to ever play music to them from an Apple device/service, buy these. Buy two even for stereo pairing. But thats about it. I would only recommend these to Apple fans (which I am, btw) as HomePod is probably the most Apple locked-in product Apple has ever made. I will say a few songs dont play fantastically on these and I have yet to figure out why. Could be HomePods auto-sensing of room dimensions and some songs just didnt mesh with HomePods analytics. Really only a small minority of songs with this issue, but when it happens, youll notice. You can send an EQ setup to HomePod when playing from iTunes, but only once per AirPlay connection. If you want to listen to a variety of music with different EQ settings in one sitting this is very annoying. The stereo setup could be a little easier, but if you are familiar with Apples Home app on an iOS devices then you will be able to figure it out. Also HomePod doesnt go as loud as I would like if I really want to crank the music up. That all being said, my HomePods have had absolutely amazing audio for the vast majority of my listening. Really, really stunning! The bass is mind blowing for such tiny devices. The integration with Siri services is impressive. I like that my iPhone and HomePod can figure out which should be listening for Hey, Siri! automagically when in the same room. There are limitations to what Siri can help you with on HomePod. Because HomePod doesnt have a normal screen to show Siri answers that include a lot of detail, some requests are just answered with I cant answer that on HomePod. Really it should offer to hand off to another Apple device when this happens. Maybe Apple will tweak this in the future. But weather reports, setting cooking timers, misc. small helpful things like that are solid as Siri always is. One really notable Siri feature is the ability to still take voice commands even when also playing loud music. How does it do that?! I would say HomePod as of right now (late 2018) is really a 0.9 version. Just not quite done. If Apple ever gets really serious about HomePod and adds some software tweaks these could be incredible. For now they are amazing speakers, but tech-wise mostly a novelty. I will be keeping mine, but I can only recommend buying HomePod if you are already all-in on the Apple ecosystem (or want to be)."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Sounds great!,"I purchased a HomePod on launch day and have listened to more music since that day than ever before. I used to use Spotify, but it was never convenient to make my own playlists. I did not like Spotify’s playlists or radio, but Apple Music via Siri has been great! The radio stations stick to the genre better, and it is easy to trigger them anywhere in room with voice. Classical and jazz music sound great coming from the HomePod. The highs are very clear and the bass is solid but not too boomy. I also have a Google Home Max, so can compare both speakers. The Max has bigger woofers so it sounds better with HipHop / Rap or Electronic Dance Music. There is more bass on the Max, but the highs aren’t as clear as the HomePod. I decide to keep both... I use the HomePod mostly for quiet and calm music such as classical or jazz, and use AirPlay to stream from YouTube, Tidal, take phone calls, etc. I now use the Max for more party type music and asking Google questions. The mics on the HomePod are better than Max and can hear me at full volume, but the Max cannot hear at full volume unfortunately. I recommend the HomePod with a Google Home Mini on side if music quality is primary focus and don’t need a lot of bass and want some additinal smart features. Eventually maybe HomePod Siri will be able to handle questions better and won’t need a Google Home product also, but for now the sound is good enough alone to justify keeping it.Less"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Audio - Tricky HomeKit Support,"I bought this HomePod primarily to control our HomeKit Smart Home Devices (Phillips Hue lights, Ecobee Thermostat) without having to always have a phone or tablet on us. On first install, the HomePod wanted to set itself up as the primary Hub for our devices. We already had an Apple TV set up as the primary Hub, and the HomePod seemed to fight it for supremacy, leaving us unable to remotely connect to our Smart Home devices. After I disconnected and reconnected the HomePod, it seems to be playing nicely with the Apple TV and we’re able to control things remotely again. When we are home, the HomePod controls everything very well, and it’s nice for every member of the family to be able to ask Siri to turn smart devices on and off. As far as music quality, HomePod has been touted as the best audio quality in a smart speaker - it certainly sounds much better than the little Google Home Mini we have in one of the bedrooms. We previously had a UE Megaboom in the Living Room where the HomePod is, and I don’t know if I’m enough of an audiophile to tell much difference. The Megaboom always sounded great - the HomePod sounds great.Less"
2.0,9 months ago,walmart.com,"Decent speaker, sub-par smart home control.","For $299, I need a little bit more than just good sound quality. The Echo Plus, Echo Show 2, and most Google Home speakers have built in Zigbee hubs. This allows me to control my Phillips Hue, C by GE, Ring, and other smart home devices without having to buy and use their hubs which can cost about $50 and clutter up a home. I like the Google Home Hub and Echo Show 2 because they allow me to make hands free video calls and watch my security camera and door bell's live feeds. both Google Home and Alexa allow you to link multiple speakers for an in-home intercom system, or all around surround sound. The Google Max and Echo Plus subwoofer give you amazing sound. For the price, I prefer my Echo."

Additionally, while watching my Apple TV, I can add the HomePod as an additional speaker along with my Bose sound bar. Talk about making good sound even better! I’m also quite happy with Siri performance. I had read some negative reviews on how much catching up Apple has to do to make Siri more on par with other digital assistants, but as far as running my HomeKit compatible devices, I’m thrilled with Siri’s accuracy and performance. To really enjoy, you’ll want an Apple Music subscription. Pretty much opens up every kind of music imaginable. I wish the price was lower, although it’s worth the money just for the sound quality. Just make sure you DO NOT buy anything from Nest if you want to automate through HomeKit using Siri on the HomePod. Although they have hinted at HomeKit support for a LONG time, there’s no indication Nest cares to be part of the Apple ecosystem (they’re owned by Google, so duh). Unfortunately, Apple is the only company I can thoroughly trust to honor my privacy, so if it’s not HomeKit compatible, I will not buy it. Thankfully there are MANY great alternatives to Nest that ARE HomeKit compatible!Less"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Good... for its size,"It is small and convenient, and it sounds pretty much the same from all directions. Considering that it is a small, single speaker, it sounds shockingly good, but it does not sound like you have nice speakers. Sound quality is definitely inferior to my (reasonably nice) Craigslist bookshelf speakers attached to one of the cheapest amps I could find on amazon (total cost- maybe $250). There is simply no comparison. Each of the bookshelf speakers are three times the size of the HomePod, and there are two of them, so it isn’t a fair comparison. Just don’t expect it to replace even a budget stereo system. I can’t compare it to other smart speakers, but I hear it sounds the best sounding of the smart speakers. I’ll believe it, and it really is impressive for its size. But the the key phrase there is “for its size”. It does play music in all directions, so the HomePod really shines when you are moving around (most speakers only sound good when you are in front of them). Voice recognition is good, but I don’t really see the big appeal of talking to a speaker, it is usually easier to just use your phone. I’ll keep the HomePod in the kitchen, and I do like it. Just be aware that many of the reviews you see online really overstate how good it is. It is small, convenient, and sounds pretty good. It gets louder than I’d get away with living in an apartment, but it is not great audio quality.Less"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great as a sound bar for Apple TV,"Many would be hesitant to spend $300 on a smart speaker with so many more affordable options available (and rightly so), but you’re already invested in the Apple ecosystem and care about great sound quality you won’t be disappointed. I have a 2 HomePod setup that I use as a sound bar, and have been very pleased with experience so far. A commonly overlooked feature is that it supports playback controls with your voice, so if you need to pause or play the tv, just ask Siri! Keep in mind, this speaker is not a Bluetooth speaker. Apple uses Airplay 2 exclusively to deliver the highest sounds quality and greater range of connection. If you already have other Apple products and don’t plan to change, I say try it out!"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Audio in a Class by Itself,"I preordered an Apple HomePod from Best Buy. Picked it up on Friday after work. Early Saturday morning I was at Best Buy buying a second one before they sold out. Yes, the sound was really that good! I own a number of Amazon echo devices including several Echo Show and several Google Home devices. Alexa and Hey Google outperform Siri. But if you’re buying this for sound, nothing even comes close. The sharp, clear high frequencies because of the seven tweeters which are computer controlled cannot be duplicated by any other device on the market today. I do not subscribe to Apple Music. I listen to SiriusXM through my computer using iTunes, and distribute it to these HomePod speakers wirelessly, using the Apple lossless wireless system. That gives an additional benefit of being able to adjust equalization through iTunes. The resulting sound is phenomenal! Please note that after purchasing these two HomePod speakers, Apple updated the firmware. They still do not have stereo capability, but they reduced the bass because a number of people thought there was too much bass! I thought it was perfect before, so I simply bumped up the equalization through iTunes and I’m back to where it was before. Don’t even worry about the stereo consideration. Each speaker fills the room and sounds so multidimensional, you will think you have surround sound from HomePod. Crisp in your face audio in every area of your room! Highest Recommendation!!Less"
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Great Sound, but a few Flaws.","I am a Apple geek for sure. I don't own everything they make but I am pretty loyal at this point to Apple products. I have a bunch of bluetooth speakers and wanted to try to see how it compares to some of the powerhouse ones I already have like the new Bose line. Overall I think the sound from the speaker is impressive but I think the Apple screwed up on a few things. One, the speaker isn't portable. It has to be plugged in at all times so to me it is very cumbersome. I love my Bose because I can pick it up and take it anywhere with me and it'll have great sound in my room. The homepod basically has to stay in one spot. It would have benefited greatly from a charging station. It produces great sound. Probably some of the best I've heard from a speaker, but for 350 dollars I feel like it could be better overall. When I play music and then switch to a facebook video there is considerable lag in the sound, and it's not easy to switch off that device because the Homepod is considered under a Home device and not a bluetooth device. It is nice that the homepod can play music on its own sans your phone if you talk to it and say ""Hey siri play Ray Lamontange"". But it only plays apple music, no pandora or spotify. I do have to say the Apple to me is really good at releasing products, but usually I wait until the second or third version before I buy a new product. Look at the difference between the first apple watch and the third series now. The third series is what the watch should have been from the get go. I think the same applies to this speaker. In 2 years they will release a speaker that is portable, smaller, and can produce the same amount of sound and that will be the one I ultimately buy.Less"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"An Excellent Speaker, a Not So Excellent Assistant","I want to like this so much more than I am able to. First the good stuff. This is a fantastic speaker. The HomePod coupled with Apple Music is a great combination. The music fills the room, is rich, and clear. I have tried several standalone speakers, most connecting through Bluetooth, and the HomePod has bested them all in sound quality. Now the not-so-good stuff. Siri, the familiar assistant, is nearly impotent. There’s almost nothing outside of playing music that it has successfully performed for me. And even in the music area it falters. For example, I figured surely Siri and the HomePod could create a station or play an audiobook, but it can’t. At least it can’t play an Audible audiobook (which, honestly, I half expected as Audible is Amazon’s app). Siri can’t do anything in my house with the smart devices I have set up, whereas Alexa is all over it. Alexa is straight up better than Siri by light years. My hope is that Apple will get on the ball and roll out a great update that will drastically improve the HomePod’s assistant abilities...but, I’m not holding my breath. And that’s a shame, because this area seems right up Apple’s ecosystem alley, connecting and supporting all of it’s technology in a well integrated system. This feels like a gaping hole in that system out of which Amazon is siphoning valuable potential. Meanwhile, Amazon’s Alexa is adding Apple Music to its repertoire soon. I’ve adopted Alexa now for my smart home gadgetry, and it’s going to be tough for Apple to pry me loose from it, even if they start showing some love to the HomePod assistant functionality. But, man, that HomePod speaker? And having two in a stereo pairing? Amazing.Less"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,The hype is true,"First off, I’ll say that the hype about the sound quality of the HomePod is true. It sounds incredible. As a musician and someone who has dabbled in studio recording, I care about and pay attention to sound quality. And, for the price, the HomePod has excellent sound quality. I also have a Bose SoundTouch 10 and a Sonos Playbar. This speaker truly blows the Bose out of the water—and I’m not one for exaggeration. The dynamics and depth of the HomePod simply cannot be matched by the SoundTouch. The HomePod has crisp highs and booming lows coupled with a spaciousness that seems to surround you. Even my wife, who doesn’t pay much attention to sound quality, can notice the difference. Interestingly, the HomePod holds its own against the Sonos Playbar. The Playbar is louder and has better stereo separation (which are both to be expected). However, the HomePod holds its own, even as a single mono speaker. As far a the “smarts” of the HomePod, it suffices for my needs. I use the Home app and have several HomeKit products. My HomePod can control my lights, locks, thermostat, and sprinklers without much issue—though, it’s not perfect. Sometimes it can’t communicate with my devices; but, it works far more than it does not. And the microphone on this speaker is amazing. It can hear you without a problem from across the room with loud music playing. I do wish the HomePod could play live radio. That would make it a more complete home speaker. Additionally, I wish Apple opened it to native Spotify streaming (which is extremely unlikely to happen). As an Apple Music user, this doesn’t bother me, but in my opinion, it does affect the overall experience with the speaker and should be noted. The HomePod is a powerful speaker that simply works. It can play any audio via AirPlay 2, including audio from Apple TV. At regular price, the HomePod is expensive. If you can pick it up on sale, I highly recommend it.Less"
4.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,"A pair is better than one, but may not blow you away","I just purchased my 2nd HomePod to setup a stereo pair in our family room. I sat each speaker on top of my existing Paradigm speakers which I use for the surround sound system. Here is what I like: Siri is responsive to most commands and she will play music that meets your current demands, assuming you have Apple Music. Airplay-ing music from your phone/computer is very easy to do. The sound is very good for most listening, except serious listening (see below). Setup is very easy and there is no need for tweaking, except volume setting. What I don't like: My spouse is named 'Sherry' and I'm prone to saying 'Hey, Sherry...', which activates the HomePod every time. It's amusing to hear some of her responses, but I wish this would be fixed. The sound from the speakers is very good in general. I hear a wide soundstage, as my speakers are about 12 feet apart. Resolution of the instruments is fine, but I'm missing the feeling of 'depth'. I can sense the instrument location but I lose the space (air) around it. If you have excellent speakers or headphones, you know what I mean. I think this may be due, in part to some high frequency drop off. I miss the very bottom bass octave which can only be felt by a good subwoofer. And, at this point, I don't think the Homepods can be paired with any subwoofer. The two Homepods playing a movie soundtrack on ATV don't match the impact of my existing surround system. Since this stereo pairing hasn't 'blown me away', I may separate the two Homepods and place one in the kitchen and one in the office.Less"
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Replaced my Sonos system and an Echo,"I got 4 of these to replace 3 Sonos speakers and one sound bar on my TV. (1 in the kitchen, 1 in the dining room and 2 combined as a stereo pair under the television). Comparing the sound to the Sonos play:1 speakers, they are quite a bit better. I can hear much more bass and the sound is more omnidirectional. The integration to my Apple ecosystem is much nicer that the Sonos app as well. I have apple music; the combo with the homepods is just super. I basically use Siri to play or find whatever I want to listen to. It took me some fiddling around over a couple days to completely figure out how to use airplay to play music from each particular homepod. Now that I learned how to do it, it works very well. Playing the TV sound through the paired speakers works out well too. Sometimes the AppleTV sound output changes from homepod to HDMI all on its own for some reason. When that happens I have to switch it back manually. Probably some fine tuning by Apple needs to be done in this area. I will probably buy more to make stereo pairs in every room as they sound even better this way. By the way I also replaced an Amazon Echo with these in the process. The microphones on these pick up our voice better than the echo.Less"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great speaker but Siri still lacking,"All of my smart equipment supports Apple Homekit and everyone in the house uses iPhones, iPads, Apple TVs, etc so it made sense to get a HomePod to replace my Google Home. Siri isn't as good as the Google Assistant but the sound that comes from the HomePod, in my opinion, is infinitely better and more than makes up for it. It works as a hub for all of my HomeKit equipment which means I can set up automations and control smart devices when I'm outside the house. The ""Hey Siri"" functionality is so good that you can have music so loud and can barely hear your own voice and you can speak at a normal level and it'll hear you. If you plan to use it mainly for music and you already have Apple devices then this will be perfect for you."
1.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Remember when Apple Anticipated Needs? Not anymore,"I'm extremely dissapointed in the lack of thought put into ""families"" using homekit and homepod. There is not an option to this date STILL for having more than one ""owner"" of a ""homekit home"" so even if my partner sets up the home in homekit for a home we both share and own and sends me an invite where I can edit and add devices I am still considered a ""guest"" in my own home. This made me mad but didn't really cause too much of an issue UNTIL I purchased the overpriced HomePod not-so-smart speaker as a surprise today for my fiance who is out of town for 5 weeks. I rushed to pick it up.... I rushed it back home... I opened it with excitement to set it up and guess what? I am not ""allowed"" to add it to my homekit and set it up because I'm not the ""owner"" of the ""home"". He11 if I'm not. The not so smart suggestion from the apple card on my screen tells me to simply have the ""owner"" use his phone to set it up. Oh really? He is currently in Guam. EVEN if I did have him set it up or if I sign into my ipad or one of the iphones here as him and set it up I have read that it completely makes it worthless for anything more than a speaker at home for the rest of us. It's personalized to that user for reading their texts and setting appointments etc so my own playlists and using it for anything more than just airplaying or requesting a song it is not able to do. How is it that my phone can recognize my face but a speaker that can hear and answer you from across the room with the volume all the way up cannot determine if I'm ""owner 1"" or ""owner 2"" For a fraction of the price other hubs have this technology. So my alternative? I can set up another home on my phone and set it up but I can't add any of my homekit appliances, lights, switches, outlets, (and we have several as avid apple people) to this ""home"" without losing them from the other homekit ""home"". It's like it was created as a glorified speaker for single people who don't like to share. I'm really furious, honestly. I expected forward thinking and insight. I expected this EXTREMELY obvious issue to be thought of in advance. I expected quality and more from apple especially with how late they are to the Home Hub party. I envisioned having one in the bedroom, living room and kitchen. Ambient sound throughout where he can have his music playing in the bedroom and ask siri to play a video on the apple tv (which it cannot do wtf) while I listen to my music in the kitchen while cooking and then ask siri to call my mom so I can ask about a recipe (it can't do that either) meanwhile in the living room the kids ask siri about the weather (which is one of the few things it seems to be able to do) How did this get released and miss the mark by so very much? I don't think my vision is anything beyond what should be expected. I'm willing to pay for 3 of the darn things but somehow they cannot get the basic functionality that other hubs can provide. But it sounds good? Yeah, I wouldn't know since I'm not allowed to set it up, at least not in the way that I had wanted. The design is pretty. Good thing it's round since google and alexa are running circles around it."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Better than expected. Added a few tips.,Works very well with all three people in household. After getting it set up it recognized all three of use when speaking. I have three networks on different bands and it chose the 2.4ghz band when setting it up. I had my phone on the 5ghz band and the hand off would not work. Be sure to have phone on the same band/network. When setting it up be sure to choose which network band you want cause the only way to change it is a complete reset. Sound is very clear and good clear bass for its size. It will pick up the hey siri comand from another room with a normal low voice with music playing loud. Use the command (Set volume to 50%) to change or set volume. Hope this helps!!
3.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Great sound BUT also device issues,"I have two of these in my home. I own many Apple products so it makes sense I would have this product as well. Also, I do subscribe to Apple Music. It's a beautifully design product and the sound is amazing. However, it's UI is still a little buggy at times and most recently wifi connectivity issues have started up. It may very well be my AT&T internet but all other non-apple device's (expect for Amazon Echo) work without any issues. I believe it has something to do with the 2.4 vs. 5 ghz. dual band technology. Apple products seem to bounce around back and forth resulting in lost connection. I'm forced to unplug and reset and it's becoming annoying. This also happens to the Amazon device."
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Sound Quality is excellent,"I got this on Feb 9th. One of the best compact speaker i ever had. The bass is so beautiful, every crisp sound is noticed in this Home pod. Siri is ""OK"" but not great it cannot do like what iphone siri can do with 3rd party apps. But the only thing it lacks compared to other devices like Amazon,google is it only works with apple devices and very few other devices that support home kit feature. No bluetooth feature. Remember if you want best sound from this device that covers your entire room/hall, home pod should be placed in corner of the room. Overall the Audio quality is great. Of course money comes to play, you can buy echo, google home ranging 50 $ -150$..but you need to spend 350 $ on Home pod which is more than twice or thrice. I would say if you use apple phone/ipad/apple tv then go for home pod. Or else go for other ones. One more thing Home pod will play songs only from your apple library with apple music subscription .Even though you have songs downloaded from your personal PC to iphone via itunes library. Home pod cannot recognize those songs automatically, which is weird. For me i feel like apple is stressing to shop/purchase more apple products to use its own things. That is a strategy but down the road it will be frustrating to apple users who are switching to samsung devices etc. Eg: if you have apple watch, apple home pod, iphone and you think of switching your iphone to samsung/LG. you neither can use apple watch or home pod. All are useless, it will strictly bind your mind to use apple phones. That is bad.Less"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Opened up my world to playing music all the time,"Once apple finally updated to multi room and Stero connection, I bought a total of three (thinking about a 4th for the office) First one I got because I am a masseur and got tired of using my iPad to play music. Sound is so great and it can be heard over the Air-Conditioner. I have two more in the living room, before I lived in Air-Pods listening to music because I didn't want to turn on the TV and play Apple Music through that and have the TV running as well. But I must warn you it will cause you to buy smart lightbulbs because you can control them with your voice. The downsides???? Sometimes Siri has an Alzheimers and forgets what certain lighting scenes are (you have to unplug and replug it to show it who is boss) The other thing is if your using just voice to ask for particular type of music or playlist... it can be quite hilarious/frustrating from time to time. Also as I have YouTube Premium, I sometimes stream music channels from the iPad - once in awhile the HomePod loses the connectivity to the stream...not sure why. All in all, if you are not an Apple Music Subscriber, don't get these. Also, I wouldn't recommend them to replace your TV Soundbar... there is a software problem and using them that way to watch TV/Movies creates a muffled sound.Less"
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Excellent Smart Speaker,"I have never heard a smart speaker sound this good. My jaw dropped when I first heard it. It’s just weird hearing that amount of sound and that much clarity coming out of something this size. But it was pretty heavy. I have lots of echo devices of all kinds and a few other smart speakers and nothing comes close. Plus it seems to work better as a HomeKit controller than the AppleTV for smart home devices. I finally bought this when the price went down and I was thinking I’d regret it even then. Honestly, if I would have known what this was, I would have paid the higher price even. Amazingly good. I ended up getting a second one too."
2.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Meh... just meh... Who cares what Siri can do?,"I bought the HomePod knowing it had many limitations including the fact that if you used anything but AppleMusic, you were screwed. No problem because AppleMusic is all I use. After hearing a display unit, I decided that the sound quality was good enough. My biggest issue with any single speaker is the lack of stereo separation. There's nothing worse to me than muffled, crappy sound quality. The HomePod sounds good for most songs. I'm a fan of the 70's and early 80's singer/songwriter stuff and some of it just doesn't sound all that good on this thing. AppleMusic's collection doesn't help in that volume levels are all over the place. Huge inconsistencies require that you turn on sound check which may have something to do with the sound quality. I bought the HomePod after iOS 11.3 was released. This version allows for controlling the HomePod from an iOS device like your iPhone, but figuring out how to get to it was a pain. Once you know, it isn't horrible. Unfortunately, if you have an AppleWatch, the only way to use it to control the HomePod is to first connect to the HomePod from you iPhone. The problem is that the connection isn't stable and doesn't last. Within a song or two, you have to go back through the steps of connecting to the HomePod. Very annoying and frustrating. While the concept of just telling it to play something custom for you is nice, there are times when I want a specific playlist, and I want to pick the playlist from a device. I also want to control the volume from a device rather than having to speak my command. This is especially important if I'm on a call and perhaps the next track is a bit too loud. I can't pause the caller and say ""Hey Siri, volume down"". And due to the fact that the iPhone won't stay connected to the HomePod, you have to go through all the stupid steps of connecting to it before you can turn the volume down. I have also been experiencing issues with the HomePod just stopping. This mostly happens when I've connected my iPhone and then chosen a playlist. It will play one song and then start to play the next track and go silent. I either pickup the phone and press play (or go through the steps to reconnect it first and then press play) or I yell ""Hey Siri Play"". And yes, I yell it because I'm so frustrated and annoyed by that point. I personally don't care how limited Siri is. I own an Echo and quite frankly rarely use it as I find it annoying. All I care about is playing my music on a good to great sounding speaker, and being able to control that music with a device, be it my iPhone or AppleWatch. Until things change, HomePod is a bummer and waste of money. Due to the technology inside, I believe the device has the potential to be great, but who wants to wait for Apple, especially since they never share timelines or specifics as to updates. I've decided this thing is going back to the store. Being an early adopter with new Apple tech is just not worth it anymore."
5.0,2 months ago,ebay.com,Id wanted one for a long time,"Before the HomePod, Id used some Bose speakers to play music from my iPhone. I found a bargain on a slightly used HomePod and bought it. Since it had been used on a different WiFi system, I had to figure out how to reset it. After that, setup was very simple. The sound is so much better than the Bose speakers, I threw them away. Now, I get the news, listen to music, add items to my shopping list, make phone calls, listen to podcasts, etc from this wonderful device. I love that I can give instructions while its playing music, and it can hear and understand me from across the room. In summary, Im very happy with this purchase."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Awesome Sound! Just needs Bluetooth.,"The HomePod is a fantastic “smart” speaker with incredible fidelity and range. Paired with Apple Music it’s super easy to use, as long as Siri understands. Apple could make this even better and more universal if they open up Bluetooth for non airplay and allowed 3rd party apps to work with it directly without needing to use an iPhone to airplay music from my Plex music library for instance or any other audio (I.e. TuneIn radio support). The hardware can do it, if only apple allowed it. Super wish list, Apple should make the HomePod at as a WiFi mesh network! They’d sell so many more it would be crazy!"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Wonderful sound quality when run in pair,"I already own 1 Apple HomePod for months and have been looking for good opportunity to get the second unit. I saw this >30% discount from Best Buy and bought without hesitation. No regret. Apple HomePod running in stereo mode is really a different level of enjoyment. The sound quality is wonderful. Handoff feature is ""magical"" especially how HomePod also support radio stations from TuneIn and others. Only 1 less satisfactory point is the connection between HomePod drops once a while and reconnected after few seconds."
5.0,a month ago,John Lewis,Excellent,"I have no idea why this gets at times average reviews. I auditioned a lot of wireless speakers of various sizes and prices. Sonos, Audio Pro, Ultimate Ears, Naim to name a few. For the size of the speaker the audio is outstanding. It really does not lack in any area. Sure, it’s Apple-centric. If you want to stream by Airplay or subscribe to Apple Music it’s all you need. Siri is great. The speaker is very well made. Beautiful construction. I have white. Blends in to home. Nothing more to say really other than I really don’t think you could get better audio in one little speaker unless you say spend up to £750-1000. It’s rock solid."
5.0,7 months ago,ebay.com,Works better/easier than expected,"It just works. Simple to setup and simple to add devices to. Two weaknesses that I wasn't aware of before buying. 1. You can only connect one phone account to the HomePod, but multiple can control via voice control. Not a deal breaker, but it would be nice if all of the devices on your home would be able to pair with it. 2. Doesn't create audible alerts for intercom function or an audible ""beep"" from a sensor being triggered. Overall the sound quality is better than the BOSE Companion speakers it replaced. The bass isn't anything to joke about, good low end and great overall sound."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,A tip if you got a used one sold as new like I did,"Took advantage of the $100 discount on Black Friday, as I've heard nothing but good on the HomePod. When I picked it up in the store, I noticed on the way back to my vehicle that no shrink wrap was on the box. ""Strange"", I thought. Then when I got home and powered it up it wouldn't connect easily like the instructions said, and is typical for Apple products in general. After several attempts of getting my iPhone to see the device I reset the HomePod and then it worked as expected. I assume I was sold a used device and it was still associated to the previous owner's Apple account and WiFi. To reset HomePod, hold glowing button in middle of top upon powering up the unit until you hear Siri say ""You are about to reset HomePod"" (about 3-4 seconds) and then it will work as normal. Also, you may need to install an update once setup with your iCloud account to enable AirPlay2, which enables multi-speaker usage from your iOS devices. So if you have one that doesn't seem to work as expected, try resetting it before returning it to the store. If you do return it, please reset it for the next owner that doesn't read this review. By the way, the speaker works wonderfully and Siri is so much better on HomePod than on my iPhone or iPad it isn't even funny.Less"
5.0,6 months ago,ebay.com,Excellent speakers,"Great sound quality. They are really made for music. Siri and HomeKit also get a whole new level, the microphones are very sensitive and always responds to hey Siri. It also works as a HomeKit hub, and extend Bluetooth range, so now I have coverage all over my apartment. They are a bit expensive, since you really want them everywhere :-) especially I want to have pairs in bedroom and living room for stereo sound. I hope apple develops surround sound capabilities too, then they would be perfect as sounds bars as well. At the moment they are not so good to connect to a tv and have movies sound since they lack this."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Sounds great! But isn’t very portable speaker.,"Sounds great! But it won’t work at hotel rooms; it doesn’t use Bluetooth so it’s not good for traveling. It communicates to your iPhone through the router and hotel routers have extra security that blocks the communication. There may be a work around (read something on the net) but I haven’t tried it yet. At first setup, it seemed that only Apple Music would work. Not true! If you use Napster like I do, you use AirPlay not Bluetooth. You simply start the Napster app on your iPhone, swipe from bottom of iPhone screen to top and a controll screen appears. The top right box will represent the app currently in use (Napster) you must tap the top right of that box(it has a couple of radar like lines) to open it. Once opened, the bottom of it should show an iPhone icon with a check mark next to it. Below it should be a HomePod symbol with no check mark, tap the HomePod symbol. The check mark should now be next to the HomePod symbol. Music will now play through the HomePod. If some apps don’t work this way then look for a box shape with triangle over it (AirPlay symbol) and tap it and you should get the option to select HomePod as speaker choice. I held back a star because it lacks a speaker jack and or Bluetooth which could have made it more versatile. Sounds great though!!!. It’s best for home use with home router and Apple Music.Less"
5.0,7 months ago,John Lewis,Love the pod.,"I'm an apple person though and through, love the homepod, would hate to be without it. I've set the voice to an Australian accent, just for the heck of it, he makes me smile. Regular requests are adding to shopping, asking for tracks or playlists to be played, news, digital radio, weather, tell me a joke, what's in my diary today and it turns on/off lights. . .the list of help is endless. Sleek design and its quick to move a pod and set up a stereo pair when you have a gathering. It is only as good as your internet connection so with our's it sometimes cuts out. The only downside is that it feels like you could damage the speaker when you move it, so I'm careful to tilt it into my palm and not pressure it with fingertips. Sound is amazing, well worth the money."

The Siri functionality, although limited at first, has consistently been improved via software updates. I am thoroughly immersed in the Apple ecosystem thus its smart speaker was a logical choice for me. When I saw Best Buy’s $199 price, I didn’t hesitate to purchase an additional one. It works very well as a stereo pair with my original HomePod thus providing an even fuller, richer sound experience. If you already have additional Apple products, you can’t go wrong with this speaker."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Does all I need,"First thing -- Apple HomePod is meant for Apple Music subscribers and those who want to listen to music in their house in the background every day, while cooking, working, playing, relaxing and anything else you do at home where music can enhance an activity. (Dancing like no one is watching included.) Second, it is the most useful if you have Apple and/or HomeKit products. You will need an iPhone or iPad to even set it up. Siri may not be the brightest, but frankly I don't need to order an Uber, buy Amazon stuff sight unseen or have a pressing need to know a Ferret's average length. I love the HomePod so much I bought two! Yes, I am anxious for Apple to update the software for stereo and house connected music playing, but I am ok with waiting because I get so much benefit from it now. It is liberating to be able to play music - any kind I wish to hear at any volume I desire - by simply asking Siri. I love adding reminders, using the timer and alarms, and, yes, I have asked Siri to do a measurement calculation for me while I am cooking. I have Hue lights throughout the house and it is wonderful to just speak into the air and have the lights turn off or on. Does anyone really need the convenience ? Of course not. But once you get used to integrating ""Hey Siri ...."" into your daily life, it feels like it has always been that way. A small step towards the Jetson's way of life. Now if only I could purchase a flying car...Less"
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Sonos Play 1 sounds better,"The sound of the speaker is very subjective. And all of the early reviews came out people are making comments about how it sounds so clear and that if you close your eyes you would think you were at the concert. I don’t hear any of that. Some of the tech writer The sound of the speaker is very subjective. And all of the early reviews came out people were making comments about how it sounds so clear and that if you close your eyes you would think you were at the concert. I don’t hear any of that. Let’s just say I lost a lot of respect for some of the tech writers after they review of this product. It just sounds OK. I do think the Sonos play one sounds better and much better. Some people were comparing the HomePod sounded as good the play 5. I would say these people absolutely wrong! You cannot adjust the EQ at all. I prefer less bass and more treble, but you are stuck with how Apple wants you to hear it. It often sounds muffled to me and not clear and crisp like other reviews were saying the week it came out. Also, different genres of music sounds different than others. I believe this is a result of their computational audio. This needs to be fixed in my opinion. I think computerized sound is not the best idea when it comes to speakers. It is priced too high for what you get. This Siri capability is no different then on your iPhone. I was trying to make a justification for keeping it as a HomeKit hub, but everything I ask the HomePod to do you could simply do the same with your iPhone. I am a huge Apple fan, but cannot give the HomePod a good review. If you’re buying it strictly for the quality of sound the Sonos play one blows it away. If you’re buying it as a personal assistant others are much better. However, I do trust Apple and Siri from securities Much more than Amazon or Google so there is something to say for that. I’m sure it will get better as time goes on, but it’s not there yet. I think the build up of how good it sounded as a speaker is grossly exaggerated.Less"
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,It is so worth it!,"I debated buying Homepod since learning of its creation way back in the day, and even after it dropped tossed and turned over it. I honestly wish I had bought it sooner. If you enjoy quality sound when listening to your music and don’t have a problem with Apple then Homepod is right for you. Siri is so much more helpful and responsive via Homepod, even at max volume she can hear you say “hey siri.” Homepod isn’t like Google or Alexa and what I mean by that is Homepod’s focus isn’t on being a massive online search engine but don’t underestimate her, Siri has a few tricks of her own. One last point to make is that Homepod doesn’t feel creepy. Siri doesn’t feel like she is always listening to you, and that makes me happy. The final product totally justifies the cost."

Being Mono sounds like Stereo. Siri can be controlled from the other side of the room at normal voice volume. Sometimes it is difficult for Siri to pick a particular album or song. For Classical music, it is impossible to get a specific version of a musical work. It knows the player, not the composer. But there are thousands of 1st sonata... Pre-made playlists by mood or function are great. Always something nice to listen, at a whim, with on effort. Great buy. Superb present for an iPhone owner."
4.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Great Sound Quality,"I was hopeful the price would come down. I patiently waited and it did. I own an Apple TV and a Roku. when you listen to music with the HomePod, the sound is amazing. I’m working on getting better speakers for my AVR. The set up I have right now sounds great when you’re watching a movie. Not so much for music alone. Saving up for better quality speakers. The only con I have to say is the electrical cord is a little short. You can’t place it far from a wall without an extension cord. The best thing I like is it doesn’t try to sell you anything. Oh yeah, the bass from this little cylinder HomePod surprised me. Amazing. Siri fun to have. Gotta get used to talking to it so it’s a learning curve. I’m thinking of getting one more to go stereo with it. Maybe at Christmas time."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Terrific Speaker, Meh ""Smartness""","I'm listening to music from my HomePod as I write this. If you're a tech nerd like I am, you'll know what everyone else says: HomePod has terrific internals––you certainly won't be disappointed with its sound quality––but don't expect much from Siri being a ""smart speaker."" A recent survey stated that customers in the Apple ecosystem are more likely to pair their apple-product-oriented lifestyle with Alexa products than Google Home products, which is the same for me. I let the versatility of Alexa handle the truly smart, smart home functions (i.e. Hue bulbs, smart outlets––which are way way way cheaper and reliable than HomeKit outlets, among other smart accessories). Anyway, back to HomePod: crisp, clear highs, well-rounded bass, good midtones make for great 360˚ sound. The touch screen is limited to the same controls one would get from the included EarPods with any iPhone––they just look more aesthetic. Other details: it's heavy for its small size, you NEED an Apple Music subscription to take advantage of full Siri voice controls, other sounds (music, youtube, whatever) can still be streamed to HomePod via Airplay (and Airplay 2 when it comes out), it works ONLY with apple devices since there is no bluetooth (I know right).Less"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Best Smart Speaker I've Tried,"I wasn't sure if i'd enjoy this when I first got it but it was on sale so I figured why not. I love setting reminders and alarms with siri. This thing wakes me up so well in the morning. The sound truly is quite robust, especially for the type of music I like to listen to. It handles hip hop, rock, and pop quite well. I only have a couple of cons. I wish that it would go louder. The volume can only be increased so far and would only be able to fill a bedroom. It would not be capable of supporting my sort of large living room which has a very high vaulted ceiling. One issue I found is that since I own quite a few apple devices, triggering the speaker with ""hey siri"" activates all of the assistants on my devices at once. It would be great if apple let us change the phrase to something else. When I tell her to play music on my homepod sometimes my ipads and iphone will try to play music as well. I've tried the alexa dot, the google home hub, as well as the google home mini and the homepod is definitely the best smart speaker I've interacted with. If Apple makes mini versions to place around my home I'll definitely be buying them.Less"
4.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Super easy setup and great sound for its size,"Setup couldnt be easier. Just hold your iPhone close, power the HomePod up and go through a few simple setup options and you are all set. The sound is impressive considering the size of the speaker. Id like a bit more base but that isnt physically possible. Deep base requires a large speaker. There is just no getting around it. I waited a couple of weeks before rating the HomePod. It was fun asking it a variety of questions and changing the voices country, etc. and it is well integrated into the iHome ecosystem but Id still like to see a bit more. Ive had a good stereo system connected to my tv since the early 1990s when I had a Laserdisk player. Now I have a modern stereo connected to my main tv. While I dont have a sound bar under the tv, I have a pair of upper mid range speakers on either side and their 6-1/2 woofers can push out lower bass. A dedicated subwoofer would shake the floor. The HomePod is great. I use it in my bedroom and is ideal there. I can ask it questions, set alarms, play music, use it as the sound output from my AppleTV and the sound is far better than what I get from the TVs built-in speakers. I find it mind blowing that HomePod can clearly hear my questions even while it is playing music. That said, what I would like to see is the following: 1. The ability to add a subwoofer output maybe partner with a third party on this for a powered subwoofer and maybe a sounder? With two HomePods and a powered base, you have a nice home theater. Add in a sound bar under the tv and you have the potential for a great home theater that is smart too. 2. The ability to tune in to internet radio stations but I doubt we will ever see that. One of my favorite stations is the old bluegrass station on Heartland Public Radio. However, this competes with Apple Music so I doubt it will ever happen. That said, it is available on Apple TV as an app so I can get it that way. Bottom line - Im happy and may buy a second one for stereo in my bedroom.Less"
4.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Looks Great / Sounds Very Good / Frustrating to Use,"It looks great - not a fan of the lighter colored one, but the Space Gray is really nice and fits into the home well. The sound is excellent - it's much better than the Sonos Play 1, but not as good as the Sonos Play 5 - and all that seems fair considering the price is right in the middle of those 2 speakers. Even with AirPlay 2 update, it's a frustrating experience at times. Frustrations include: - if you talk to Siri, the music is streamed from the speaker, which is great. But if you just AirPlay music from your phone to the speakers, it's streamed from the phone, rather than the speakers making the smart choice to take over streaming. So there's a dead WiFi spot in my kitchen, and if my phone ends up there then the music stops playing. That's silly. - with Sonos, I was used to just hitting ""Play"" when I walked past a speaker and it would pick up immediately from wherever I left off. HomePod doesn't do that, it picks up from wherever the God Of Apple Music tells it to pick up from. - I have 3 HomePods, and there's no way to get music to stream to all of them with one touch on the phone - I have to select each speaker individually, every single time. It's annoying. I think/hope it'll get better with software updates, but that's how I've felt about iOS notifications for the past 8 years too. Fingers crossed!Less"
1.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Only useful as a bluetooth speaker,"Siri integration is not that great. Plenty of times it tells me there is an error. Even though I have Apple Music set up, siri likes to ignore my requests and play whatever it feels like. Sound is heavy in bass, which some may not like. Voice call quality is so-so -- the receiving end tells me that the quality is worse than using iphone speaker. Overall, I use it in the kitchen as a speaker only, to airplay my iphone music. You can get better bluetooth speakers for the same price, so I'm not sure what Apple intended with the HomePod. I certainly should have returned it... too bad I threw out the packaging."
4.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Awesome sound + Bass,"Love this Speaker! At the current price on sale, i couldn’t help myself and I decided to add a second one for Stereo Pair. Just one sounds amazing, but two is phenomenal. I purchased my first one 10/20/19 and the second one 11/7/19. Don’t really care how it’s mainly optimized for Apple Music. I use Spotify, and it would be nice to use Siri to play music... instead of having to airplay from my phone. The smart features aren’t has good as Alexa, but at least theres something. I mainly use Siri for controlling my lights. Overall i do love these speakers. I highly recommend if you want to stay within the Apple ecosystem."
4.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,"If you're in the Ecosystem, it may be worth it","The HomePod isnt for everyone. Siri isn't a great assistant, there's no bluetooth support (only AirPlay). So this device is more for someone who is already in the Apple Ecosystem and want a decent sounding smart speaker. The sound quality is great. Paring with another HomePod is fantastic. It also serves as a Hub for all of your HomeKit devices, thus allowing you to control things remotely. The assistant features are just okay. Standard at best. But upcoming software updates may make it more appealing."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,This bad boy is..... BAD!,"I recently picked this up after selling my previous HomePod for a few reasons: 1. Mobility was a challenge because of its weight (took to and from work). 2. The power cord is static and is not removable 3. No Bluetooth connectivity I went out and bought a Bose SoundLink Revolve + after I sold my HomePod. Immediately I noticed the biggest difference- the sound! Oh, how I missed the sound! Don’t get me wrong as the Bose did sound good and it did have the functions I was missing in the HomePod (to include a couple other ones I liked that the HomePod didn’t have), but that awesome sound the HomePod put out was not there and I missed it! The HomePod has this robust and deep sound quality that just filled the room like no other speaker I’ve owned (in this classification). My colleagues at work were amazed by the HomePod and when I showed up with the Bose they weren’t completely dissatisfied (it sounded better than the UE, Sony, and Beats mobile speakers others have), but they truly marveled at the glorious playback of the HomePod.... and so did I! Well, fixed that dilemma and went back to Best Buy and got another one! This time I got it in white and it was on sale for $299!!! Score! With the updates it can do more now making Siri more functional and also making the HomePod pair for stereo sound. I’ll not make this mistake ever again!Less"
4.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Really enjoy mine,"HomePod, first and foremost, it's an excellent speaker. You can place it in any room in your home and it will fill it with excellent sound. Siri is, well, Siri and it gets the job done, but honestly Google Assistant and Alexa are more capable digital assistants. I expect it to get more capable with time like the Apple TV did, especially since the processor on the inside of the HomePod is pretty much overkill for what it does. Airplay 2 is excellent and its easy + fast to redirect audio around your home. Overall, if you live in the Apple ecosystem and use stuff like HomeKit its a great add-on. I like mine and will probably be buying another one in a few months."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Great product, better than expected","Sound is excellent and works great with AirPlay 2. Since we are all on Apple iDevices/Mac, connectivity is not even a concern. You can AirPlay using Spotify if you like, but I've decided to give Apple Music a try instead being a non-Facebook connected music platform. Having the HomePods have helped me to better understand the Apple Music implementation, which is not nearly as easy to operate as Spotify or Pandora at first. I now like Apple's music implementation better as I use it more. I would recommend that you buy two HomePods at a time since you may want to use a twin stereo setup in the future. I have them in separate rooms which cover the first floor quite nicely. They are easy to move around with Apple Home App. Also, the HomePods can act as an Apple Home Automation hub if you don't want to use an AppleTV or iPad. All in all, we are glad we bought them on sale at Best Buy, appreciate the quality and will be listening to music much more (and less TV).Less"
3.0,3 weeks ago,Best Buy,Buy only if you’re on the apple ecosystem,Bought this HomePod for Black Friday. Set up was very simple. Sound quality is okay nothing special. I have all the current updates on the unit and still can’t access any streaming apps other than Apple Music witch I’m not subscribe to. There’s no Bluetooth so android users should avoid buying. I have a iPhone and the only way to stream my music apps is through the apple home kit app. I honestly regret buying it but I’ll keep it for now hopefully apple will update with ability to stream the other music streaming apps.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Impressive,"This speaker sounds amazing. I have a full Sonos 5.1 (Playbar, subwoofer, and two Sonos 1's) setup in my living room. Last night, I brought the HomePod into the living room to do a side by side test. While the $350 HomePod is not as good as the $1800 Sonos surround system, it really held its own. Unsurprisingly, the Sonos offers more separation of sounds. There's over a dozen combined tweeters and woofers in the setup, physically located throughout the room. In spite of the HomePod's distinct disadvantage, it still sounded good in comparison. I was expecting it's sound like a transistor radio next to the Sonos system, but it didn't. There's a $1400 difference between these systems, but the sound difference doesn't sound like a $1400 difference. It sounds like maybe a couple hundred dollar difference. The great thing about this speaker is how it can get loud without sounding like it's getting loud. The tones stay clean and undistorted. Thought it's one speaker, it distributes the sound throughout the room. If you were blindfolded, you could certainly tell the sound is coming from one point, but that's always the case unless you have a surround system. I've also owned the Google Home Max. I liked that I could get a family plan for Google Play Music and not really pay any more per month because we're also Youtube Red subscribers. One less subscription in my life is a good thing. However, the Max almost never worked as advertised. I was constantly on the phone with support, who did a valiant job trying to fix my problems (the speakers would no longer take casts from my phone, music uploaded to the Google servers would not play via voice commands, and multiroom was intermittent). On the sound front, the Google Home Max sounded great playing anything with lots of bass. If you're into dance music, rap, RnB, etc., and don't mind the bugs I've listed above, then maybe the Max is for you. My main complaint with the Home Max sound was that it sounded loud, even if it wasn't turned up all the way. I'm tempted to say it overplayed the mids, but I'm not a true audiophile. Maybe that's why I didn't think it sounded that great playing rock/metal/jazz. I've found the HomePod matches the Max in those categories of music, while soundly bettering the Max in playing rock, classical, and jazz. People make much of the Max's bass, but I think the HomePod delivers a better bass with less distortion, especially at loud volume. Now, there's Siri. She's a mess at most things. However, when it comes to getting music to play on the HomePod, she's quite good. Google Home and Alexa might know more, but Siri is better than both of them when it comes to responsiveness for playing music. When I had the Home Max, I'd have to yell at it in the morning to turn off my alarm (I also had white noise playing in the room as it helps me sleep). You have to speak about as loudly with the Home Max as the music it's playing. With the HomePod, I can whisper for her turn off my alarm and she gets it. Would I ask her for directions, or who's playing in the game tonight? Or add an event to my calendar? Or set multiple timers? No. I wouldn't. She's not that smart. But, asking her to play a song from my music library or shut off an alarm? Absolutely. Much has been made of the fact that HomePod doesn't ""support"" Spotify. However, that's only true in the sense that you can't voice command Siri to play your Spotify playlist. You can play media from any app that supports Airplay. That includes Spotify, Audible, podcast apps, and even Google Play Music. Much has been made of the fact that HomePod doesn't support Bluetooth, to which I say, good! Bluetooth is a horrible technology, and anyone who's struggled to get their phone to play nice with the Bluetooth setup in their car knows exactly what I'm talking about. Airplay is a much superior technology and Bluetooth should go away. I'm giving 5 stars because I'm completely satisfied with my purchase and plan on getting more of them in the future (I have two right now). It's not a perfect speaker, but it does what I want it to do without hassle and it does it well. Pros: - World class sound for a small speaker. - Attractive design. - Easy setup. - Works as advertised without constant calls to customer support. - The speaker has great ears and can hear you whisper commands. - Executes music related commands extremely well. - Doesn't support Bluetooth but executes via Airplay flawlessly. Cons: - No multiroom yet. (Apple has promised it in Airplay 2) - No multi HomePod stereo. (Again, promised in Airplay 2) - Siri is a poor excuse for a personal assistant. It can't make calendar events or multiple timers."

4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Great speaker, but a bit pricey...","Bought during a Black Friday deal, which knocked about 100 quid off the price, making this a very good deal. Sounds better than what you'd expect when you see and handle it. Plenty loud, but not to the point of being potentially too loud. Very clear with good highs, mid and lows for a speaker it's size. Might have a hard time filling the space of a huge open room, but would be fine in most homes. Siri is hit or miss, but mostly good with basic commands (changing volume, skipping/replaying/pausing songs, etc.) and not so great when it comes to asking it to play songs by title or artist using an Apple Music subscription (often plays something very different than what I asked for). For the price I paid, I'm very happy but at normal retail price I think it's a little high for what you get, but such is Apple. If you can get it discounted or don't mind the price, it's a great product perfect for use in a fitness room, home office, bedroom or even a decent size family room or kitchen. I do wish it had a built-in battery so that it'd be easier to move from room-to-room.Less"

Although the product will connect via airplay with services like BBC TV it will not connect with any SKY channels via iPad / Mac / iPhone, this is REALLY annoying!

Sadly there are not wired inputs but it is the 21st Century after all. Who needs wires? I recommend Apple’s HomePod to anyone who enjoys music and wants quality playback. Well worth the money."
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Easily the best audio bang for buck available.,"Apple have done the seemingly impossible with the HomePod: They removed the room from the sound quality equation. The sound quality most reminds me of planar magnetic headphones. The clarity and separation are spectacular, and I have yet to miss the powered subwoofer that was paired to the speakers my HomePods replaced. If you already have a dedicated listening room with all the room treatments necessary to optimize sound quality from your current high-quality speakers, the HomePod is probably not for you. However, if you are the type of person who has better things to do with their money than to drop $5K-10K on room treatments, you'll be hard pressed to find similar sound quality for anywhere near the price of the HomePod. It's worth pointing out that the HomePod isn't a smart speaker in the sense that Amazon Echo or Google Home are smart speakers. The HomePod is designed to make your audio sound great, not to give you directions and traffic conditions for your weekly grocery trek. If audio quality isn't a high priority, the HomePod probably isn't for you.Less"
4.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,"Fun and even better in stereo, wish they had a sub","Just got a second one of these to add to my first to improve the sound stage in stereo. Great bass as a standalone unit, but it would be nice if they offered a subwoofer option. I enjoy rocking out to this, but for parties it would be great to have that little extra oomf of a low range driver with more extension. Mod ads is great and room filling sound. Hope you the best of luck if you decide to go this route. Pretty much requires Apple Music which is not as good at my amazon echo setup which has stereo and line output from my echo dot set up as a group lets me use my $800 KEF subwoofer for bass AND THE COMBO is awesome! For less than $250 I have echo stereo pair and the subwoofer adapter."
1.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,"Good sound quality, horrible function.","When the speaker does what it is supposed to the sound is great, but unfortunately takes a while to get anything playing from your phone. It tires to open a new hub so you can control the HomePod volume and still control your phone volume but it usually can’t keep playing more than 1 song without crashing if not stopping in the middle of the song. And the hub will give you a loading screen and Apple Music will also give you a loading screen and you can’t really do anything while it tried to connect. I’m able to listen to music about 40% of the time when I use this speaker. It just tried to do too much without having the software to back it up so it leads to a lot of headaches and frustrations."
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Disappointing sound quality,"I have a couple of Echo/Alexa devices that I use to control home devices. Since I am deep into the Apple ecosystem, I was interested in getting a HomePod for intergration with my music and for better sound quality. When the price dropped by $100, I bought one. While control of my Wemo devices was faster and smoother with the HomePod, I do not agree with the seemingly vast majority of people who think the sound is great. I was very disappointed that mostly midrange and voice sounds were very muffled almost like the HomePod was wrapped in plastic. I moved the HomePod to other locations in the room with the same result. This was a significant negative for me since I prefer more crisp, clear sound. The base range was more than adequate, almost to the point of being too “boomy.” I am returning this HomePod and hoping the next generation that is rumored to be coming out by mid 2019 will address the sound issues or at least provide the option of manual sound adjustments.Less"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Great sound, Siri & Music Services are limited","First and foremost, I love the sound that comes from my HomePod. I also have an Echo 1, an Echo 2, an Echo Show, an Echo Dot and two Sonos Play:1 speakers. The HomePod sounds much better than any of the Echo Devices. The HomePod has very solid bass and very clear highs. Midrange is a little lacking though. The Echos sound flat and a little muddy in comparison. Compared to the Play:1, The HomePod has slightly stronger bass and slightly clearer highs. Where the Play:1 has an advantage is midrange. The sound from the Sonos is a little fuller overall but also a slightly muddier. The thing I like most about the Echo devices is their ability to play so many stations with voice commands. iHeartRadio and Radio.com are 2 of my favorite providers. I can play them on the HomePod but only thru my iPhone or iPad. I cannot ask for them with my voice. If I could, I would use the HomePod much more often. I can only use Apple Music with the HomePod using my voice. This is great if I know exactly the song and artist I'm looking for. However, the Apple Music playlists are not as good as the stations on iHeartRadio and I can't ask for local sports radio. I can only get ESPN radio using Siri. So far, my Play:1 speakers only work thru the Sonos app for me. I should be able to send music to them with an Echo but there is some sort of conflict on my network preventing them from working properly. If I can get this straightened out, I will stream more often to them. Overall I would recommend the HomePod to people that use the Apple ecosystem. Especially if you love Apple Music. Right now, I'm setting up my own apple Music Playlists. Once I do that, I will likely use the HomePod more. If I could use my HomePod like my Echo devices, I would give it 5 stars all day. But because Siri is so lacking in smarts, I deducted a star. Others might deduct more but I do love the sound...Less"

3.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Expensive,"Having investigated most of these 'talking' gizmos I plumped for the HomePod mainly because I was assured (by John Lewis) that it could be linked to my iTunes library (which is considerable). However when I finally got the HomePod linked to iTunes on my Mac I realised that yes, I could play my iTunes library through the HomePod, but the HomePod cannot take verbal instructions re playing particular tracks, artists etc. The best it can do is move on to the next track on command, from a playlist. The same applies to any music on one's iPhone if connected to the HomePod (via Bluetooth). The only way to get music on command is to sign up to Apple's streaming service (at £9.99 per month) or have you iTunes library in iCloud (again an expensive option). As I have some 20,000 tracks in my iTunes library I consider this a bit of a con. Apple could clearly make one's iTunes library available for voice command as I can play my iPhone iTunes library through my HiFi system & do just that. Buyers should also note that radio stations available are limited. However the sound is excellent.Less"

1.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Does not work as stereo,"We had purchased a pair of HomePod speakers for our new kitchen to (hopefully) replace our old in-ceiling speakers with a more modern option. It was stated on Apple's website that if used in pair, the speakers automatically work in stereo mode. It wasn't until we actually tried to get this functionality to work that we realized this feature won't be available until late 2019. I just don't see how a speaker designed primarily for its sound quality can advertise itself as stereo without actually supporting that feature. Aside from the above, the speakers failed to connect after an hour of use. We had to continuously unplug the power cord and restart our phone (running the latest iOS). Half the time, trying to play music through Apple Music, we'd just see a spinning ""loader"" bar as it tried to connect. We spent two hours trying to troubleshoot the issue, but frankly, gave up. We wanted a seamless, reliable audio solution, not something that we'd need to constantly update and restart. It's really unfortunate, because when they did work (in Mono mode), they sounded quite well. They're going back to the store the same day.Less"

Really, if you are judging this by whether or not it can tell you a riddle each day or to turn on your light, then you probably don't need this. But if you are looking for great audio quality, ease of use, and room-filling sound, there is absolutely no comparison. If you subscribe to Apple Music, this is a must-have accessory. Even if you don't, it easily plays any music streaming service through Airplay (you just can't use the voice feature to select songs, so you have to use your phone--but how is that any different than bluetooth interactivity?) I have both the Sonos 3 and a HomePod, and the HomePod sounds much better. I like it better because it doesn't sound like the music is coming from a box and is much better looking--it doesn't look like a boxy speaker sitting on a shelf.

I know speakers can sound a lot different once you get them set up in your house. I took them home, powered them up, went through the setup options and paired them as a stereo pair. The sound really good. I did a sound comparison between the HomePods and my Bose Soundtouch 30's. The sound is pretty equal. I'm selling off my Bose. The setup up procedure is pretty simple. I also have an Apple TV. I can stream sound from the Apple Tv to my HomePods."
5.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Couldn't be more happier with my purchase!,"OK so here is my story: I have Bose Solo 15 Series II soundbar for my TV and playing music over bluetooth needs, which has a very awesome sound and Bass. Now before purchasing Apple HomePod I told my wife that Bose would blow this thing out of the water and then I may return this but believe me, on it's head to head comparison with Bose Apple HomePod came winner in most of the songs that I played (Bose also did a nice job) but I was so amazed that how speaker like this which is not very big is awesome on sound plus all of it's smart features which Bose does not have it. This is clearly my best black Friday purcahse ever. Also, kudos to Best Buy they delivered this awesome gadget to me next day. Definetly recommend this to any one who is on the fence to buy this."
5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Easy set up. easy to use. Get 2 for stereo,"I play it mostly as low level background but it plays loud also. Seems like it has software loudness correction that is well done. Well controlled. Not boomy. It can articulate the sound of picks on strings and different types of cymbal strikes. Where the drumstick hitting cymbal not just the crash. Obviously sound out depends on source quality. Very reasonable compromise of physical size, sound quality and ease of use. I have spent extended periods of time listening to systems that cost as much as new cars and I enjoy listening to music through the homepods."
2.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Great sound, that's it....","First off...IM A DIE HARD APPLE FAN...This speaker has 2 positive things going for it. 1, it has a beautiful design and is quite modern/sleek. 2, it sounds amazing with all types of music playing through it. BUT THAT IS ALL....in the video on apple's site, they advertise how many microphones it has so it can hear your voice, but I had TONS of difficulty trying to do simple things that I never had issues with my Google Home. Things like Play, Stop, and certain titles and commands get easily confused. It can only play music from Apple's Music service, and it can only be linked via bluetooth to ONE device at a time. Also it must be linked through the apple home application, not just through bluetooth. Meaning non-Apple devices and others just wanting to take control cannot do so easily. Finally the biggest flaw is the price. If you want a nice looking and sounding speaker, that has a less intelligent version of Siri than the one in my phone for $350+....by all means get this speaker. If you are an Alexa or Google Home user, you probably would be disappointed thinking that assistance of Siri could be anywhere near as good as Google Assistant or Alexa.Less"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Excellent product,"My old setup required me to airplay Apple Music to Apple TV which is connected to a nose speaker via audio jack on my tv. That’s 3 appliances right there and can’t even shut the tv screen off to save electricity so I decided to buy this. Just plug it in and the rest is history lol! At first I wasn’t impressed by the bass but eventually liked it when it started playing songs with good bass to begging with. Try search Bass Boosted songs in YouTube to see hear how crazy the bass is with this device. I also like how excellent the mic is even on loud environment. The integration is great with Apple Music and I just like how it knows what songs I like Price is high but worth it. It will eventually get software updates to that’s nice too. TIP for using Siri *don’t say Hey siri then pause unlike the iPhone. Complete the command in one sentence and the HomePod will understand. Hey Siri play chill music! No shouting needed too And additionaly, the speaker is heavy and doesn’t feel cheap. With its weight, you don’t have to worry about accidental knockdown.Less"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Product for Black Friday Sale Price,"I bought the HomePod during the Best Buy Black Friday sale for $250. Great quality of sound on a variety of music, I use it constantly since purchase. I have a large basement room and initially tried placing the HomePod in a corner, but finally settled on a location in the middle of the room, from there it gave great sound where ever you are within the room. This is definitely a first generation product, it lags hooking into iTunes on my MacBook Pro, sometimes taking up to 5 minutes to be recognized. It instantly recognizes my iPhone, but has major problems recognizing my iPad Pro. Setup was extremely easy using my iPhone. I have not tried to hook it up with my Apple TV 4K, but see no reason to because my TV system already has a surround system. I do like the AirPlay 2, no latency between speakers if you have more than one speaker playing when using the HomePod.Less"
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,I’ve rediscovered my love of music,"I’m a musician, so I’ve been around a lot of semi to pro sound equipment in my life. And while pro equipment like decent monitors sounds good, it’s usually an eyesore anywhere outside of the studio. Conversely, consumer orientated speakers usually look decent in a living room, but just sound like tiny boxes creating undefinable music. This is where the HomePod differs. It’s the nexus of the two. It sounds AND looks good. I mean, astoundingly so. Yes, I’m sure you’ve read or watched all the reviewers, but it’s not hyperbole when they praise the sound. Deep resonant bass, but with clarity. Not muffled, most likely due to the unconventional position of the woofer inside. Because of this speaker, and the vast library of Apple Music, I’ve been just exploring more genres and music than before. Quality counts. It’s like buying a good guitar... you just want to play it. Oh sure, a cheap one can get you in the ballpark, but a good one inspires. The speaker is worth the price alone, in my opinion. Now comes the Siri aspect. I know the initial reviews were lukewarm about Siri (it’s since been updated and the responses “smarter”) but personally, I don’t have a problem with it. I don’t ask my speaker for the meaning of life. I want weather, time, and the occasional bit of other information. I use the HomePod For what it’s made, a music device. Some would say the price is a bit high. I would agree on this point, so that’s why I waited until BH had a sale and I purchased for $100 off. That said, given that I’ve now heard it and used the thing for several weeks, I can say that it’s a decent deal at any sale price, so don’t hesitate should it be discounted again. I treated myself this Christmas and also purchased the Apple TV. Given the choice, I find the HomePod much more a value. It’s almost always on now and let me tell you, it can hear your commands from a long ways off. Almost eerily so. The noisy stores don’t do this speaker justice. You just need to hear it in your home. While it may not bring down the roof in some house party, it’s more than adequate for normal listening in a home setting. I’m glad I took the chance on it.Less"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Sounds great,"This speaker sounds really good. I don't use a ton of the home automation features, but I can fill a relatively large set of rooms with decent sound using only one device. I also have a Sonos One in another room, and this does sound much fuller. I'll admit, I don't use any of the home automation features. I mostly play music using AirPlay2 from my iPhone. Hoping to add an Airport Express or AppleTV so I can push AirPlay2 audio to my tv/surround sound system at the same time for parties. Much cheaper than trying to retrofit my house for in ceiling speakers etc."
2.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Unbalanced sound - Not white,"There are a lot of reviews out there so I will focus on the one thing I liked and the three things that made me return the Homepod. The one thing I like about the Homepod is that it can really fill a room. And unlike my Sonos, the music sounds the same almost anywhere in the room. With the Sonos, it's best to stand in from of the speaker. Unfortunately, this is the only pro of the Homepod for me. I purchased the Homepod to see if the sound was as good as people say. The sound quality is good but I hate the balance. WAY TOO MUCH BASS!! It's all bass, a little bit of highs and very little mediums. A lot of people like a lot of bass but this is ridiculous. Lows travel well through walls so it quickly becomes annoying for other people in the house and/or neighbors. As a result you're force to listen at very low volume. My second issue is the lack of access to other music services. I knew it going in but it's more annoying than I expected. You can use Airplay but it is laggy and what's the point of paying $350 for a speaker if you cannot use voice control. The last thing that bothered me is the color. The speaker is not really white. The mesh fabric is but the plastic cylinder under is black which make the Homepod look greyish. Overall a big $350 disappointment.Less"
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Powerful Sounds - Small Package,"Leave it to Apple to combine the best of their tech and Beats technology. I especially like how seamless it is with all my Apple tech I already own. The speaker is powerful but compact. The 7 mics find it easy to hear me speaking to Siri, even when volume is turned up. And it's great to connect 2 speakers for a more immersive surround sound experience. The only downside I can find is that the speaker is hard-wired to a power source, so it's not portable - in that it doesn't have it's own battery supply. That's not an issue for me, but it could be for others."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great speaker,"If you are an Apple person then this speaker is for you. I took a gamble as I have the Bose SoundTouch speakers throughout the house. Bose announced that they will be supporting airplay 2 in 2019 and I wanted this to be a speaker to include in my whole house system. Even if Bose does not end up supporting airplay 2, I will keep this speaker. It integrates with Siri well and even after a couple days of use, I have found myself using it more than I thought. I currently have it in my kitchen. You can ask it (Siri) about sports, news, and weather, and will give you updates from ESPN, a variety of other news outlets, and weather from the Weather channel. It has great bass for the size of the speaker and it sounds great overall. I have not tried to connect via Bluetooth yet. Set up was simple, especially with an iPhone. You literally hold your phone next to the speaker and you are basically done. Works great with Apple Music.Less"
5.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Awesome sound,"Wow! The bass and volume from this device is amazing. Controls my Home integrated devices and maintains a consistent connection (even after a power outage). I have Apple Music and this device has become the DJ that takes requests. I now have purchased 2 of these to cover any command given throughout my house. While Siri could be a little better, I have found this device to be light years ahead of its response to the ""hey Siri"" commands. Even when the music is at full volume. Alexa just cannot replicate this."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Sound Quality is Absolutely Amazing!,"I can't believe the sound quality of the HomePod. I was expecting it to be good and being sort of an audiophile I figured with it only being one speaker that it would be good but nothing that great. Boy was I wrong, it's AMAZING the kind of sound this little guy can pump out. And the quality and fullness of the sound is nothing short of extraordinary. It may not be the smartest speaker in the world, but the sound quality is what this thing was meant for and in that regard it blows away the competition. And to be fair it's good on the smart side of things too."
5.0,a year ago,very.co.uk,"If you are an iOS user, there’s nothing better","I thought it was worth trying a HomePod, much to my wife’s annoyance (I am an Apple gadget addict). Within an hour she was convinced, sound wise it’s phenomenal for the size and fills the house with music. Apple Music is easier to manage if you have a young family than Spotify, and if you have a family who is invested in iOS the HomePod is definitely worth considering. Downsides - the software is still half baked, while Siri is excellent at hearing you over loud music, far better than an Amazon Echo generation, Siri can trip up a lot, and isn’t as full featured. Software however is easily fixed, which when the hardware sounds this good its less of an issue than great software but rubbish sound. Home Automation is limited with HomePod to devices which are only HomeKit enabled, but we have found that responsive with HomeKit is quicker. Siri is more secure than Competitirs, and whose microphones would you rather have in your house, a company who is only interested in selling nice stuff to you and anonymises data (Apple) or companies who want to know everything about you and your habits. The HomePod is more expensive but you get what you pay for, and we love it.Less"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Great Sound, Shaky Software","HomePod speakers are a little different than your typical wireless speakers. They use WiFi, not Bluetooth for transmitting sound. While WiFi has the bandwidth needed to transmit all of the music, I wish that using Bluetooth was an option. I bought a pair of HomePods as I wanted full stereo sound. In this case, two HomePods are at least three times better than a single one. In my opinion, I've never heard speakers of this size that have such deep, full bass. The problem is Apple's software support for HomePods with AirPlay. They work well with iTunes and independently using Siri, but no other Mac software supports HomePod as a stereo pair. That means that no Safari-based music can use them. When Apple updates Mac OS to work with stereo HomePods, I would probably give the product five stars.Less"
5.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,"Surprising sound for size, better after updates","I own 3 Homepods now and plan to pick up a few more to scatter around the house. With the latest updates to AppleTV, I use the Homepod so much more. I'll put on a movie while doing housework, and Airplay the audio from the movie to all the Homepods in the house. I do the same thing with music from my iPhone. I do have 1 Sonos Beam also included in the mix, but the Homepod sounds better than the Beam (it sounds shallow/like it's in a box) My only complaint is having so many smart home devices, streaming, and other wifi things, I can overload my WiFi/router. Need to upgrade that next."
2.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Great Sound, deeply flawed","When I received my Homepod, I was very excited to open it and give it a try. Set up was super easy, so that's good. The sound is great and SIRI is general quick to respond to ""hey siri"" commands. However, as others have noted, you can't use Hey Siri to play your music or audio from other apps. You need your iphone/ipad to play music from services such as Amazon Music or Spotify via AirPlay on your Homepod. Tha'ts a bummer and at least a 1 star reduction in my book. Big Flaw: Sometime the Homepod will get into a state were ""Hey Sir"" will acknowledge a request to play an album or playlist, but NOT play the music you requested. For instance, I recently asked ""Hey Siri"" to ""play Pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon"" She acknowledged with ""ok playing Pink Floyd the Dark Side of the Moon"". But then silence. I tried the request multiple times, same result, silence This happens quite often with other artists/albums too. I Googled the issue, and many others are running into the same issue. The only solution appears to be resetting your Homepod. I tried this a few times, and the fix does work. But seriously annoying that I have to do it about every other day. This is not the quality I have come to expect from Apple.Less"
5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,"Great product, Sounds awesome, looks brand new. Best sounding smart speaker I have.","HomePod was in good shape. Opening the package I noticed a corner of the HomePod packaging was damaged (slightly). Thankfully the product was fine at first inspection. The box wasnt in the original plastic wrap (as it is used). It came in the original box and had the instructions pack without the Apple sticker. Plugging it in I didnt get the welcome message from Siri. The first thing it said was it cant connect to the internet. It also wouldnt connect to my phone (like it should out of the box). I had to factory reset the HomePod to connect to it. After finally connecting to it (and updating it) I got to hear this HomePod for the first time. I do have another HomePod that I purchase new and compared it to it. I must say It sounded just as great as the other one that I bought new. My only complaints would be is that it wasnt factory reset as the description indicated. Being tech savvy it wasnt that huge a deal and was easy to reset. Overall Im very happy this purchase, its sounds good and works as it was intended. I would definitely by this product again!Less"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Pretty Awesome,"One of the things that frustrates me about customer reviews is that they complain about what something DOESN'T have and not what it does. The HomePod was just released. The focus was on the hardware side of things (Hence all the positive comments about how amazing the sound quality is) In terms of the software related side. Be patient... Its Apple! It's going to get better. It was a smart move on their part to focus on the physical aspect of the device rather than releasing bigger, better versions. Get the hardware right, and then focus on the software and provide updates to improve the overall experience. My personal review. I was pretty skeptical about the sound and was surprisingly shocked when I ended up returning my Bose Soundtouch 20 and replacing it with the HomePod. I plan on purchasing a second one and setting it up stereo and testing it out by watching a movie. The overall feel and look of the speaker is pretty awesome. It's heavy, the mesh surrounding feels very well put together. The setup is easy, Siri is fine for what I need. She will improve over time though. Otherwise I'm totally happy with this purchase.Less"

Siri is,,,,,,well typical Siri, misses a lot of requests no matter how clear or precise I speak. Speaker is way overpriced, and personally could not see buying another Homepod just to create stereo, the cost would be insane. Everyone is not the same, what I may not like, someone else is excited over.,,,,,,With all the positive reviews, I tried it myself, and soon realized this is one time the reviews just missed it. I have to wonder, with all the positive reviews and carrying on about how great this speaker sounds, it really makes me wonder what were these people listening to before they purchased the Homepod,,,,hmmmm maybe a transistor radio or a one piece ear plug. Don't take my word for it, try it yourself.Less"
5.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Incredible Sound Quality,"I pondered quite a while on the purchase of the HomePod. It just didn't seem to be as usable as other options. I have to admit I love my Sonos speakers. The setup a HomePod is incredibly easy which was not surprise it being Apple. The sound quality exceeds the Sonos, which should also be expected as it is a bit more pricey than the Sonos. If you are not an Apple Music subscriber, I would definitely look at other options. I'm not sure what I am going to do after the three month Apple Music trial. If you are an Apple product user, this is an excellent addition to the family."

I use Alexa for info and bought these mainly for the speaker and it’s perfect integration with ITunes. The speakers sound great and can work as a multi room or stereo system. I love being able to tell Siri to play my favorite playlist so I hear exactly what I want to hear. It’s also fun to pit Siri against Alexa occasionally though I think Alexa May have the better personality"
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Great speaker for certain purpose,I currently have a single HomePod. I love the integration with Apple Music. The handoff feature is amazing. Listening to something on your phone. Hold it over the HomePod and viola. I wish it had a little more power. It sounds great but it’s not going to outperform a set of decent bookshelf speakers. For general listenIng it’s great. I plan on getting at least one more. A stereo pair may have that extra volume I’m looking for. Having them in multiple rooms would help to for easier listening I.

5.0,2 years ago,John Lewis,This is a great product if you are already brought into the Apple Ecosystem.,"This is a great product if you are already brought into the Apple Ecosystem. Rival products are NOT the Amazon Echo or Google Home as the sound is far superior to those devices. A comparable device would be the (more expensive) Google Home Max. Pros: - The sound. It really sounds great for a device its size. Do not even bother trying to compare with the Echo. Slight downside for me personally is that it's perhaps a tad too bass heavy. - It is a doddle to set up. Just hold your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad next to the HomePod and off you go. - The Siri/Homekit integration is great. There is a lot less latency turning (for example) your Hue lights on/off via the HomePod compared to the Echo. First world problems and all that. - You can Airplay from your Apple Devices to the HomePod and IMHO that works far better than bluetooth. - The microphones. They easily hear you over loud music, and I would say far better than an Echo does. Cons: - Siri is not as good as Alexa or Google Home. Though to be honest it's perfectly adequate for the sorts of things you are likely to want to do on a daily basis. There are a few annoying omissions, but hopefully these will improve in time. - Less skills/third party integration than Alexa. You are restricted to Homekit stuff, but then that works really well. - If you are an Android user then don't bother. Personally I've not compared the HomePod's sound to a Sonos (there are plenty of reviews on YouTube). I would definitely recommended this if you are an Apple User, and you are happy living in the Apple walled garden. Otherwise...not so much.Less"

Check The HomePod is designed to be a high quality speaker, and in typical apple fashion, it delivers. The sound quality is AMAZING. I'm truly impressed at the sound quality at lower volumes, especially the bass. The sound is crystal clear and, personally, only disappoints in the higher range frequencies at near full volume (which I only tried just for the sake of finding out, this thing is LOUD) I also use the Siri integration on a daily basis to do things like: Check the weather Toggle lights Control security system Have Siri she cant do something Ive asked on the Homepod.

5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great sound and functions in a small package,"We loved our first HomePod and when they went on sale, we couldn't wait to set up our Homepods in stereo. They actually are so precise it is a surround sound in our house that has plenty of volume, decent bass that was unexpected and with Apple Music, we can play anything we wish at any time. They are also a wonderful control for the house with a bonus of being the pest phone speaker I have ever used. They pick up your voice clearly anywhere in the house for hands free and group conversations. I plan on picking up another one for the office to use for both music and for our conference calls."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great for casual listening,"I bought a pair of these to try in a stereo setup. Syncing them with my phone was as smooth as expected. They worked wonderfully with Apple Music. Very impressed with Siri voice command; in particular their ability to hear commands even when speaking quietly while they are playing at high volumes. The sound was much better than I’d hoped- decent highs and a surprising amount of low end for their size. I came very close to keeping them. Ultimately they went back because I was looking for a pair of speakers that would elevate the music a bit more for critical listening. For the casual listener who has an Apple Music subscription, however, they are hard to beat in terms of simplicity, access to music, and yes, the sound as well. I’d be happy to have one (or two) down the road for a second or third audio zone.Less"
1.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,After a year 3 are now bricks,Here is my issue with HomePod's. I have three of them and love the sound. The problem is I have not been able to stream to them for weeks. Apple broke their Keychain software with IOS 13 for many people. Without a working Keychain the HomePods can not be streamed to. Maybe if Apple would open up the bluetooth that is sitting if these bricks I could at least stream to one till a fix comes out. I have been part of the Apple for over 15 years but with the HomePods Apple has locked them down so much that they are useless. I will be looking to sell these and get new system that uses both WIFI and bluetooth.

I can access my local NPR news station, check the weather, time, and it syncs perfectly with my iPhone and iPad.

2.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Do not buy this untill later.,Please do not buy this until later on in the year. This speaker can not do much as of right now and has 0 voice recognition and this isn't good because anybody can ask what your last text message was and it will read it out loud without a problem and they can mess with your phone basically. Don't get me wrong this speaker has flawless sound and has barely any distortion at max volume. But if you ask it to play a certain playlist on something like Spotify or Pandora. It will only allow you to use apple music and nothing else. Please take my word and wait until later on this year when they are updating this speaker to do more commands. if you want a good smart speaker get Google Home or Amazon Alexa. They both can do 10x more than what the apple homepod is able to do right now. and it's a lot less expensive than this (only because it's apple and they overprice everything.) If you are just in general looking for a good sounding speaker look at Bose Sony or UE. They all have good sound quality and if you hold a certain button they can summon Siri or Google.Less
4.0,3 weeks ago,John Lewis,Great for Apple Music and not much else,"If you have an iPhone and an Apple Music subscription, and you’re fed up with the tinny sound of an Amazon Echo device, but you don’t want to invest in Sonos, then this is the device you need. Great sound with Siri voice control. But... no internet radio. You can ask Siri about the weather and she’ll also do internet searches. You can ask for a wake up alarm but I like waking up to the radio, and you can’t. Home pod also acts as a hub for Apple Home Kit home automation, although in my opinion, Apple lags Amazon in this area. I haven’t used this aspect."

It sounds great, looks great, and is handy for controlling my Homekit-enabled products by voice. However, I find myself wishing it would do more. I am still learning its quirks, such as how it manages default reminder lists, etc. Also, I have to ask everyone in the room not to talk and mute the TV before I attempt to speak to it, because it can't seem to separate out that type of background noise. I have to say that I would not pay the current MSRP for this...I just don't think it is worth it. I hope that Apple makes substantial improvements in Siri's AI very soon, which would improve the overall experience. One last note...I can't make phonecalls from HomePod because I use wifi-calling (it appears to be a known issue). That is just another minor disappointment that I hope gets fixed soon.Less"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great music player – but so much more...,"The HomePod was pricey at $350, but is a great bargain at $250. I bought it because the sound is awesome–lightyears ahead of other smart speakers. It streams Apple Music, web radio, and even your local stations. It has a reputation for not being as ""smart"" as Alexa or others, but that changing. And they are great integrated features that I didn't realize, like making speaker phone calls. The setup couldn't be easier. If you have an iPhone or iPad, you put them close, confirm you want to set up HomePod, and that's it!. It automatically configures it for your network settings, Apple ID, iTunes subscriptions, everything. And, if you're looking to add other smart-home devices, it can serve as your base station to connect and control your lights, doorbells, temp settings, whatever. I definitely got more than I bargained for.Less"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Fantastic Device,"I’ll begin by saying that I’ve been a subscriber of Apple Music for the past few years, and that made the Home Pod especially attractive to me. The sound quality is great, the design is beautiful, and overall it has been a very capable device. We have an older surround sound system connected to the TV (with an Apple TV), and that used to be our main source for listening to music. But asking Siri to play whatever we’re in the mood for is much more convenient! So far the unit has been flawless in serving as the “home hub” for our smart devices. It’s fun to control lighting and home accessories simply by asking Siri! Response to commands is rapid, accurate, and has exceeded my expectations. Yes, home pod is priced higher than some of its competitors, but it certainly has the look and feel of a premium device. If you are already a fan of the Apple eco system, and/or a subscriber of Apple Music, I can’t recommend it enough.Less"

I know Apple updated the speaker for Airplay 2 and that does work but no where near as well as our Sonos speakers. The ease of use is something I think the speaker is lacking and it would be nice if there were voice controls available for services other than Apple Music. Amazon allows my to select my favorite music source and it doesn’t have to be Amazon Music, this is new, since 12/17/18. Sounds good but I can use my Sonos speakers with Alexa and going through IFTTT I can use my google home mini too.

5.0,a year ago,Target,Amazing Smart Speaker!,"I was originally very hesitant on buying a $350 speaker. Once I heard the sound quality of this little speaker, I was amazed. You would never believe the sound quality coming out of this speaker, without actually hearing it for yourself. Then on top of the great sound, this allows you to use Siri to control all of the smart devices you have in your home. (I have a ton of hue lights) Then when you think there isn't anything else this can do... if you link a second HomePod into a Stereo Pair, its down right disturbing how deep and wonderful they sound. This is the most I have ever spent on stereo equipment, but its easily a half to a quarter of the price of comparable sounding systems. (without out all of the crazy set up). I love using this with my Apple TV, or just playing music. If you are on the fence, you should give it a try... you wont regret it.Less"

Talk to Apple Support (Case ID 100752840763) they ask did you follow the set up instructions, YES. They have me go through it again, they wait on the phone with me, the HomePod turns off. Then they ask what are you using to stream, I answer 3 different iPhones, an iPod, and my Mac - all running the current OS - same result every time, the HomePod turns off after a few minutes. Then they say maybe its my network, I say its an Apple AirPort Extreme - they say Oh. I get handed off to a supervisor. They ask the same questions, say weve never heard this before. I purchased this HomePod to replace an AirPlay speaker that worked just fine. I wanted the HomePod for the AirPlay 2 capability. Im now using the old AirPlay (non-Apple) speaker again. If I could return this, I would. Dont waste your money on this.Less"
5.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,enjoy the great sound,"This speaker has great sound and great volume. I used it in a public event where the space was acoustically ""hot"" with solid walls, floor, ceiling. The space was about 70' x 150' in size. The HomePod speaker automatically adjusted sound output for the placement and acoustics. It also was able to play a loud and pleasant sound to fill the room. It did a better job than the speakers mounted on the front wall of the space. It works well with or without Apple Music."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Much better than Echo!,"Owned many echo's in the house but always had an issue with music. The sound just was not there. Another issue with Amazon Echo's is if playing music loud, you had to yell to get Alexa's attention. So next thing you knew everyone is screaming for Alexa to have ""volume up"", Stop... and so on. It was irritating. So, once the Apple Home Pod dropped price down a 100 dollars, decided to give it a try. The music quality is incredible! It really does fill the room. Got another one and whole house music is incredible as well!. Changing volume individually for each speaker is very nice from iOS devices. And using the Home Pod microphones for commands is light years ahead of an Echo/Alexa device. We can calmly say ""Hey Siri"" and the HomePod will pick up your voice no problem. AND, she is not dumb. For what we need to ask, she answers. So if you are on the fence, get a HomePod. We have Spotify and we use it as well, we just add the speaker from any device that is playing within the house.Less"
5.0,7 months ago,Micro Center,Great Speaker for Apple Ecosystem,"I understand its limitations related to anything that isn't Apple Music. However, since I am fully ""all-in"" on the Apple ecosystem, it's perfect for me. Very happy with the quality of sound. I debated between this and Sonos and ultimately chose this because of the sound and form factor. I bought two of these to act as a stereo pair most of the time, and then they are easy enough to separate when the occasion requires it. I use it less as a smart speaker and more as just a wireless speaker so I don't really care much about how good or bad Siri is most of the time. Five stars!"
5.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Fantastic Sound,"After messing around with a relative’s Echo, I decided I also wanted one. However, being honest with myself, I knew that I really wanted the HomePod to join in with every other Apple product I own, so come Black Friday, I got myself a bargain (well, sort of). Set up could not be easier (especially when you compare it to other brands). Plug it in, sit your phone close by and enjoy. The sound quality is excellent and it has an awfully high success rate when you make requests. It also looks great too. Surprisingly unobtrusive given its size. Nothing else was required when linking to my Philips Hue lights either. Now as others have touched on, I found “hey Siri” to be a bit random in response regardless of distance/volume until I noticed she responded to a character in an American TV show. Pro tip - try “Hey SeeRee”. Whisper it. Almost a month of owning this before figuring it out. Picks up every time. The “I like/don’t like this” feature is also great with Apple Music.Less"
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Awesome sound from a small package!!,"I wasn’t impressed with the HomePod when I heard it in the store, but the reviews said otherwise so I purchased one. In a home situation the sound is absolutely defying. How can so much sound come from such a small package? I was so impressed that I purchased another one and use them in a stereo configuration. Now it’s two times awesome!! The amount of bass these speakers put out is outrageous. Siri seems to be an attentive listener and quickly finds a song I want to hear or skips tracks or adjusts volume."

Picking this up we thought we would try it and maybe return it if it doesn't work too well. We thought there was no way it's going to stand its ground against our favorite wireless Bose HomeLink speakers but you know what... it really des! We tested it with all kinds of music, the base is deep and satisfying, mid range is good and high range is perfect. No noticeable distortion. What an amazing speaker... not to mention Siri and all the goodies that come with it, of course!"
2.0,6 months ago,ebay.com,Great sound ! Amazing bass ! Not the best to set up .,I love the way the speaker sounds its awesome but it only works with apple products. I use mine to listen to stuff on my Mac using air play. Or to listen to music on my phone. Works with Apple Music. But let me tell you if you are trying to connect it with a different WiFi other than the one at home its a nightmare or atleast it was in my case. I took it to Vegas and connected to WiFi there on my phone and the home pod would not connect but once I got home it connected right away to my home WiFi. Its very limiting. Had to return it. Currently looking for a different speaker.

Both of these I had before I purchased the Homepod.Easy to set up and use.As well as music I use this for my homehub for my shart lights, which is a great feature. Cons: If your wifi network isn't stable the Homepods can drop off. this isn't a negative against the product.You will want to buy a second one if you hear how good they sound in stereo."

We've used Google home, Alexa, etc. Bought one of these, as it was on a good sale at Christmas, and decided to use it in my office. Digital assistant is a great feature, but the sound quality is what really stands out. Plenty of bass, even at low volumes. Easy to pause/play by tapping the top. Adds music to the office without being boomy or harsh sounding. Would love to have two to pair together!"
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Terrific sound quality,My main reason for getting the Apple HomePod speaker was...the speaker itself. The sound quality is superb. This was my second HomePod; now I have stereo. It sounds terrific with my iTunes movies and works great streaming from my iPhone. You need a pair for yourself. Best Buy staff were helpful during purchase for both HomePods. Very friendly. It was not terribly difficult to hook the 2nd one up for stereo (you tell the system which speaker is the Right and which is the Left speaker).
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Buy it for the sound quality,"We wanted to get another smart device to play music, with easy control from the iPhone (that means, not with Sonos). When this went on sale, we immediately grabbed one unit, no question! We already have two Google Home (Mini and Hub), and Amazon Echo (Dot and Spot). We love playing music with HomePod through Airplay because its sound quality surpasses that of Google and Amazon smart devices. Siri also catches your voice command much better than Google and Alexa, even when we are standing farther away. Get it, you won't be disappointed."
4.0,a year ago,John Lewis,"Sounds Great, Shame about the Assistant!","As someone who has a variety of Apple products I thought I'd give Apple's HomePod a go. On the whole using it purely as a music speaker it's great, it's the fact Siri is very limited that lets it down. Pros: 1. Easy to set up. 2. Seems to adjust quite quickly whenever you move it around without having to use an app to reconfigure playback. 3. Works with iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and Mac computers. 4. Works with HomeKit;granted it's lazy but lying in bed and asking Siri to turn off the lights is great! 5. It might not be for everyone but being able to send/receive messages with just your voice is a nice touch. 6. It looks very smart. Cons: 1. It has Bluetooth but you're unable to use the likes of Spotify to stream music. 2. It appears Android customers are excluded unless they use Apple Music. 3. To get the most out of your music collection you need to be a member of Apple Music; you can use iCloud Music and/or your iTunes library but it seems you can't ask Siri to play songs if you're not a subscriber to Apple's services. 4. You can ask what the traffic is like to a particular destination but not what the traffic is like in a general area. 5. You can create reminders but Siri is unable to tell you what's coming up next on your Calendar. 6. You can re-route your phone call (using Bluetooth) but you can't ask Siri to make a phone call for you. I guess Apple might say this is a speaker first and smart assistant second but given the fact the competition allows you to complete more tasks is definitely one of the weakest links when it comes to HomePod. Despite Siri sounding slightly more natural (since iOS 10) I do find his/her voice is stilted compared to her American counterparts. I don't regret buying a HomePod but I personally feel unless you're heavily invested in Apple's ecosystem you might be better off looking elsewhere.Less"
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Better than the reviews,"Let’s be clear the HomePod was never meant to be a smart speaker. Instead it was designed and developed to produce outstanding sound in a compact package within the Apple ecosystem and that is exactly what it does. The sound of speakers is truly subjective and to say if Google Home or Sonos is the better speaker is just that, subjective. One thing is clear the tinny sounding echo or echo dot does not compete in sound quality to the HomePod. Siri does not compete in answering trivia, playing fireplace sounds etc. like Alexa. Siri does take commands in a low voice and does it well. Ask it to play music, set an alarm, play the news, or give the weather no problems. Is it as robust as Alexa? No but it wasn’t made to be that way. Shortcomings? A few... can you ask Siri to stream other music providers through voice commands? No, but you can stream it through Airplay. HomePod does many things well and yes shortcomings exist but the software exists within the HomePod for future upgrades. HomePod is still new but if you are looking for amazing sound particularly if you are signed up to Apple Music you will not be disappointed.Less"
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,"Great sound, but Siri is lacking","First, I bought this to replace an amplifier and two speakers that were taking up too much space in my kitchen, and on that front the HomePod was a great purchase. It sounds just as good as what I had before, with the added benefit of easier connectivity (no need for Bluetooth pairing). Where the HomePod lacks is in its voice capabilities. I frequently accidentally activate Siri when talking to my cat (saying things that sound nothing like “Hey Siri”), and the HomePod consistently has problems recognizing my voice vs my boyfriend’s (I often get the response of “I’m not sure who you are” when trying to add reminders or reading texts)."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great Sounds/Siri Ok,"The HomePod sounds really great. I have to admit the reviews I've seen said it did, but you have to hear this thing to appreciate it. No it's not the best sounding speaker out there, but it's darn good. Siri as we all know is just okay. It works about as I expected it to based on my Siri iPhone and iPad use. I had tried a Google Home Mini at Christmas when they had them for $29 and honestly I used it basically about the same as I do Siri, but eventually returned it. No doubt Google Assistant can do more, but I didn't use those other features, so I don't miss them now with the HomePod. The fact that the HomePod is wrapped around Apple Music is a huge plus for me. I don't subscribe to any Google services and I don't have Spotify or Pandora, so I can't complain about those having to be used through AirPlay. Overall I am very happy with the purchase. I do think it was over priced like most things that Apple has, but I a sure I will get hours and hours of enjoyment and so it's money well spent. If I was looking for a fully capable smart speaker I wouldn't have gotten a HomePod, but it works with Siri in the way I need it and sounds great so it's a keeper!Less"

It really shines when you want to listen to music while walking about in a room v. facing the speaker head on while sitting on a counch. Unlike the other front firing speakers the sound stage on this speaker is great. The bass is very fast, smooth and consistent. In my testing, the HomePods are not only better than the Google Max in terms of sound and design, but can hold their own with my KEF bookshelf’s which I paid over $1,200 for on sale! The HomePods are better for everyday listening. I have an iphone X and I have no problem AirPlaying any source to the HomePod. Also, I have no problems using the HomePod with HomeKit. In the end, Apple Music is my favorite music source so issues like HomePod only responding to music commands from Apple Music isn’t an issue for me,Less"
4.0,a year ago,PC World,Stephen's review of Apple HomePod,"Pros: Capable of producing sound far beyond it's size. extensive range from 40hz. Siri can hear you well, she is listening. Apple Music has an extensive library. Will get you listening to more music because it's so convenient. Tech inside adjusts the low and high frequencies depending on volume to make sure you hear the same thing at 10% as you do at 100% (fletcher munson compensation) Great for watching documentaries on apple TV Netflix (via airplay) due to it's clear voice sound. Cons: Airplay has a 2 second delay so no good as an alternative reference monitor (but still possible) not suitable for listening while going to sleep due to the loud bass. Bass is too loud overall for my taste with no option to adjust it. Is not ""flat"" like suspicious test have said it is. Siri is limited and can get confused on occasion.

The 1st one I bought the day it came out it was lacking a very important feature and I was very disappointed.. So for $380 it was not worth it. But when B&H had it on sale for almost $130 less - I bought it. That feature would be able to tell Siri to play song from a connected apple device. It will not do that. You have to go to the apple device and send the song to the HomePod. So it has only a one-way communication. Of course, you can join Apple tunes and play all you want, but I dont listen to music like that and I find that annoying and why keep on paying money to play music. I have over 150 GB of music on my iMac ripped from CDs.and the library keeps growing. So Im making up playlists and sending that info over to the HomePod. Sound is great and I like the sound when it is connected to my appleTV unit. Another con is that Siri is not that intelligent. Not like Alexa. And often for no reason if your answer is unanswered it starts playing some hiphop garbage from the apple store. What is that about? But again, I should be able to tell Siri to play a tune from my connected laptop or desktop. A big shortcoming.Less"

The sound stage is impressively wide, much more than you’d expect from a speaker this size even though the lack of stereo sound is somewhat noticeable to me.

Sonos isn’t as bass heavy but me and my wife listened to both and found to prefer the Sonos for its great clarity and thought it reproduced the music more as it was intended than the HomePod. Obviously very subjective. Smarts: Sonos wins this hands down with its Alexa integration and upcoming support for google and airplay 2. Siri on the HomePod is basic and not that useful. One positive with the HomePod was how well it can hear you even when the music is loud. Value: Sonos hands down.

1.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Avoid at all cost,"If you are smart you buy a real sound system. Count on spending an inordinate amount of time if you do not use two-factor authentication on you apple account. This MUST be enabled. There is NO CHOICE. You have to network this device to your home internet connection. You have NO CHOICE. You must use WiFi in order to connect instead of bluetooth-you have NO CHOICE. Only Apple knows what CHOICES are best for us. Instead of making a high quality speaker that could be integrated into your sound ecosystem, Apple thinks we want a speaker that can listen to us all the time. This system has no ability to be configured by your laptop or desktop, only your iPad or iPhone. You have NO CHOICE. You cannot simply take it with you and use it as a bluetooth speaker. It must have an internet connection. Anybody naive enough to think Apple doesn't collect personal information should rethink their stance. You are forced to make this unit part of your network. If you do not like any home network security, by all means, buy the HomePod. Now as for sound quality, the sound is not that great. It really is not. It has too much bass. It is too late for me.

To me, sking Siri to pull a song from Apple Music (or podcast from the Apple podcasts) and then play with the sound quality is has (and as seamlessly as it does) is the big seller for me.

I then called Apple Care support and spent 50 minutes repeating the same steps with the same error message. The rep wanted to get another person on the line, but it was now quite late, so I opted for a call back the next day. The call came exactly as scheduled and we reviewed the steps we had taken. We did a reset and the rep had me name the location differently: I had repeatedly chosen “living room” from the choices, since that is where it is. Instead, she said pick sewing room”; tearjerker counterintuitive. However, now the installation was perfect! Don’t ask me why that made a difference!

All in all, homepod is a fantastic speaker.Pricing at $349 seems a bit high, but with regular sales dropping to 250-279 the price is right. If you don’t have speakers, two of these are great.

In spite of that, the stereo effect is natural and clearly audible. As many other reviewers have noted the bass from the Homepods is solid and substantial, though in my opinion it is not over done. Ease of setup is notable and straightforward. Siri obeys my voice commands quite well. I did not purchase these for their smart speaker features as there are other smart speakers that do a better job in that area. However, for music, it is hard to beat the Homepods and I am very much enjoying them.Less"
4.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Great sound with Apple ecosystem issues,"Sounds great and does what I needed, which was to play my music and podcasts from an iPad mini. It would be nice if Apple opened up the ecosystem a bit. For example, it appears that Siri only works on Apple-bought Music; it can't find my other music even though I'm using their app. Also, I use the non-Apple podcast app iCatcher for my podcasts so Siri can't play those. No big deal, you just use Airplay. I downloaded a free internet radio app--Simple Radio--just to test if I could get around Apple's radio subscription. Worked fine, again using Airplay. But it's a lot for just a speaker without much use of Siri. The trouble is the Apple subscription is $99 a year for the rest of your life to use Siri on music, radio, podcasts etc but considering they also store a world of music for you, it's something to think about ...Less"

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Best Smart Speaker for music,I recently took a look at the privacy aspect of having a google home speaker and an amazon echo dot in our house. I opted to get rid of them and buy an Apple HomePod because of the way they handle data requests. The sound quality is fantastic and we are in the apple ecosystem so it integrates nicely with Apple Music and our iPhones. I picked this up when the price point dropped to $250 around the holiday season. That is a good price point for these speakers. They also need to release a mini version that is much cheaper to compete with Amazon and Google in this space.
4.0,a year ago,very.co.uk,Great sound & excellent bass.,"I bought this product a while back, and have been meaning to write a review. I am an Apple fan and enjoy the simplicity of setting a new product up, this was no different. It took less than 5 minutes to get it connected to my account and playing music. It sounds great, with great bass and acoustic music sounds wonderful. The only issue is Siri itself. In the house, we also use Google Home/Mini speakers, which are far more intelligent than Siri curtly is on the HomePod. This can be rectified with software updates, however it does make it difficult to look at alternatives such as the Sonos speakers with Amazon Alexa or the larger Google Home Max. Overall, for sound qualify I would recommend this. If you want the smartest speaker then this isn't the one."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,HomePod is simply stunning!,"I debated on purchasing the HomePod for weeks, initially deciding I didn't need it. But after watching numerous reviews, I decided to give it a try and am so glad I did. This thing has absolutely outstanding audio quality! It has actually brought my music-listening experience to a greater level. It is packed with awesome tech that allows it to be aware of it's placement in a room, plus it's built solid like a tank (you'll notice the weight as soon as you pick it up). The aesthetic design in classic Apple fashion is stunning- the mesh that lines the outside of the device is beautiful and the touch surface looks great. It's well-worth every penny when you consider that it sounds better than some other higher-priced offerings. The only downside I can think of is that it's limited to the Apple ecosystem, meaning anyone that doesn't own iOS devices will be out of luck with compatibility.Less"
5.0,3 weeks ago,John Lewis,Impulse buy,"Bought this on an impulse to go with other Apple products I own. After reading some reviews , from 2019 was a little apprehensive, but since these the software has been updated and the speaker now has the expected functionality I bought it for. Speaker is excellent and the sound quality is superb. No issues with it, so simple to set up and get running. Still hoping the BBC will get its act together and let Apple stream their national stations too instead of worrying about collecting listening statistics as they do with Google and Amazon."
5.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Awesome Sound for Any Room,"Great smart speaker. You have to be integrated with ios devices...at least one to use the features. Also almost as important to have an Apple Music subscription. I’ve heard that since my purchase, the price has also come down some. I was considering buying another cause with two it’s twice as awesome sound. The bass is impressive and so are the vocals. Solid choice for any Apple enthusiast. Of course it would be nice that it’s cheaper...but with the recent price decrease it’s getting better."
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Superb sound from this speaker.,"Excellent sound from this speaker for its size. It is a joy to work in the kitchen and listen to favorite tunes coming from the the dining room. Some problems with Siri finding my Christmas playlist, but this may have become an issue after the creation of new wireless network with newly purchased Netgear Orbi mesh network. With playlist recreated and device deleted and then again added to network, eventually all was good. For Mac aficionados there is nothing better in this Best Buy price range."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Give it time and you’ll be amazed.,Purchased this speaker on an open box special. In the beginning I wasn’t blown away but I quickly realized older music sounded okay. Once I played update higher quality music WOW did the speaker come alive; bass is room filling for a speaker it’s size. I have an amazon echo 2 and there is no comparison sound wise. Siri is adequate when using her for music or menial tasks. The more I listen to the speaker it just seems to sound better than the day before. It must learn your environment over time because it seems to fill the room more and more over time. I can only imagine what two or three of these speakers together sound like. I am not sure it is worth the steep $349 price tag but if you can get it for $300 or less don’t hesitate. Perfect Christmas gift!
5.0,5 days ago,Best Buy,Best smart speaker out there.,I purchased this after owning a Google Home for years. I am heavily invested in the Apple Ecosystem so it made the transition easy. I will say one thing the speakers on his products are amazing so much so that I bought another one to have stereo speaker sound. The only thing that I will say that is a detriment to the speaker is that For some reason it Sometimes responds to the Vocal prompts given to Our Google Home that’s in the room as well. It makes no sense and it doesn’t do it all the time but always responds it when it’s really inconvenient..... it’s kind of funny actually.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Amazing,"I have always been an Apple fan, but I was hesitant on buying this. Before I bought the HomePod I bought a Bose home system but it wasn’t to the quality I wanted it so I returned it. Of course I can’t hookup HomePod to my tv but I was mostly wanting the Bose for music but the HomePod was everything I asked for. It was compact and small enough to fit on my desk out of the way and connects with my phone seamlessly. The set up was so easy. Now every corner of my room has superb audio. The bass actually surprised me, it completely feels the room without over powering. Siri can hear me without shouting even when the music is all the way up. The Siri features don’t do as much as I would like it too but with iOS 12 Apple is adding extended features which I can’t wait for. It doesn’t get better than this. I’m already thinking about buying a second one for my living room.Less"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,"Awesome sound, voice control!","I recently grabbed two HomePods on Black Friday, at a great price, $199 each. I'd been holding out due to the original $349 tag. I love being anywhere in the house and being able to play my favorite songs and albums. If I have an ear worm, I can hear someone better at singing it-- the original artist! I have room-to-room continuity just by saying ""Hey Siri. Play (...) everywhere."" The picture is the paper doodad that the cord comes wrapped around."

Siri is Siri, if you don’t like get on your phone you’re gonna feel the same in the HomePod. Very easy setup and since I only have Apple Music I feel this is perfect for the Apple home. It’s fun to start playing music while not home and freak out those at home. I admit I bought it thinking I needed it for my HomeKit accessories however I didn’t buy enjoyed it enough not to return it."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great sound,"The home pod is great for music. However, It does not have voice recognition which causes challenges with 2 kids. They find it funny to run through the room and change the music on me. There is a stop listening feature, but they figured that one out pretty quickly too. I am also disappointed that it doesn't recognize my existing playlists. It synced with my current music but the lists I had on my iPod are not recognized. While I do have access to everything musically, I like to make my own playlists and so far I have not figured out how to do so with this. Apple wants to make them for me which is ok sometimes, but other times I want my own. Overall I am very happy and look forward to apple improving things such as voice recognition."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Great Speaker, Less than Perfect Assistant","I'm not someone who constantly dogs Siri. It's not the greatest voice assistant compared to Alexa or probably even Google Assistant, however for what does work, Siri is solid. And I find her to be way more responsive in terms of Homekit device like smart lights and the like. That being said, the HomePod is a tremendous speaker. If you are deeply steeped into the Apple ecosystem, as I am, it will serve you well. The ability to shout ""play this song"" into the air is a killer feature and the key reason I'm on Apple Music over the more superior Spotify. If you are an Apple Music user, I can't recommend this speaker enough. Buy it on sale. The full price tag on this speaker is way too much."
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,"Excellent shipping, price, and service","I bought this for my wife who wanted a “Bluetooth speaker”, and she was blown away by this! B&H’s price couldn’t be beat (I originally bought a returned one from another store, and returned it when B&H was $80 less expensive for a new one!). As far as shipping and service, I was promised that it would arrive before Christmas; I ordered it on the 18th, and it showed up on the 22nd in a well designed box. Not sure if this was B&H, but the box it was shipped in isolated the HomePod well. OK, now to the setup: I did have some issues getting it set up. Since all of our home automation devices are in my “Home”, my wife couldn’t add it to her account, as her iPhone said that only the person that had the “Home” on their account can add devices. She is set up to add devices in my Home settings. After a call to Apple Support and an upgrade to her iPhone and the HomePod, it was added to my “Home”, and then I went into settings and changed the account that the HomePod was logged into to hers. This was done by selecting the HomePod in my Home app, and then under settings, put Account. All is good in the world now.Less"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Love my home pod!,"Initially I wasn't sure about purchasing this speaker, as it is a first generation product. I bought is as an open box in excellent condition and it has blown me away ever since setting it up. I activated my 3 month trial of Apple Music, as I had previously used Spotify everyday, I have to say that I love using Apple Music. The sound of this speaker, which I set up in my living room is incredible. It is loud and clear. The depth and richness of the music produced is amazing. In comparison to my Sony smart speaker, I can really feel and hear the bass in my music. I am hoping for bluetooth connectivity in the future, but that being said, it works seamlessly with all of my apple products. I connected it to my apple iMac as well and have not used my regular speakers since. If you can find it on sale or purchase as an open box it is a great buy! I also enjoy casting my playlists on You Tube to it. Enjoy!Less"
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,"Excellent Sound, Terrific Functionality","I am pleased with the purchase - Just as the iPod was used to listen and catalog music the HomePod performs this task as well as any other platforms available (obviously this one working within the IOS Ecosphere). I am not looking for the best virtual assistant or a single interface to automate my home (fine using my iPhone and the various apps to take care of that). I wanted the best jukebox for the money and without a doubt the HomePod is it. Set-up is as simple as it gets, Siri is more than capable for delivering the ultimate music experience - immediately delivering up pretty much any song or custom music channel you can dream up (play alternative bands from the 90’s with only one hit). In addition if you want to know the weather, time, stock market etc... no problem. I am fine not ordering Domino’s or Uber without grabbing my phone and don’t need a shout out trivia partner or spell checker. Speaker Phone capability would be nice and I suspect will present itself with a software update in the future. From a sound perspective this speaker is impeccably designed to fill a room and does just that. Not stereo is also not a concern music sounds great from anywhere in the space at any volume. In fact people walking in have to look around to figure where the music is coming from - certainly not a set of bookshelf Klipsch speakers where you need to sit in that perfect location to enjoy the music. If you are an IPhone / Ipad customer that can afford the cost go for it. I think for 95% of folks out there this sitting on a shelf somewhere will replace their tuner/amps and conventional speakers leaving them to wonder what to do with the new found space (might want to pick up some plants on the way home). As far as comparing to Android and Google, I’m fine living and paying for the IOS Ecosystem not looking to convince anyone Apple is better. I’ll let the trolls out there convince you of that or tell you how stupid I am and what a sucker You have to be etc....Less"
1.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Be Clear about the Cons,"Great sound. That is where it ends. 1. can only set up with one iphone and so only ONE user 2. Not really integrated with anything (cannot play Pandora or spotify etc) 3. Took 2 hours to get my iphone set up with it (because i also have kids on my icloud account and it was confused) 4. you CANNOT move the homepod to a different place in the house easily if it has a different access point or router name 5. NO BLUETOOTH! so you cannot simply stream music in the yard or garage outside of wifi range. CANNOT TAKE TO BEACH OR PARK 6. THis is an Alexa (echo) knock off with far fewer features. 7. You cannot use it without giving your credit card, creating apple keychain, etc. (you do not need any of that with Alexa) 8 This is NOT A BLUETOOTH SPEAKER (too bad). 9. It is very pricey and demands that you stay in the ""apple ecosystem"" (that is fancy wording for if it ""ain't apple then we do not talk to it"" You can play Apple music by command and that is about it. I have the greatest respect for the (late) Steve Jobs and I do not think that he would have released this product in this way. I only bought it as I thought it was a bluetooth speaker. I already have an Echo. I have no use for this. Very expensive mistake.Less"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great addition to your other Apple products,"I recently purchased an Apple HomePod for myself as a little b-day gift. After living with the speaker for a while, here is what I can offer. 1. Set-up is perhaps the easiest I've ever done for a network device. Plug it in, hold your iPhone near it, and it automatically starts the set-up for you. Click a few buttons on your phone to complete the set-up and you're up and running in like a few minutes. Very nice. 2. Once set up, using the speaker is amazingly simple, yet feature-rich. ""Hey Siri, play some Coltrane"", or ""Hey Siri, play Music for Airports by Brian Eno"" and in about 2 seconds, it starts playing. Too loud or quiet? Just say ""Hey Siri, raise/lower the volume"" and it'll take care of that. 3. Ask it the weather, or what your appointments are for tomorrow. It seems like it can pretty much do it all. 4. The ""ring"" issue. Some people have found that the speaker can leave a ring on some wood surfaces. You can go ahead and buy a little $10 stand to put it on. I just used a folded piece of paper. Works great. 5. Let's talk about sound. Plenty of reviews talk about the great sound, and for its size, the sound is impressive. Don't expect your HomePod to sound like Tannoys or a nice pair of vintage Klipschorns, but the sound is pretty good. It's an active speaker, so it adjusts its sound reproduction based on its surroundings. So don't worry too much about where you're putting it. It can adjust. Speaking of Coltrane, I played ""A Love Supreme"" and was actually impressed. The bass solo sounded pretty decent, not as muddy as I would expect a small woofer to be. The drum solo sounded relatively tight. The piano was missing a bit of brightness, but still more than passable. Sax just stood out nicely. Overall, the sound was more natural that I was expecting, and definitely better than the artificial sound you'd get from a similarly-sized speaker from Bose. 6. Volume control. You can tell it to raise or lower the volume, or tape the plus/minus sign on top. I do wish the volume increments were a bit smaller, though. Raising the volume sometimes is a bit too high and I wish it could raise it just a little bit less. But this is a minor issue in my book. 7. The power cord. OK, yeah, I'm making a point of the power cord. They actually give you a decent-length cord! I know this seems like a small issue, but I do get tired of getting electronics that have these short, dinky power cords. In all, I think this would make a fine addition to your home, assuming you are well-invested in the Apple ecosystem.Less"
1.0,a month ago,John Lewis,Great sound dreadful software,There is no doubt that the HomePod has the best sound quality of any smart speaker but it is currently badly let down by its operating system and particularly Siri. On the HomePod Siri seems incapable of finding numerous items of music in my iTunes Match library. Music which can be found by Siri on iPhones and IPads. The bugs in the software and the apparent lack of urgency by Apple to resolve the problem significantly impacts on the usability and enjoyment of the product.
4.0,a year ago,Currys,Joseph's review of Apple HomePod,"Pros: Beautiful design. Wonderful musical cadence and well balanced and strong sound. For now it represents a superior product to its closest competitors. Cons: Siri, does by and large respond to your requests. However, there certain deficiencies in as much that it does not always respond to one’s requests and altough Apple vaunts it has a huge music base of songs there are notable lacunae especially when trying to source certain Soca / carnival music from a particular year’s hit parade. I find this annoying as you can easilyYouTube these songs your wish to listen to which for inexplicable reasons Siri does not allow you to access. Apple needs to review such criticisms and make it easier to access its putatively vast music data base.It is expensive when compared to its nearest rivals in terms of sound quality.Less"
5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Love the HomePod,Let me start by saying I love this speaker and ended up buying more. This speaker has gotten a lot of uninformed reviews on youtube and there's been so many conflicting accounts about what it does and what so and so thinks. Who cares? Don't worry about what Android users or Spotify users think about the HomePod. I never ask them what they think about my phone not that it's ever stopped them from inflicting their opinions on me. It's not for them and that's why it was perfect for me. I love the build and quality. I've purchased 4 so far for the house and I love them. I'm also a long time Sonos user and have other AI speakers in the house but for the above reasons and because I love/use other Apple products I almost always use the HomePod everyday which I can't say about the others. It's ok to have competing products and use the ones you love. You know what's right for you and in this case the HomePod is the right speaker for me and my needs.Less
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great for the price I paid!,"I am a big fan of Apple and what kept me away from buying the HomePod was because of how expensive it was. When Best Buy offered it at $250, I finally gave in. Apple invested a lot into making this a great speaker and it definitely delivers. Music sounds amazing for such a small form factor. Siri works fine for me, and is able to hear me from almost anywhere in my home. Keep in mind, the HomPod isn't for everyone. You really need to be heavily invested with the Apple ecosystem to get the most out of HomePod. And if you're looking for the most advanced virtual assistant, you need to look elsewhere. For my needs, it's perfect. This review is based on the price that I paid for it. At regular price, it's not a good value. For $250 and if you're invested in iTunes, Apple Music, HomeKit, and Apple devices, I would highly recommend the HomePod.Less"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Buy it!,"First off, live person here, not a paid review. My home is filled with Apple products so naturally I gravitated towards the HomePod despite there being several other options in the market. My primarily goal was the sound of the device and the HomePod delivers. Additionally, I've grown to use the Siri functions and actually find many of them to be quite helpful (setting alarms, playing music, setting timers, random Siri questions, etc.). The HomePod integrates seamlessly with Apple Music and also allows me to play anything via AirPlay. Lastly, the HomePod doubles as my device used to play sound for my AppleTV and that integration is rather seamless as well. Will I didn't pay the full $349 retail price, I do feel the speaker alone is worth the investment and the Siri functionality is an added bonus.Less"
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Not an Alexa/Echo killer yet but give it time,"Let me put this in perspective, I own 4 Amazon Echos of all styles, I owned the Google Home (horrible product) and I own a complete Sonos system including Playbar and Play Ones and Sub. This device was not meant right now to be just a smart speaker but in my mind, a smart speaker/solid all in one speaker. I am a member of Apple Music and this device fits nicely into the Apple echo-sphere nicely playing nice with Apple TV, iPhone and even Mac. The device is so easy to set up much like all Apple products and unlike Echo, I am not fighting with it to play certain songs or search out my playlists etc. I have not tried it with home devices, however thats why I have Echo to function with those devices. This device looks stylish on the counter and the sound is unbelievable and it tunes automatically to the location you place it without you even noticing. Sorry Sonos One but it actually sounds better than a stand alone Play One and even though it is pricier, I can imagine Apple has lots of plans for this device down the road. I am actually enjoying listening to the millions of songs offered in Apple Music which is much better than Amazon Music. Siri is not great yet but I feel in time there will be improvements as with any Apple product.Less"

Sure, I can play the rest of the songs - if I manually select them and use Airplay, defeating the purpose of all the smart functionality of a Homepod. There is a workaround, of course. Pay $10 a month in perpetuity to Apple for Apple Music, and now I can play ALL my songs using Siri. Doesn’t sound like a lot - until you realize youll pay $1,200 over the next ten years to play music you already paid for and own over your $350 retail smart Apple device.

2.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,I wanted to like it.,I bought the HomePod with high hopes of it being a music powerhouse. Truth is it just isn’t. Apple has a great idea in the HomePod but it seems like the capped the music at about 80 percent what it’s capable of. Bass was good but volume wasn’t there to really impress me. The hey Siri works awesome though. And I’m sure it has a bunch of great features with home automation and such that are awesome too. Just not for me. Bottom line. Don’t buy this for your music if you want volume. Buy it for it’s other features.

I will be purchasing another in the next few months. Beats the Echo devices and Google homes for sure (in terms of sound!!) THE ONLY complaint I have is this: I have them paired with each other, one's in the living room and the other in the bedroom. I know I know, I promise I'm not that much of a snob in real life. I haven't had any hiccups with sound delay BUT what I do find annoying is only one of them will register my voice and respond back. A silly nuisance, but did want to call that out!

Probably the biggest CON for the HomePod is the fact that for some reason Apple thinks this is a single user device. Come on Apple add a feature that allows each user to be signed in to the device and to start a session they could say Hey, Siri, its... saying their name and it would then respond using that users credentials. Need to change users just say Hey, Siri, its... using another username. Side note its time for profiles on the Apple TV as well. Not all devices are single user devices Apple. I do actually like the HomePod and may add a few more to fill my home with music. It is easy to use (for a single user) and a convenient way to enjoy music.Less"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Wonderful sound and useful,"I’m a huge fan of Apple, so it’s. I surprise that I like my HomePod. It’s a wonderful addition to my setup, and it makes controlling my smart home devices much easier. Siri can hear me much more easily using the HomePod than she can using my phone or watch. I’m a lazy lazy man, and I hate light switches. I just want to tell someone to turn off the lights for me, and since my wife is just as lazy as I am, Siri is the best. I also use it as the sound for my Apple TV. I don’t have a sound bar or anything, and the TV speakers are not the best, but with this item, the sound is much more full and more immersive. It’s not as good as my home theater setup I have downstairs, but for a bedroom, it’s great. Now I just need a second one, to link them in a stereo setup."

If you are like me and have Mac devices, this will tie in nicely with your Apple account to play your music. If you have a subscription to Apple Music, it will play anything there. It will not, however, play Pandora or other non-Apple services. It works with Siri, so you can do voice commands (on/off, raise/lower volume, play a certain song/singer or playlist, etc.). If you are linked to wifi, Siri will answer questions (weather forecast for example) just like an Amazon or Google device. It is sorta big, but not obtrusive, and it is heavy, which is a good thing. It's Apple, so you'll overpay for it, so getting here at $100 off is a great deal."

I've seen comparisons of this vs. other soundbars and even though it doesn't get as loud (which is not as necessary) it is much clearer.

The sound quality is excellent. Bass is not heavy handed, but it is strong. Siri picks you up wherever you are in the room, even if you whisper. This is a purchase that you will not regret."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Amazing with one HUGE flaw,"So I was very excited to be one of the first to get the new Homepod as I love most Apple products. The sound blew my mind right in the store! So I got home and set up was pretty easy however that's when I discovered the HomePod's big flaw! It doesn't connect to your phone or ipad via bluetooth like most speakers. It operates under the premise that you have Apple Music (which I do) however it will play songs based on what you tell Siri to play. Most times you're scrolling through your music on your phone and you press a song to hear it. The Home Pod only let's you play pre made playlists that you create or you tell it to play a specific song. I was surprised how much of a pain that was. Luckily rumor is that Apple is working to fix that otherwise I'd have returned it even though it sounds great! Get on that, Apple!Less"
5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,The Sound Proves It. . .Now That's What I Call Smart!,"Apple's HomePod is a really smart speaker, which thanks to serious levels of engineering, produces sound better than anything I've heard in such a small unit. The heft when removing the HomePod from it's box, instantly lets you know that you are holding something very special indeed. A few minutes later, after painlessly setting up via an iOS device, you are met with an incredible sound. It is simply. . . WOW!. Siri, the onboard musicologist, works as intended and depending on how you have Siri set up, can set reminders, alarms, control HomeKit compatible Smart Gadgetry (like Philips Hue lights). I absolutely love my HomePod and am very pleased that I bought one. The HomePod is a properly smart speaker. The sound proves it."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great speaker and addition to other apple products,"I recently purchased an Apple HomePod before the holidays when it’s was on sale for $199. I waited for a sale to purchase one and the sound and quality is excellent. Set up was simple: just plug it in and hold your device near it. HomePod has great sound and it may not be the Best but it suites my needs. Fun to use, and learning more and more about what you can do with it each day. Next time it goes on sale again I probably will purchase another."
5.0,a year ago,Target,"Excellent speaker choice at $250, Expensive at list","HomePod is a speaker that is on equal footing as Sonos One. Pairing produces excellent stereo quality. The sound quality is excellent and is near premium quality. It is a great solution for Apple centric customers. Airplay 2 extends the content capabilities of HomePod working very well with iPhone and iPad. Can make for an excellent speaker for Apple TV. At $350, the speaker is a high-priced alternative and hard to rationalize the premium as compared to alternatives. At $250, it is easier to justify the price as compared to Sonos One. The microphone sensitivity is the leader in the field. Siri continues to improve and works very well with HomeKit."
4.0,6 months ago,John Lewis,Apple HomePod review,Purchased the Apple HomePod from John Lewis in London with a wedding present with a gift voucher for a wedding present we received. I love Apple and have got most of their products which I adore. This HomePod is great and looks the part. The only problem is not being able to play my own playlist of music. The main reason for the purchase was the play music and I can’t because it asks to sign up to Apple Music which is a monthly charge. I’m quite disappointed but it does not ruin my reputation for Apple.
5.0,10 months ago,Argos,Great sound from such a small package.,"The sound quality from such a small unit is amazing. Set up and use is typically “Apple”, very simple! Easier than the Amazon Echo’s I recently set up for my parents. That said, the HomePod is expensive and, as long as volume is not pressed too high, the Echo sounds very good. Also, once set up, Amazon’s “Alexa” is better to use than Apple’s “Siri”, though not by a huge margin. If money not an object or if you’re invested in Apple then HomePod is easy to recommend."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Pleasantly surprised,"I'm an Apple junkie, but even I looked at this product with skepticism when it was announced. Regardless given my elite plus status, I figured it was worth a shot. My home is pretty heavily outfitted with Hue bulbs and Wemo outlets. Previously i was interfacing with these primarily through Alexa, but to my surprise Siri is taking on this job with equal proficiency and superior speed. Like seriously, Siri/Homekit is FAST. In my experience Siri is also a bit more forgiving when it comes to saying the exact name of lights. Most of all however, is Siri on homepod has impeccable hearing. Even at the loudest volume playing music, I can speak in a normal tone and she will hear me correctly. Having had Alexa, I really didn't believe this was possible until I tried it for myself. On this note, when it comes to ""Hey Siri"" it seems that homepod always takes precedence. Generally this is appreciated, but there have a been a few times where I have been in another room and I expect siri to answer on the phone in my hand and ultimately the homepod in my living room heard me. At this point thats kinda more amusing than annoying. On top of being a capable voice assistant the HomePod can really bring the house down musically. Holy cow! Really, seriously, put this thing in your house and play Hotel California live on full blast. Close your eyes. Its indistinguishable from being front row at a concert. Eerily you can move about the room and into nearby rooms and the sound just doesn't change, I guess that's the magic of the acoustic mapping this thing apparently does. All this to say, once again, Apple produces something that made everyone skeptical that emerges the pinnacle of the space it competes in.Less"
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Shadows of greatness, body of incompetence","I’ve been an Apple user for over a decade, and as someone that made a career making iOS apps, I really hoped the HomePod would have stepped up the game for personal assistants. The problem isn’t necessarily what it’s bad at (primarily being that it can only be tied to a single user), it’s that it isn’t particularly good at anything beyond just being a great speaker. The voice commands work decently enough, but there’s such a vast lack of compatibility beyond texting/calling somebody that it’s essentially a voice-activated speaker phone + weather announcer. Pair this with its inability to determine users based on who’s connected to the same Wi-Fi, vocal signatures, etc., and this device will leave you underwhelmed. The audio quality is bar none, but without better features, your money would be better spent elsewhere.Less"
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Updated review on stereo pairing Homepods,"I've updated my previous rating from 4 to 5 stars. The reason being that I discovered if I place the Homepods at ear-level and equidistant from a listening position, I get the imaging and depth I thought were missing months ago. At that time I place them on top of my existing speakers and they were slightly above my ear level. Now, with the lower placement I get more precise imaging of the music. The precision of vocals, esp females like Jennifer Warnes, is excellent. If there is a fault, it may be the upper frequencies that seem to drop off, or it may just be my aging hearing abilities. I really am enjoying the Homepods much more now. Siri has gotten better too, with the recent software updates. Highly recommended!"
5.0,a year ago,John Lewis,HomePod - A 'must have' for the dedicated Apple user,"The sound performance of the HomePod is excellent - the bass response is exceptional in such a small speaker. Siri support is useful, but really comes into its own if you subscribe to Apple music or use home automation. HomePod will also play any Apple music you have purchased and stream audio from an iPad, iPhone, Mac or AppleTV. The only real downsides are the cost (high) and the inability to stream audio from non Apple devices. The instructions are very simple - hold your iPhone close to the HomePod and it will auto-configure from the phone's settings. The HomePod will appeal to Apple enthusiasts, and despite its limitations, it shouldn't disappoint."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Love our homepod,"We use our HomePod to turn our home into a smart home. We can now control the lights, locks, security camera and everything else with Siri. We even programmed different scenes- when we tell Siri it’s dinner time, she turns on the lights by the table and flashes the lights upstairs so the kids know to come down for dinner. Gone are the days that I have to track everyone down. Loving this new feature in our house. It is also an amazing speaker to play music, it’s loud and the quality is great. The only reason I am giving it 4 not 5 stars is because Alexa integrates with more things that Homekit. But since we are an all Apple household this just made more sense to us."
5.0,a month ago,John Lewis,Great Speakers for Apple addicts,Purchased 2 as a treat and to replace previous floor speakers. At the moment they are in different rooms but you can set them up for stereo sound in one room. They work seamlessly with Apple Music and I listen to the radio with them too. Lovely little speakers that don’t dominate the rooms yet fill them with fantastic sound quality. I compared one to my old iPod’s Bowers and Wilkins speaker - much better.
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,A speaker for those who care about sound,"HomePods (especially two/stereo) sound very satisfying. They need rubber stands, o/w rings occur. I already had Apple Music -perfect. SIRI provides all the basic info: iMessage, Calendar, Weather, Phone calls, and general info. I have not used with Apple TV yet. We have them set up in the bedroom. They are rather innocuous. They can even double as a white noise machine/alarm clock. A lot of fun."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Nice sound, enjoy voice control, but...","We are an Apple/Mac family so treated ourselves to the HomePod for Christmas. Really impressed with the sound, bass to tweeters, and it does seem to intelligently shape the sound to the room. We are also Spotify users and found we can play with AirPlay through the speaker. But to use Siri and voice control you need to use Apple music. So we signed up for the 3 mos. free Apple music. To use Siri reliably, you've got to study up on how to ask Siri for the music you want and its often hit or miss. And its nice to ask for the weather or the news. But we don't get the same selection of music that we have saved with Spotify so not sure we will keep the Apple Music at $10 month. Our hope is that Spotify will eventually work like Apple Music with Siri. So its the music issue that led us to give it four stars.Less"
4.0,5 months ago,Argos,Looks minimalist sounds fantastic.,"From such a small device the sound is fantastic. Crystal clear audio with a fair amount of floor rumbling bass. It blends in nicely into my living room. As the grey fabric matches my curtains!!! Let down by connectivity issues. Every couple of days it just looses WiFi connection which requires a switch off at the plug. It’s a small issue at the moment, but one I can live with because it just sounds soo good !"
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Incredible sound!,"I know it's marketed as a smart speaker, but honestly you spend seconds per day using the smart feature, but hours listening to music. That's where this speaker absolutely impresses. Compared to my Sonos setup, this speaker has greater range, better detail, and plays cleaner at louder levels than Sonos. This coming from an Android phone user. Rest of the family uses iPhones so I do have an Apple Music subscription. I think the Homepod is well worth it."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great! For music...,"Picked up a pair of HomePods while they were on sale during Christmas. I had to update the firmware/software before I was able to configure as a stereo pair. For music, these sound unbelievable with great bass. However if you want the full functionality you must be an Apple Music subscriber. Now the downside. If you are picking these up to use as speakers for your AppleTV, I was dissapointed with the volume even turned all the way up. My budget 2.1 soundbar which costs less than a single HomePod produced much better sound quality. Overall I am satisfied with the product at the discounted/sale price, but would only recommend if you are an Apple Music subscriber, and your primary purpose is to listen to music."
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,"Good speakers, could be better","Plus: - The sound from the speakers are good - it's easy to send stuff from other apple devices - it deals well with simple commands/queries (weather, time, etc.) Cons: - Siri is a lot more limited on this than on the phone. - HomePod's Siri interferes with iPhone Siri when both are on. Sometimes I'll ask my phone something and the HomePod will answer and say it can't do that. - It works better if you have apple music, and takes an extra step to use if you want to beam spotify from your phone... but it's just an extra step."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Excellent Home Speaker,Bought this HomePod for our Home Office. The first one that we purchased is in our Kitchen. The update to iOS 13.3 makes this a very usable and stable Home Speaker with Siri. Very good sound quality and build. Hope they keep improving this product. Will pay the higher price versus selling our privacy for a substandard home speaker that never turns off day or night. Kudos Apple for designing and selling this product.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Amazing sound,I'll admit I was hesitant at first to buy this HomePod.... But once I received it and started to learn how it works.. I was hooked. The sound is AMAZING! The same tap action your used to on other devices such as 1 tab to start/stop... double tap to go to the next song... The usual ask Siri almost anything... But I'll admit I'm still learning everything it can do. If you decide to buy one for yourself... go through the tutorials and help and learn a few things. I'm still learning but overall very happy with my purchase.
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Incredible Sound Quality, Lacking Smart Features","One of my old roommates had an Alexa smart speaker. When we moved apart, I decided to get my own smart speaker. I decided to go with the HomePod for a few reasons: 1. I am a user of Apple Music 2. Sound quality is extremely important, and this is my primary speaker 3. Apple's data privacy is second to none (not the case with Amazon or Google) Overall, I am happy with my purchase. The sound is incredible, and I feel I constantly ""rediscover"" old albums due to the sound quality. But the smart features are..... lacking is almost too generous. This is essentially a speaker/alarm, and not much else. Hopefully Apple continues to improve the software and voice recognition features of this device."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Best sound I've ever heard in a home,"5 stars for the sound quality. I've heard many home speakers and this little thing surpasses them all (including large entertainment systems). I can feel the bass vibrate my chest even when the volume isn't at max. No distortion; crystal-clear sound. It's true, Siri is not as smart as Alexa. The HomePod has been great for controlling my Hue lights and Koogeek smart outlets. Siri also has deep knowledge of the music it plays, so it's not like the functionalities are THAT limited. An example of a limitation: you can use the HomePod as a speaker phone, but you can't tell Siri to make a phone call for you, which is a little odd. I anticipate Siri's capabilities to become more advanced with future software updates. Apple said their goal was to make a speaker with great sound, and they definitely hit the mark. As for the microphones, they are surprisingly good. Siri can hear me from another room, and also hear me softly say ""Hey Siri"" when loud music is playing. Yes, voice commands for music will only work with Apple Music. This is not a problem for me because I've been an Apple Music user from the start. If you use Spotify, you can still play it from your phone over Bluetooth and tell Siri things like: ""next track,"" ""pause,"" ""turn up the volume,"" and other basic commands. If you say ""Hey Siri, play [a song]"" it will go straight to Apple Music. All in all: If you're looking for sound quality above everything, the HomePod is perfect.Less"
5.0,a week ago,Best Buy,Great sounding speaker for Apple Systems,"If you want to use Apples HomeKit, you’ll need a HomePod. The sound quality and ease of use follows Steve Jobs saying, “it just works!” Love this little speak with big sound. I wish they advertise the tech they put into this device. E.g. the sound quality won’t breakup if you push the speakers to the limits because the speaker itself will make Micro adjustments to bass and treble to give the best sound! Now that’s high tech!!!"
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Half-baked as a smart speaker,"As an Apple fan it pains me to not recommend the HomePod. Now as a speaker with Apple Music it is fantastic and if that is what you want you should hands down purchase one. I have Apple Music and it integrates and sounds amazing on the Homepod. What is frustrating is the weakness of everything else. It constantly misunderstands (except oddly with Apple Music commands) the queries given to Siri. It frustrates me when my iPhone and Hompod fight for control (Apple needs to get their act together on this). It's a nightmare using it with the Home App (although I don't know if this is an issue with my Phillips Hue Lights, the Homepod or both). Bottom line if you must have the best speaker for Apple Music this is for you. All others: what till Apple makes it more useful and stable."

My parents love being able to listen to music, podcasts and *some* phone calls though the Home pod. It is an excellent device except in the phone call area. The phone call portion does work for ONE Apple ID. However, the Apple website (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208341) implies that other Apple IDs can route phone calls through the Home pod. We even called Apple support and were informed that only ONE Apple ID could make phone calls. Again, leave it to Apple to make a product that not only looks amazing but sounds amazing. Its just it doesn’t work as well as implied. Hopefully in the future Apple will fix this."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Incredible sound, lackluster functionality","A no-brainer if you’re in the Apple HomeKit ecosystem. For the price, nothin rivals the quality of sound this outputs. Close your eyes to Mozart and you feel as if you’re at the symphony (especially if you have two of them working in stereo), or throw a party and the bass will make everyone move. It packs a beefy A10 processor that leaves plenty of headroom for future Siri improvements and future proofing. Best smart speaking currently on the market, by far."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Great Product, not great bonus","Love the homepod and am excited to link it up with other smart home features. Love playing music through it with great ease. However, it states free 3 month trial of apple music with purchase. I already had activated my 3 month trial and this benefit was of no use as it is only for brand new apple music subscribers. All in all, it should specify instead of leading you to believe you can stack your free 3 month trials when purchasing apple products."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Just wow,"I know I know! Your thinking ‘why would anyone ever spend that much money on smart speaker’ ‘when Alexa is cheaper’ while yes in cost it’s cheaper but you loose out on quality and if your already in the Apple ecosystem (I myself have an iPhone and a Mac) but I like them for what I need them for. I’m by no mean anti any other device. Ive just found these tools to be easier for me. But besides the point. This speaker is amazing. It completely fills my apartment from its centeral location which real crisp and powerful tones and base. The ‘Hey Siri’ function can hear you from almost anywhere even at full volume. There is a curve to learning how to use the Homepods ‘Hey Siri’ Function. But over all I love it. I’m ready to buy a second one, which they do also sync by themselves."
4.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Sound is Okay,"I bought two of these speakers as I am an Apple enthusiast generally. The fidelity and sound quality is OK but, they sit side by side with some Genelec 5"" monitors, which are much more transparent and clear than the HomePods. The integration is a bit buggy and the voice recognition is also buggy. I have been in the middle of an important conversation and they HomePods start talking back. I am generally happy with them but I expected higher fidelity, but I am comparing them to professional monitors costing twice as much."

Even to this day there are times that I am just blown away at how clear and crisp the music comes out. The one thing that I really like and haven't seen in other reviews, is the use of home pod to replace my sound bar and subwoofer. I found myself constantly adjusting the volume up and down through different scenes with the soundbar. The home pod has solved this problem. Easily works with the apple TV, producing very clear and balanced audio. If you use an Apple TV and subscribe to apple music then home pod is a must have!"

1.0,3 months ago,John Lewis,Be aware of its limitations,"We bought this in ignorance, the sound quality is excellent which is what convinced my wife and I to invest. That’s it however, the million and one additional things we were used to with Echo and Alexa simply proved way too much trouble with this HomePod and HomeKit. It simply doesn’t work, Phillips hue needs a bridge to connect, so lights don’t work through Siri unless I spend another £50. It’s a shame but this is typical Apple products not playing with others."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Buy TWO or More,"I read all the ""'hey Siri', is not Alexa or Google"" and that is alright, I can look up things too on the internet, I'm not lazy, but the Apple Homepod is the best in this speaker class and beyond. The sound is the best, better than Bose or any other brand. I bought two and set it up as stereo speakers. Bass to Treble is beautiful and well balanced. You do feel the Bass but it's not overpowering. The sound actually feels like a 3D sound not a surround sound. I bet in the near future, they will be able to incorporate that surround sound with having multiple Homepods configuring with one another about distance and sound levels. You will love this Homepod. ""hey Siri"" will evolve."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,I LOVE IT!,"By far, the best electronic device I purchased during the holiday season while it was still on sale. Compliments the Apple echo system of the iPhone or iPad streaming Apple Music to the HomePod. The sound is amazing. It's all the great sound in one small device without all the wires and components those ""back in the day"" systems required (e.g., turntable, tape deck, speakers, etc.). Yes, Siri will need improving, but it will only get better with further iOS upgrades. Read reviews and capabilities before I purchased it on what it can do and what it can't (e.g., what apps don't work with it). And you can control the volume via your iPhone too! Highly recommend if you're into Apple."
3.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,"Great Sound, Poor Interaction.",I have both the HomePod and the Sonos 1. The HomePod sounds better but Sonos app provides better interaction. The Sonos app becomes a central hub which also all the devices to see and change what is playing. HomePod runs in the background which is cool b/c it lets you play movie and other content but other users (devices) can see what its playing or the source. So on HomePod you basically just over right what the other device is doing to play what you want. For example one user (a) starts playing a playlist then another user (b) whats to see whats in the playlist or skip a song etc. on HomePod there is no interaction for this. For me this is a huge downside and needs to be a major update for Apple. For the money Sonos 1 is a steal vs the HomePod.
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Great speaker,"This is a heavily reviewed item already by professional reviewers. YouTube/google it for a much better/in depth review. But this is a great speaker with amazing sound quality especially for the size. Only drawback is no physical plug in and you can’t pair it via Bluetooth yet (hopefully one day). I bought this one as a second one to play as stereo and up the sound. I’ve had my first one for about a year or two (when ever it first came out) Love it, wish I got my first one at this price."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Best in Class sound quality,"I’ve been interested in the generally lukewarm reviews for the HomePod that have appeared in the media. The consensus seems to be that the HomePod is a great sounding speaker, but that owners are locked into the Apple “walled garden,” and that Siri, while good, is not quite on par with Alexa and the Google Personal Assistant. I guess my review falls along the same lines, but with a different point of emphasis. I use Apple Music already for my streaming and playlists. Is Apple Music necessarily the best streaming service out there? Probably not — I think that Spotify, and Google Music, and Amazon Music are all quite good (I’ve used them all, over the years) but that Apple Music is quite good as well. So I am already committed to that part of “the garden.” And with that said, this speaker really, truly does sound fantastic! Warm, crisp, detailed, good tight bass, a very neutral sound, great for classical, acoustic, folk, jazz. I have listened to a lot of the different speakers out there, and the HomePod is, to me, an order of magnitude better sounding. So, if you use Spotify or Google Music, if you really want the best personal assistant to answer questions and such, then perhaps the HomePod is only good, rather than great. But if you use Apple Music already and sound quality is important to you (I am squarely in this camp) then the HomePod is fantastic, and well worth the money.Less"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Use it for music,"I am really deep into the Apple ecosystem. I used other phones for a while but landed with iPhones. I went all in and got all the tech that I could. With that of course I got Apple Music. The HomePod gets all its music from your Apple Music account, so it worked perfect for me. Siri can hear you literally anywhere in the living room and kitchen, sometimes even my bedroom. But don’t think you’re buying a smart speaker. Sure it can control lights and everything. But what you’re really spending money on is the sound quality. Is sounds super great from anywhere in the room. You can even airplay music and it still sounds amazing. Buy it if you want an amazing speaker."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Almost Perfect Product,"This thing sounds amazing with music. It cranks it out at a decent level and I really can hear it fill the room with it's ""bounce off the wall"" technology. As an Apple Music subscriber, this really is a quality speaker. The only nitpick I have (which is a big disappoint me for me as an Apple TV superfan) is that the sound quality when airplayed from an Apple TV is rather low. Decent but low. It's already a favorite product for me but I'd praise it as a must have if it produced the same quality for movies as it did for music. IDK the specs of it enough to know if or how that would be possible but it's the only thing keeping it from a 5 star. Otherwise, it's an amazing product!"
5.0,5 months ago,Argos,"Stunning sound, not without drawbacks","The sound this speaker is able to produce is shockingly good, most music played through the Homepod will blow you away. If you choose to link 2 up as a stereo pair the sound is more than twice as good. Siri has limitations, but if you’re already an Apple user and you’re looking for sound quality above anything else it’s worth investing in. A word of warning though - bass is strong - you can’t reduce this when playing directly through the speakers, so bear this in mind if you’ve got thin walls..."

Based on my initial impressions for two days, I like it, but I don’t love it. It’s an amazing speaker...it sounds incredible really...but personally I don’t see it as a good value yet. Maybe as I use it more and learn more of its functions I’ll be more impressed. For me...most Apple products have an immediate wow factor and it justifies the price...that didn’t happen for me on this product. Not yet anyway. Luckily I got it on the Black Friday sale so that helps. Apple’s original MSRP price was just a bit optimistic to say the least. Excellent sound, everything is else just ok so for me the jury is still out."

I love the fact that I can have incredible clarity using it as a speakerphone with my iphone. Conference calls have never been so easy or so clear. I'm not sure I would never have bought it if it weren't on sale, but if you've got the money to spend it would be a mistake not to invest in one of these beauties."
2.0,3 weeks ago,John Lewis,Good Speaker but not very functional,"Good quality small speaker but not well integrated into my system. Big problem is that it has removed Apple Music from my SONOS system that I purchased from John Lewis which means I now have only the TV functioning. Also it is fairly ""dumb"" not recognising even simple everyday questions, unlike the Google and Amazon devices which are much more intelligent. I would therefor not recommend this speaker to anyone that has a SONOS sound system"
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,I was waiting for this speaker,"I had one of the old Apple Hi-Fi speakers many years ago and I liked that one. Once Apple announces that they were making the HomePod I was excited to see what it would be like, and the sound is incredible. This little speaker really packs a punch. While the speaker sounds great, it does lack some of the ""smart"" functions that I was hoping for. Siri is lackluster in the speaker right now, however, software is updatable. Apple has already announced that Airplay 2 will be supported later this year, and that's only the tip of the update iceberg that is to come. Siri can easily be updated to get smarter each month. I believe that Apple will be pushing out these updates as they are ready."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,This is what it sounds like when ...,"This speaker is amazing! It may not be the most intuitive smart speaker on the market, but it is the most amazing sounding one! I’m not comparing it to Dolby Atmos or Bose SoundTouch 300, but in its class it plays music the way it’s meant to be enjoyed - loud and immersive. Incredible sound stage and super nice bass. This replaced my Bose SoundLink Revolve Plus. Yes, it’s not perfect and it has limitations, but music reproduction is definitely not one of them! I don’t use Siri much for more than playing my music requests and basic interactions. If I wanted more I’d get a computer, but I wanted an incredible sounding speaker and that’s what I got!"
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Amazing Speaker for Apple Lovers,"I bought this speaker for my daughter. All of her tech is Apple (watch, mac, iPhone, airpods, etc). The sound quality is incredible. We can have it on in one room and hear it from another (without the volume being all the way up). The connection to Apple Music is helpful. She is able to add songs that play directly to her library. Overall, we are still learning everything that we can do with the HomePod, but we love it so far."
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,5th HomePod,"This is my fifth homepod, yes my fifth and I still have the original 4. I love these things, they are absolutely incredible when setup properly. I have two sets of them, each in stereo mode one of in our he master bedroom which is great for controlling our hue lights as well as watching movies and listening music, very high quality fidelity. The others are paired in my Bar, Great for sports & music, etc. these things are fantasticly easy to control easy to use once you get past original Wi-Fi connection process which doesn’t take a lot of brains."
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Awesome speaker,First let me start by saying. If you are looking for a speaker that has great sound quality then this is the speaker for you. It’s loud and the sound quality on it is just amazing! I don’t typically leave reviews but this one item is worth it. Siri plays everything I ask her to. She can hear me from the other room in my home. It stays connected to my phone so even if I get a call I’m able to take it from the speaker its been one of the best investments I’ve made by far!
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Really the best in it's class,"Own the Sonos play 5, and the HomePod blows it away. If you are already in the. Apple ecosystem, this is the way to go. Phone calls on the HomePod work amazingly well. Purchased two of these last year and added another two this year. Have them in almost every room of the house. We play home wide music and can easily control all our smart home devices (lights, locks, etc) with just our voice."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Much more than an excellent speaker,"The HomePod is an excellent speaker, producing some amazing quality sound from a very small form but with Siri it can and does much much more. It functions very well on its own once connected to wifi but it is also possible to link it to an iPhone or and iPad or even Apple TV in which case it produces superb sound for those devices. Setup couldn't be easier, just plug it in and put an iPhone or iPad next to it, two minutes later it's done. Apple has some expanded capabilities coming in the next software update which should be here in a few weeks so it will be possible to use two units to have stereo but frankly the single unit sounds so good am not sure it will matter. I like the ease of use, the great sound quality and the size. I expect I will get another one so I can have one in the living room as well as the bedroom.Less"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Sound in a small beautiful well built body!!,"If you are looking for a perfect companion to fit into your Apple music world you'll loveeeee Apple HomePod. HomePod sounds very good. I was a bit skeptical since I was really happy with my Bose Sound Link Mini II, but after playing few songs the speaker proved what it is capable of. The speaker as expected out of premium Apple product is designed so well that it blends in perfectly & its capability to sense movement and adjust the output to suit the surrounding ensures you get the best sound quality no matter where you place it. Siri is very responsive(no need to shout or yell) and is able to perform majority of the actions(Turn on/off switches/lights, weather forecast, alarm, reminder, etc.) that I used to ask Alexa to do. Go for it if you are looking for a great sounding, beautifully designed, well-built speaker!!Less"
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,"Sounds great, will probably buy a third.",I really like the HomePod primarily because of the quality of the sound it provides and how well it is made. I also have an Echo device in the house and Alexa has more capabilities than Siri at this time but I am seeing encouraging news about future enhancements to the HomePod and some of the services I use. Apple has a lot of room for improvement on the capabilities of Siri via HomePod but it works well with my house's Hue lights and my iTunes library and being able to add things to my grocery list or reminders.
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Great Sound in a Small Size,"By far the best sound in a smart speaker. Despite the size, which is pretty compact, the sound is rich and full. The only issues I have found, is when I compare it to other smart speakers. Currently, Siri is no match (Knowledge wise) to Alexa. Hopefully Apple will continue to improve Siri, but that is not why you buy the speaker. You buy it for the sound quality."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Fantastic start speaker experience,"Disclaimer, I have an Apple Music subscription and currently use an iPhone 11 Pro as well as an older generation iPad Pro. Since I am well invested in the Apple ecosystem, the HomePod integrates nicely into my home and works as expected. One major advantage is that this device now recognizes multiple users and not just myself. My four-year-old daughter can use it without any problems if that tells you anything about the ease of use."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,"Awesome: Apple TV, Visio 2.1 sound bar and HomePod","I have a <$200 sound bar and wanted to make the sound better. After a lot of research, I decided to add HomePod. The results are better than I expected. Using th Apple TV to sync the sound bar and HomePod results in very realistic sound quality. At $200 from Bestbuy, it is the best value at my house this Christmas. Sounds better with music or movies than a friend’s high end Home theater system."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,"Fantastic sound, with a catch","Long story short: you need to be in the Apple ecosystem (including Apple Music) to experience HomePod as intended. Looks/build quality: deceivingly compact, but still feels heavy/solid and very well built as you’d expect from Apple. Sound: While I won’t use the term “audiophile” I certainly enjoy music and technology and my headphone setup runs ~$8,500, so sound quality is important to me. The HomePod is easily the best sound I’ve heard from a single speaker this compact. It is hi-fi? Of course not, it’s a single speaker that’s <7” tall. It has a fun sound signature with impressive bass for such a small form factor. Don’t expect something you’re going to do critical listening on and you’ll be fine. Usage/functionality: I use it in a small home office to have some background music. For this purpose it’s been perfect. I am entrenched in the Apple ecosystem and everything works flawlessly together as you’d expect. I did sign up for Apple Music to use with the HomePod and it has worked great. I am not a big Siri user to begin with, so her current limitations don’t bug me at the present time. Voice activation to manage Apple Music, set timers and reminders, etc is perfectly fine for me. When I’m in the office I’m sitting in front of the computer and don’t need more. I only have a couple of connected devices (video doorbell and a smart lock), so using it as a hub isn’t a major concern for me. The voice detection is amazing. HomePod can hear me from another room in the house. Comparisons: I do have two Echo Dots, one with a Vaux speaker and one with a mokcao power+. The HomePod easily stomps these in terms of sound and build quality, but it should given it’s more than 3x the price. In terms of Siri vs Alexa, they both have their pros and cons. For me it’s basically a wash as far as virtual assistants. Summary: This is an easy recommendation if you’re an iDevice user and an Apple Music subscriber. Outside of that, the cost and walled garden Are barriers to entry.Less"
4.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Get these in pairs.,"This was a second HomePod I added in my home office. One was good, but even though it's got 360-degree output of sound, two work together to really fill the space. These are great for almost everything, but fall a little short for spoken word podcasts. We have a Tivoli Audio M1BTSLC Model One Bluetooth radio in my wife's study, and going from one room to another voices are clearer on the Tivoli. That said, for ease of use and overall music playing, we're very pleased."
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Excellent Audio for Music,"There other smart speakers available. Depending on your application, and budget if the HomePod is right for you. Apple used the extra cost in price on its device in sound quality. If you already have apple products you can use your calendar, reminder, and notes it can do those tasks, but anything more complex than that like purchasing things from Amazon. You may want to add an Amazon Dot. The build quality and sound stage is excellent nothing else comes close in sound on the same form factor. It will stream your itunes library or you can you use airplay to stream other sources that's compatible. A great product that will probably improve in time."
5.0,a year ago,bestbuy.ca,Great sound in a small package,"I really love the HomePod. The sound quality is quite impressive for such a small speaker. I used it to replace a very nice tower speaker setup. Of course the sound quality isnâ€™t as good as a traditional speaker and amp setup, but it takes up way less room and is much easier to control. Siri is very responsive and does most of what I need a smart assistant to do. Siri controls music very well, plays the news, gives weather reports and controls my smart home devices. Itâ€™s not as good as Google Assistant for looking up random information, but thatâ€™s pretty low on my list of needs. Iâ€™m planning to add more HomePods to my house soon."
4.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Apple fine tuned,"This was a bit of an enigma when it showed up. Having Echo (and Alexa) in the house since two xmass ago, I was a bit confounded by what the Homepod offered and provided. It, as previously reviewed many times, sounds great, and is worth the purchase price, just for a wireless streaming speaker! I wish the Siri interaction provided more than just accessing (a paid subscription) to Apple Music...... I do not have a subscription to this and was a bit flummoxed by not being able to access my Music Library by voice!? But once I adjusted to what it is, and what it does, I do think it is an excellent addition to the wireless household -- even though it does not allow my refridgerator to talk to my toaster or turn my bedroom lights on and off-- Now I just need a couple more to sync up for stereo and full house coverage!Less"
4.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Good but could improve,"This review has two parts. 1. B&H was great! Wonderful price and delivery. Ive purchased items before from them and have always been more than satisfied. Now for 2. The HomePods sound cant be matched from the other devices out there. However it is very limited in its Hey Siri functions. Ive been using Amazon Echo (1st Gen) and it has grown into and information powerhouse with what it can deliver, but the HomePods Hey Siri is nowhere close to matching the functionality of Amazons Echo. If you want a great sounding music player with some other functions then HomePod is your pick. Hopefully Apple will improve the Hey Siri function as time goes on."
5.0,10 months ago,Argos,Best Smart Speaker,I used to have the Amazon Echo but I always found the sound quality just wasn't up to scratch for me so I bought my original HomePod last Christmas (2018) and was blown away by the sound quality. The bass on these little devices is 2nd to non and the overall quality of the sound is truly breathtaking. I recently purchased a 2nd HomePod for the Kitchen and yet again it is the best investment ever. Siri is just as good as Alexa so don't let negative reviews of the Smart aspect put you off.
5.0,a month ago,ebay.com,Hardware is great!,"Works as advertised. Bass goes deeper than my HK Go Play (cant get nearly as loud though). It sounds absolutely phenomenal at all volume levels and the bass shines through at low to mid levels. Siri isnt as intelligent as my friends google smart speaker, but that can be changed with future software updates. Apple nailed the hardware with this one. Good investment."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Outstanding speaker,I have HomePods and in multiple rooms. I also have two as a stereo pair and they are incredible sounding. Siri works good but it is a bit limited at the moment. I expect this to change in the near future as Apple will probably expand it’s capabilities. Very happy with the product. Bought these at the $200 price point last year and this year during Christmas. Could not be happier!
5.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,"Sound great, even better as a stereo pair","I bought one of these to listen to music and use with my apple tv. It sounded great, nice bass and sounds better than my wireless bose. I just bought a second one and use them as a stereo pair and WOW they sound even better. Siri seems to be able to understand all my commands, even quiet commands from across the room. They are plenty loud enough for me and better yet with no distortion."
5.0,10 months ago,massgenie.com,Sounds Really Good,"First HomePod, previously had the big Jambox. HomePod sounds much better, base is much deeper and louder. Used airplay to play music from Iphone/Ipad music library or youtube. Highly recommended. Siri also works fine, you don't need to yell for it to listen to you while music is playing. The only minor thing is that this doesn't have a built-in battery, so not easily movable and cannot be brought to picnic, etc."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,HomePod,"I first bought a HomePod when they came out back in February. I ended up returning it due to lack of justification of cost for yet another speaker in the house. I am not concerned about the smart features as much as sound quality. I was amazed at the sq then as I am today. I just bought one again because I found myself missing it a lot, and also had a hefty trade in value to gift card from an iPhone. The size and sound, convenience of playing my Apple Music subscription through it is great. The house is full of Apple products so that’s no issue and I love airplay2 and seems reliable. If sound quality and Apple Music are your thing, I highly recommend."
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Could be better if Apple fixes the software,"Continuously dropped AirPlay connections when playing from other iOS devices; I never had these problems with BlueTooth speakers. AirPlay from a Mac works much better, from an AppleTV is worse (the AppleTV always forgets what device to play audio to). These are software problems that will hopefully eventually get fixed. What's not fixable: there's no AUX input and no Bluetooth connectivity, i.e., with non-Apple devices or legacy audio equipment, these speakers are useless. Not what you would hope for with such expensive speakers. The sound is okay, but for this money you can probably get better sound elsewhere."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Apple HomePod,"I would consider myself an audiophile. I love music, and above average high quality speakers. I bought the HomePod with the intention of just returning it due to lack of satisfaction. I have owned many different wireless speakers, none of them completely satisfied my taste. I like a wireless speaker to be compact, play loud and clear. The HomePod sounds big, very clear and has a lot of bass. Given my intended use for it, playing music while multitasking around the house or garage, it delivers the type of sound I was looking for, easily heard in other rooms, nothing sounds left out of any genre I play, I also can control the volume and songs playing from on my Apple Watch. I find it pretty basic for smart home features in comparison to amazon Alexa. If you are in the Apple ecosystem and want a sound quality foremost smart speaker, this is for you. To save yourself time, delete the HomeKit app and re download it to start, as that was my setup issue, also make sure you are holding your iPhone right over the top of speaker to bring up paring process. I have no complaints so far and definitely can’t ask for more from the sound quality it delivers.Less"
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Great music and perfect for Homekit Ecosystem,"I love this product. I have a bunch of Homekit devices, google home and Alexa products, but all said and done a huge fan of Apple devices. Setup was super easy, siri does a good job with understanding my commands and gives me crisp responses unlike Alexa and google. Love the idea of airplay with devices which support airplay. just with one command I can play music in the entire house and great audio quality."
5.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Great sound and easy to use hub for smart home,"We recently moved into a new home and decided to add some “smart home” features. We researched a number of smart home hubs and landed on the Apple HomePod. First, as a speaker, it has amazing full sound and has flexibility in sound set up using the equalizer native in the Apple settings menu of our phones. Functioning as a hub, it’s very easy to configure and is comparable with a large number of accessories."
5.0,a year ago,ao.com,"The HomePod is a fantastic speaker. Easy set up. No need to calibrate, it makes sure every song sounds fantastic. The microphones are unbelievable. Can hear you talk to the speaker from the other side of the room with loud music playing with no need to shout. Unfortunately the only downfall is the “Smart” part of the speaker. Siri isn’t the most capable virtual assistant but that can easily be changed in the future with a software update. Still, Siri is able to play songs on demand, set a timer, control smart lights etc and answer simple questions which are the main things people want a smart speaker for.","The HomePod is a fantastic speaker.

5.0,a year ago,Appliances Direct,Stephen's review of Apple HomePod,"Pros: I’ll be honest and admit from the outset that I’m an Apple fan. When the HomePod first became available I was intrigued but had an alternative already, so didn’t pursue. When Apple software updated to allow pairing of HomePods, I couldn’t resist any longer. I bought one first, to see how good that would be. I was sold and within hours I ordered a second. The sound is magnificent, especially in something so comparatively small. Siri is fantastic. Hears my voice easily. I even use to play films etc via Apple TV, so, like a mini Home cinema system. Magnificent! Cons: No bad points. If you are pondering whether or not to purchase, don’t, buy two, life’s too short."
4.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Great speaker. Easy to connect.,The sound quality is very good and the connection to WiFi was very simple. I have since connected numerous smart devices and all were very simple connections. If I had one criticism I would say I wish the volume at top end was a bit higher but not a deal breaker at all. Love the Apple products and this is another product that I would recommend. I chose this over the competitors because of the privacy as well.
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Brought music to our life,"Got this for our kitchen and paired with my wife’s iPhone with Apple Music. The kids ask Siri to play Disney songs and voila, music! Great sound, content accessible even when a phone isn’t around, useful for adding reminders, calendar events and kitchen timers hands free. My only annoyance was the long cord. Initially I wrapped it around the base, but then built a hollow base that the extra cord could be stored in."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Can’t replace my current stereo system,"I was hoping that the HomePod would be sufficient to replace my office stereo system, but it’s not. I would need to purchase two Homepods for that. The sound quality of the HomePod is good, but since it’s only one unit, the sound doesn’t have the range I would like. I do like the Siri commands for the HemePod, such as the ability to play and pause songs and issuing commands to a few of my Wemo connected devices via HomeKit. There are several other commands I need to try and get accustomed to using such as for quick calculation. Maybe when I save enough money, I might consider buying another one, because I much rather have two wireless speakers, the wired stereo setup that I’ve been using for years."
2.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great Sound; Limited Functions,"Pros: - Sound quality is great; far superior to my existing Echo. - Product feels high quality, all the way down to the fabric textured power cable. I’d have been upset if this came with the generic Apple plastic white cable that inevitably gets dingy/yellow and begins to fray. - You can use other music services outside of Apple Music (via AirPlay), just not natively. I’d prefer natively, but listing this as a pro because I have seen some misleading posts saying services like Spotify cannot be used at all. That is incorrect. Cons (most regard it severely lacking as a smart speaker): - Cannot set multiple timers. Especially when cooking, I’ll often have multiple timers going on my Echo. - Inability to recognize different people. This one is especially annoying if you want to be able to receive/send calls or texts through the HomePod. The speaker is linked to my phone. Even if I’m not around, anyone with access to the speaker can send or receive messages from me (if the option is enabled), despite the fact they are not me. My options are to either disable the feature entirely, or be aware that anyone (friend or family) who is near the HomePod, would have unfettered access to my messages/calls. - Siri in general is lacking. For instance, if I ask Siri if it is going to rain, all I get is a “yes” or a “no”. If I ask Alexa the same thing, I get a percentage chance of rain and expected amounts. Several other instances, but just one example. - No ability to use other music services (i.e. Spotify, Tidal, etc.) natively with the device. As listed above, it is doable through AirPlay, but this comes at the cost of more in depth voice commands. - Was foolishly hoping the Nest would become HomeKit compatible since Apple made HomeKit authorization digital now (no longer requires physical hardware). That is not the case. Another thing to keep in mind, Apple’s control over smart home items is limited to HomeKit devices. More may come soon with recent changes to HomeKit, but if you have anything from Google (like the Nest) don’t get your hopes up and factor into your purchase decision. Conclusion: Overall, the speaker is great, for a speaker. As an introduction to a smart speaker? Not so much. I would only recommend this (currently) to users who are subscribers to Apple Music, primarily use Apple mobile devices, and who have HomeKit enabled devices. Many of my complaints can be resolved via over the air software updates. However, I’d say don’t buy and wait for that to happen, wait for that to happen and THEN buy. Apple is far less likely to address these complaints if they get solid sales of the device out the door."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,I love my home pod,"My fiancé bought it for me for Christmas last year, then stole it for herself. I bought another to put my office and I love it. Siri hears everything, it’s loud enough to satisfy my needs to crank certain songs up. These are excellent purchases since now we have two. Much like other smart speaker devices they link together and can play great sound throughout the house. I’m thinking of buying a third one..."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,"Great sound, but software lacks","The HomePod is a great for anyone that hasn't bought a smart speaker, is already heavily into the Apple ecosystem, and is a subscriber to Apple Music. The HomePod's sound is amazing at all levels of volume. While this is small, that does not mean it has poor sound quality. The sound quality is amazing!the sound quality is better than any smart speaker currently available. The vocals are clear, the bass great. The HomePod has one bass, 7 tweeter speakers, and 6 microphones. the ""Hey Siri"" feature is amazing, and the microphones pick up the command very well, even when I'm sitting 20 feet away, and speaking in a soft tone at my iPhone, the HomePod picks up the command instead. The HomePod's microphones work, even at 100% volume which is very loud, the ""Hey Siri command is picked up. Siri isn't the greatest digital assistant, but this can improve in future software updates. Siri also can't differentiate between different voices on the HomePod like it can on the iPhone. So anyone that's near the HomePod and says ""Hey Siri"" will trigger Siri.Less"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Amazing piece of tech amd boom,"This was a surprise Christmas present. We are using it for weather, time checks for school, some music playback and general voice command generated question and answer situations. The sound quality is very rich and bassy.

I have had no issues with Siri at all and she works great with my smart home setup as everything in our house is both homekit and alexa enabled. I think the retail price is a little too much for it, but getting it on sale for Black Friday I felt the value was definitely there."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Sound,Had been given the original Echo as a gift and used it largely to play music in my bedroom. My wife asked to use it this Christmas downstairs to play holiday music. She got hooked on the timer capability and asked to keep it down there. Was reluctant to buy a HomePod as I listen to Pandora frequently and didn't want to be bothered with Apple Play. Bought one anyway when it went on sale at Best Buy for $100 off. Absolutely blows away the Echo in terms of sound...really nice bass and crisp acoustics. Found that Apple Music fit my needs when I did a bit of exploring. Great purchase. Would recommend.
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,AMAZING!!!!,"This product meets every expectation I have for sound built and sound quality. I seriously cant stop listening to it. Many people are leaving not so good reviews and truthfully I don't understand why. This is a new venture for apple. The tweeter hight tones and bass is so pure and just amazing for something so small. Every corner you put this speaker in the sound kicks you in the face with awesomeness. Ok now the hookup process. Plugged it in and I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to make it work lol because Im thinking old school bluetooth. You have to think beyond that just like many Apple products. This is not your typical speakers and it works on a different level and I love it unlike some other people. Once connected does not loose connection when you leave the room with your phone. You can either sync it with your phone and play music or just say Siri, play Sinatra and it will play Sinatra music radio. Its a little confusing in the beginning but just like the no home button the iPhone X 2 or 3 times and your GOOD TO GO! The mics are amazing. You can almost whisper hey Siri an it picks up. Tell Siri to make it quieter louder. Change songs lookup songs and so on. This is a different speaker then any other for a different purpose that works well with Apple product so expect something different. Im a Bose enthusiast and let me say the Homepod sounds is truly remarkable for the size and in my opinion beats some of Bose speakers that ranges from $350-700 price range. It is HEAVY! and thats another way you can tell on the built quality. Good speakers, woofers are always heavy due to the magnets being larger. I cant wait for them to release the update so I can hookup two fo them. Absolutely remarkable sound.I LOVE THIS THING and recommend it 100%!!Less"
5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Music to my ears!,"Just got my 4th HomePod so finally have stereo pairs in both my sitting room and bedroom. They are linked to my MacBook, iPhone, iPad and Apple TV all via the Home app and work together or separately almost seamlessly. For film / TV the speakers produce really good crisp sound and, whilst they don't (quite) match a cinema surround d system, they are not far off. For music they are in a class of their own. The range is fantastic, high notes and voices are crisp and clear and the bass tones add real depth. I bought one direct from Apple at full price and the remaining three (boxed / sealed / new) on ebay, saving between 60-80 per unit - the latter being a more realistic price/value in my opinion. Thoroughly recommended."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Amazing Sound!,"I bought this after many reviews. Really curious on how good the speaker really is. Decided to just try it out and return it since I’m an elite member, I have 30 days.... but... after just 2 days, I decided to keep it because the speaker is amazing. Apple delivers on the speaker with “smart speaker feature” as a bonus. I say this because first and foremost this is a premium speaker system. This speaker is crystal clear when it comes to sound. Bass is absolutely amazing as it doesn’t crack at all, even at 100%. I can’t wait until Apple add 2 speakers Airplay. Siri can hear you even with the speaker at full blast without you shouting commands."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Best Wireless Speaker,"I have the Sonos Play:1,3,5 in my house currently and they don’t have the same crisp quality as the HomePod. I was surprised and not really looking at purchasing it until I read some reviews. At home it’s is very loud and has no issues with low mid and high points at any volume. The Siri assistant is just like the phone can answer basic “Siri stuff” so it’s not Alexa but that’s good for me since I have an Alexa and haven’t used it as much as I thought I would. When the AirPlay 2 comes out this year you’ll be able to group together the speakers and have an options for stereo pairs but for right now it’s great. My favorite thing though is being able to finally AirPlay from my phone or computer without opening an app. If I want to show someone a video or song from anywhere on my phone you just select the HomePod as the output and it goes right to the speaker. Sonos I couldn’t play any sound from my devices to the speaker you always have to use what’s in the app. Lastly Siri can hear you over any volume you have it at with a normal speaking voice. 100% volume and the living room is filled with crisp music and deep base (for the device size and price) just saying “Hey Siri” she will volume down and wait for an input with no effort of raising your voice.Less"
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Sounds great, but otherwise troublesome","I’m very impressed with the sound. It sounds like a subwoofer is attached, producing rich, clean bass. However, since I hooked it up, I’ve been having a problem keeping it connected to the internet. I have a powerful router and it’s not that far away, and other other items in the room, such as my iPad, have no problem maintaining connection. But at least a couple of times a day, I will ask Siri something and it will say “working on it” and finally “I’m having trouble connecting to the internet.” Also, very disappointed in how few smart items the HomePod Control. I’ve kept my Echo because it controls my entertainment system and Dyson fan, and the HomePod does not have that capability."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,For Apple enthusiasts!,"The HomePod is something really special that will expand its options as updates come available over time. The sound on this impeccable piece of engineering is absolutely INCREDIBLE. I’m a audiophile at heart. I have to have the best of the best when it comes to sound. This has 7-speakers that offer crisp and clear keynotes that can make you hear things that you normally couldn’t in the smart speaker world. I also have a Sonos and believe me when I say this that the sound comparison between the Apple’s HomePod and the Sony’s Sonos has a marginal gap. I was blown away by how impressive the HomePod sounds. The microphone also has pretty good range. I was 3 rooms away and Siri picked up what I said (with kids running in the background) and played 80s Rock. That was impressive for a small but heavy speaker. Speaking of heavy. That is due to the magnet that is in this speaker. The bass that comes from this thing is MIGHTY impressive. I’ve had friends come over during the weekend and they never guessed it was coming from the HomePod. They thought it was my Bose Home Theatre system that I usually have on. Needless to say they were blown away as it knows where it’s sitting by using sound waves reporting back to the device so that’ll it’ll adjust to any room setting. On another note. This is is limited for now. If you don’t think Apple won’t open the HomePod up to other apps and add new features then you obviously don’t know Apple. For now if you can be a little patient until Apple releases updates this year and can just admire the sound quality the HomePod has then its for you. It’ll eventually be able to connect to other devices within time. Everyone just has to be patient. That shouldn’t stop anyone from buying a speaker to listen to music via Apple Music, iTunes and Spotify. Overall, The HomePod is an incredible sounding machine. Apple spent 6 years in development to get the sound perfect and they did just that. Now they will focus on updates throughout the year to improve what’s already THE best sounding device in my home. Go get one especially if you’ve invested in iTunes, Spotify and Apple Music!!Less"
2.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Wouldn’t update,Received one as a Christmas present. Came with iOS 13.2.1 in the system. The HomePod wouldn’t control the lights or send texts or phone call that are listed in my phonebook. It did play music. Loved the sound. Called Apple support. After 3 hard system restarts to bring it back to factory settings it wouldn’t update to the latest iOS of 13.3. There suggestion was to take it back. So I did.
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Hey Siri you’re awesome,"One of the best products we have purchased. It’s so much more than “just” a speaker. We are trying to make our house a smart house while only using Apple Apple products or compatible with Apple HomeKit. HomePod is the brain to our smart house. It controls the garage door, lights, temperature etc. It works perfect. And also acts like a great speaker"
4.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Superior sound quality compared to other smart speakers,"This little guy sounds big and more balanced than other smart speakers we have. We have Google and Amazon products. I would not grade it as an audiophile grade as many others have done, however. One thing that Apple falls short is Siri is not good at speech recognition compared to Amazon Alexa and Google. Thats a shame because searching for Apples iTunes music is a lot harder than it should be. I wish there was a way to find music on iPhone and have HomePod play it seamlessly. This would solve HomePods poor speech recognition issue. This is the only reason why it does not get a 5-star rating."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,great sound. decent functionality.,"right off the bat: it is locked into apple music. it sounds pretty good, which is a positive. it syncs up well with airplay enabled devices. it plays well with apple TV (no noticable delay) and with apple's iphones. when you airplay to it from your iphone however using say, spotify, there is an annoying delay (about three seconds in some instances). you hit play... silence... two seconds later, music plays. same with pause. harsh reality is it seems to only do that with spotify on my iphone. otherwise, you can set alarms, reminders, ask for basic information and siri responds well. lots of room for improvement but i feel like i got a good product after a couple of months of using it daily. works very well with apple homekit."
5.0,a year ago,Target,"I have been waiting to get this since it came out. I had not seen or heard it in person. I ordered online last week and I have to say that it exceeded my expectations. It is much bigger than I thought but the perfect size for a speaker. The set up was simple and took less than a minute. The sound and power of this speaker is unbelievable. I am so impressed!! I have a portable wireless Bose speaker and own Sonos as well. This is by far the best sound I have ever heard. I had no idea that you can add accessories to control lights, alarms, doorbell, garage door, temperature etc for your home. I will definitely be adding some of those over time. The only pro is that it is not wireless which would be a great feature. It plugs in but the pro is that you don't have to worry about it running out after 4-6 hours. My Bose is so old that is only last 2-3 hours now.Less","I have been waiting to get this since it came out. I had not seen or heard it in person.

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,All about the sound....,"I didn't even want a HomePod but I walked by the display at Best Buy and was blown away by the quality of the sound. There is no other small speaker on the market that puts out the bass and also quality highs and mids that this little speaker hammers out.. No it's not portable and no it's not that cross compatible with other music services.. but wow it sounds so good. I hear a rumor that apple is developing a way to tie 2 together for stereo sound... I'll be back for another for sure... No 2 speakers out there will be able to crank out that much quality sound in such a small set of speakers. My Spotify still plays well, but just not much help from Siri.. but who needs her. 2 Thumbs way up"
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Love it,"Love this speaker so much that I bought 2. One for the home bedroom and one for my office. Great great sound quality. Syncs with your phone if you want it too. Can play all your music on the phone or with Apple Music if you have that subscription. Never need to set an alarm on your phone again... you just need to tell your speaker to wake you up in the morning. Its an expensive speaker, but you get what you pay for. I love it."
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Love em,"I live in a condo complex, so it’s a bit challenging to find the balance between decent sound and pounding bass that will make the neighbors angry. These seem to achieve that balance. I have 2 of them set up as a stereo pair, they sound great and I haven’t heard any complaints from the adjacent units! I do use these at a pretty reasonable (low) sound level though, so don’t think that you can crank up the volume with the same results, I definitely COULD make the sound heard by my neighbors.."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Stunning sound,"Ordered first HomePod for pickup on launch day. Very easy to setup(stop the it doesn't work for Android BS who caresApple has 1.3 Billion iOS devices they will be fine). Once up and running you will be blown away by how good this speaker sounds. I already bought 2 more. And whats really amazing you only have to whisper ""hey siri"" and she comes alive. And with the music at 100% which is plenty loud with ZERO distortion she hears every time what you ask. So say your playing your favorite tunes and its loud you can ask her ""hey siri hows the traffic on the way to work today?"" She quiets the music and tells you. The goes right back to playing your songs. You can mid song ask ""Who is this playing?"" and when she passes and tells you say ""i like it"" she will say ""got it: and them remember what you like for the future. So when you say ""play something I like"" it will show up. Another cool option is you can turn off the siri sound (in options, think it comes off by default) and then when you ask ""hey siri"" and pause she comes on and say things like ""uh huh""? But you can just say ""hey siri whats the latest news (with no pause) and it works perfect. Is there a few things they need to work on software and siri(and of course will) yes, but nothing that won't make it better. And for those that complain it can't do Spotify? Well yes you can airplay from your phone and it works fine. Much prefer Apple Music since its fully baked into iOS. Well worth every penny so don't listen to the naysayers who can't afford it.Less"
5.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Great sound!,"If you are looking for a device that Airplay and sounds great, then this is it! Apple has created a speaker that sounds great, looks great and it's very easy to set up The good: Looks great, Sounds Great, Has Siri (could go any way with that) NIce look The bad: A lot of the home devices must be designed with Apple ID number to set up. Google home has more apps and its smarter than Siri Overall: If you want airplay very easy then this is it, Great sound! Siri needs improvement if they want to compete in the Home business"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great speaker but you have to like Apple,"The HomePod speaker is fantastic, and even more amazing when you combine two together for stereo. What I like with the Home Pod vs the Sonos is that the bass is impressive. It's like there's a subwoofer in this tiny speaker. There are some not great things though : first the speakers are NOT bluetooth. Second, you better use Apple Music as your way to play music. Yes you can use spotify, etc, but it must be used through your iphone...no iphone, no audio from homepod speakers. So to recap: you better be in the Apple world to really appreciate this speaker..but if you are...wow."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Multiple HomePods are a great purchase,"I now have three HomePods, and it really makes a difference in how frequently I use them. When I only had one, it was something I used while cooking or eating. Now that I have them in the living room and master bathroom, I can pretty much go my entire morning listening to the same album or playlist from room to room. Having AppleMusic makes a huge difference in ease of use, but it's not mandatory."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Incredible Sound!,"Yes, Siri is not as fully featured as it should be. Never mind that, it’s all about the sound. I tested this in multiple rooms with multiple types of music and once it adjusts itself to the size of the room, it’s on! With the multiple speakers it does present you with a “pseudo” stereo image, actually it’s like a L, R, Center (vocals), out of one device. Set it as the output of the Apple TV 4K and my ears could not discern exactly where the “pseudo” surround sound was coming from while watching a movie. Bottom line, if you need to speak to an inanimate object for information, use Siri on a different iOS device. If you want an incredible sounding speaker, buy a HomePod."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Excellent for the iOS ecosystem!,"Bought it for my bedroom for the ease of connectivity from iPhone and iPad, and it indeed produces a wonderful audio range. Was pleasantly surprised how easy it is to connect to my AppleTV, and it provides a much better and richer sound than the TV itself. If I manage to find it at the pre-Christmas price again, I may buy another one, as I’ve now learned they can be setup to work together to produce true stereo effect. Will update my review if/when I do that."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Excellent balanced sound,"You won’t be disappointed. First, you can play content from any music service using AirPlay. Second, the sound is very refined and in my opinion better than Bose or Sonos. It totally blows away an Alexa speaker. Third, with AirPlay 2 and in stereo mode (if you get two) the sound is amazing. The sound is comparable to audiophile quality systems - I am saying this as some who has KEF bookshelf’s in my office and the HomePods match them if not better. Net, if you care about great audio quality in a small package, this is the best system right now. I have no problems with Siri on HomePod. It works..."
5.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Absolutely amazing sound! Siri is great too.,"Purchased this from JL as Apple had a delayed date on shipping, and they also include a 2 year guarantee. Received the next day and my word, it's the best speaker out there, beats the likes of Sonos! Siri can hear you whilst the music is blasting full power even if requested softly and quietly. If you're an audiophile, I strongly recommend you purchasing one of these. It's clever how it can sense where it is placed and change the way it plays the music out the opposite direction if up against a wall. Was a bit hesitant at first on the value of the product, but reading the reviews later, I agree with all of them, nice one Apple."
4.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,I expected more from Apple.,"I have a 4K Apple TV, iPhone 10, new iPad and Apple Watch. Siri gets confused between them. Most frustrating is when I tell Siri to turn a light on. HomePod and my phone both say OK and the light turns on and then back off. Sound quality also a little less impressive than I expected - lacking in both max volume and bass punch. On the flip side, if I use my phone and apps, I do have a lot of flexibility over music in the hours and where it plays."
4.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Best Sounding Smart Speaker,"As a speaker this exceeds expectation and is better than any Bose Bluetooth Speaker I have owned/used. I own 2 now. Siri is okay, but that is not why I purchased it. I loses 1 star because there is no way to adjust the EQ. The little speaker has too much bass for the early morning hours. I end up turning down the volume, but then it is almost inaudible at any distance greater then 10 feet."
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Perfect For The Apple Ecosystem!,"Now this is my third I have in my home. It controls my Air conditioner and heat, my music in every room in my room, my lights, and more making it the ultimate home system. Sound quality is the best. At its price point, I can honestly say, if you’re not a fan of Apple products and don’t at least have two, I wouldn’t buy this. You also need Apple Music membership to stream music from it at its full potential. So keep this in mind please"
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,A real quality of sound from a real loudspeaker,"This unit was purchased to have music in the parts of the house where there was no existing sound system nor appropriate space to place one, such as the kitchen / breakfast area. The sound is amazingly deep and close to Hi-Fi quality for a single speaker, and it fits into my Apple-based distributed sound system across the whole house, becoming just one additional device on which music can be played from either an iPhone or iPad, or from the iTunes app on one of the computers. It is not small but neither is it obtrusive. It can be controlled directly using the tactile controls on the top, or from the device playing through it. Not cheap but definitely worth every penny."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Wow!,"The HomePod is a great little device! My wife and I were commenting how stereo systems have changed over the years, and, well, just Wow! The sound is excellent with crisp, clear clarity. We are Apple product users all the way with several devices. I also have an Apple Music subscription along with iTunes Match, so the HomePod just makes sense for us. I've had no problems with the white circle mark underneath either. This is our first Smart Speaker as I was slow to the party. I'm glad I waited for the Apple HomePod! I believe the shortcomings that have been mentioned with Siri will be addressed with software updates. I highly recommend!"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,It Packs a Punch,"Practically got this for half price with black Friday deals and credit from Best Buy. At first I thought it wasn’t worth the price, but after using it for a while, for its size the volume and clarity this provides is amazing. The fact that it is always updating to ensure even playback is an amazing algorithm, not to mention the fact that “Hey, Siri” can hear you even over loud music. Definitely will purchase more for other rooms and stereo pairing. Airplay 2 is hands down the best. I can now tell my Apple TV to play audio on my HomePod and vice-versa, so I can have full audio playing throughout my place without missing a beat."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,HomePod Excellence,"Coming from owning multiple speakers, Google, Alexa, etc. HomePod is definitely in the same ball park! Great Sound, great Integration! Only con I’d say is that Siri could use a big upgrade in other ways compared to the competition Alexa. Very good looking design and overall an Apple product for Apple Enthusiasts and more to enjoy!"
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Excellent sound quality,"I have a HomePod and ended up buying one for my SO. He loves it and it’s so easy to use with smart home accessories such as Philips Hue lights.

Love it!"
5.0,8 months ago,samsclub.com,HomePod & HomeKit,We have created an Apple HomeKit based smart home and we primarily purchased the HomePod to accept Siri commands to control our home. The microphones do a much better job at picking up our commands over our iPhones or iPads. The HomePod also has great sound and we do use it to play music. We like the fact that we can remotely have it turn on and off while away from home for a little added security.
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,My wife and I love our HomePods,"The Apple HomePod does everything we need it to do. I have one in the home office and one in the living room. I like that I can asked Sir in my office to play the same music that is playing in the Living room and it will sync up and play the same music. I also like that I can pair them up for Stereo and have one as the Left channel and the other as the Right channel. We get news updates, sports, etc. Plus home automation with devices that support Homekit."
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Sounds Amazing,"Just like all of the other reviews state, this speaker sounds amazing. I had a small google speaker before this one, I wanted something that would utilize my apple music subscription without using Bluetooth on my phone. The Apple Homepod sounds amazing! It really does, almost worried its too much for my apartment as I don't want the neighbors to be upset with how much bass this speaker has even at low volumes."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Little Pod, Big Sound","I told myself I was not going to splurge on this little new device from Apple, but since I have an Apple Music subscription and love listening to music, I couldn’t resist. I’m very glad that I did! The sound is as good as the critics say. My impression is that the HomePod separates each ‘layer’ of the song into vocals and invdividual instruments, making each sound its absolute best. I have a BOSE speaker that just doesn’t come close in terms of sound quality without distortion when increasing volume. Overall, I’m highly pleased with the purchase. I personally do not mind the limitations with Siri; I knew that Siri still needs work when I made the purchase."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Literally shocked by the sound,"I'm a person who doesn't use a smart light, a smart home electronics so to me the speaker aspect of it is really worth it. The HomePod is definitely one of the best purchases I've made this year. It has such an outstanding sound quality with just one in the room. I did a test to see how loud this speaker is so I put it on 75% volume, closed my bedroom and walked around the house and I could still hear it from upstair and downstairs. The con with this device is it has difficulty recognizing classical music. Siri just butchers some of the classical and when you try to repeat it in the way Siri does, it won't be able to play that piece of music so you have to manually play the song in via iTunes or from your Apple device."
3.0,a year ago,very.co.uk,Great sound. Lacking features,"The sound from such a small speaker is fantastic, better quality than other similar sized speakers I have owned. The functionality that was advertised by Apple when this was announced in 2017 is still not available. It’s works great with Apple Music and Siri, it’s not yet possible to make a multi room system with this, it’s also not possible to set up 2 of these as stereo speakers. It’s not possible to play internet radio stations other than those provided directly by Apple. (No BBC, Capital, Magic etc). Features therefore are nowhere near those provided by Amazon and Google, but can’t be beaten for a single speaker Apple subscription based setup for the quality."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,I own 6 and will by more. What does that tell you?,"I purchased two Apple HomePods in early November taking advantage of Best Buy's ""Pre-Black Friday"" sale. I was blown away by the sound quality, SIRI performance and ease of integrating into my Apple eco system. When Black Friday came around I purchased four more taking advantage of the sale pricing. I will. be in the market for more the next time they go on sale. What does that tell you?"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great for HomeKit Hub,"While I will typically jump on the Apple product bandwagon no matter what the item is, I was a little leery of getting the HomePod when it originally was released. The price was high and it just didn't make sense to me that I needed something like this since I had other Bluetooth speakers. I started having problems with my Apple HomeKit items so I ended up getting this HomePod for the purpose of using it as a hub. It has worked perfectly well for this purpose and it's been great when we've had people over at our house, too. I can't recommend the HomePod enough. The speaker is top notch and the HomePod has not failed once in controlling our HomeKit products."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Amazing Sound,"Amazing sound, renders good treble and bass, evenly distributing volume throughout whichever room it’s placed in. Siri’s accuracy is better than fair, but not the best in recognizing commands, in my experience. Paired with another HomePod, gives mind blowing results. Throw in the TV’s speaker, and it’s a no—no. Does not work with PlayStation 4."
2.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,0013134938,"I love Apple products!!! But, I’ve done a comparison side by side of the Home Pod and the Bose Soundlink Resolve Plus, as well as the Bose Soundlink Mini II. Both of the Bose portable speakers easily outperformed the Apple Home Pod. The Home Pod bass sounded “boomy” while the Bose products sound deep and no boominess. The Bose speakers had more volume and cleaner crisper sound. And they are cheaper than Home Pod. Home Pod is designed to work only with Apple Music. However, Apple Music works with the Bose Speakers just as well, and Siri commands work well with Bose, using your Apple devices linked to the Bose speakers via Bluetooth. Home Pod is overpriced for the quality you get. You are better off to use your Apple device (iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Mac Book, etc) paired with the Bose Soundlink Resolve or Bose Soundlink Mini II. And the Bose speakers are wireless and play for 12 to 16 hours before needing recharged. The Home Pod is not portable. It operates via a 110V power cord. I’d wait for a future version of Home Pod that’s wireless and with improved sound quality.Less"
4.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Very good but don’t expect excellence.,"The speaker is easy to setup and sounds impressive. I have one HomePod but presume that if I had two they would sound exceptional. I use sonos speakers as well and in my estimation, the HomePod sounds better for the form factor. I also like using Apple Music rather than the sonos app. If you want convenience and aren’t expecting high end audio, the HomePod won’t let you down."
5.0,a year ago,John Lewis,HomePod is fantastic,"HomePod produces incredible sound with amazing bass response for such a little unit. I bought it to play iTunes from my iPad and iPhone which it does perfectly. I did have to get Apple support to help me ensure that the iPad and HomePod were on the same frequency all the time – Apple support is awesome and it cost me nothing. I didn’t buy HomePod to talk to Seri but she can be fun. I once swore at her because I was not getting the right answer and she replied “I will not dignify that remark with a response” – brilliant! HomePod is not cheap, but if you want incredible sounds from your iPad, you should get it. Radio is also easy to play back from iPad with an app."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great sound and easy to use,"The Apple HomePod’s two strongest features are the ease of setting it up (just hold your iPhone near it and tell it that you do want to set up the HomePod) and the quality of the sound. I have an expensive surround system in the same room and actually prefer how music sounds on the HomePod. This is probably the cleanest sounding speaker that I have ever heard. I have only set up one Home device (a Wemo outlet switch that controls a light), but that almost set itself up, it was so easy. Works great! Siri is also helpful in finding nearby stores, etc., playing news summaries, and providing other information."
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Buy 2 HomePods if you can,"To enjoy the sound, you must buy 2 HomePods and set up both HomePods as stereo pair. Setup is very easy with your iPhone. WIFI is required to use HomePods. I airplay music from either my iPhone SE or iPhone X to HomePods. I do not use Apple Music to streamline music from internet to my HomePods. I do not use SIRI much for my HomePods, strictly use for listening music. The only negative is I cannot adjust the sound balance ( left or right channel ) for my stereo pair HomePods. Otherwise, excellent sound and cute."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Wonderful gift,"I got this for Christmas this year. I was at first a little sceptical but found out a few things. First, it is very easy to use. Simply plug it in and follow the on screen prompts on you TV. It an talk to your iPhone, iPad, iPod and Apple TV with no problems. You can add several this to this like special plugs for you lamps so when you come home and it is dark you simply say, Hey Siri, please turn on the lights and she takes care of it for you. Ask her to turn on the Apple TV and guess what?"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great clear sound. Nice Bass,First smart speaker. Has great around the room sound with good bass that doesn’t distort at high volumes. Very heavy and solid. Not sure I like that’s it’s always listening. Still have not connected any smart home devices to it. Seems like the best of the smart speakers if you are going for sound.
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,More than just a speaker,"When I got my first HomePod I thought it was useful but I was not overwhelmed. Then I found out what it could do, especially when another one is in the room. They sense their surroundings and deliver the sound where you need it. This purchase was my fourth one, and they have done more than act as the best speakers because they have automated my home. They are easy to set up and an attractive addition to any room."
4.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,"highest quality, waiting for updates to functions","the sound is symphonic. it has the deepest levels and the clearest high notes. Siri has great functionality and it syncs with my other devices perfectly. I also own several Google Home mini's which are also impressive, and actually have more interactive capability with internet and information. I am waiting for the day that Apple updates the services that HomePod can provide."
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Awesome in Pairs,"I bought this for the bedroom. I already had one I was using in the living room. On a lark, I decided to conjoin the pair into stereo. They sound so good together I have to buy another one to take upstairs to the bedroom. Great Individually, but awesome in stereo. I admit the price can be daunting, but the sound quality makes it worth the money. If you are into Apple Music, these are second to none."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Sound is Game Changing,"This is a SPEAKER FIRST ABOVE ALL THINGS. People want to compare it to the other voice assistants but aside from the Sonos One and the Google Home Max, none of those are in the same stratosphere in terms of sound quality. Yes they all have more capable assistants, but Apple has said this is a speaker first and indeed it is. The bass is punchy and the sound is incredibly clear and loud. I could not believe that HomePod can hear me call for it when I can't even hear my own voice. Siri does almost everything that you realistically need from a digital assistant and her DJing is excellent. I am fully entrenched in the apple ecosystem so none of the limitations of this device apply to me, in my experience, it is amazing. I also am confident that Apple will improve Siri in iOS 12 and the HomePod will only become better with software updates. The hardware is aesthetic and sound is pristine. I am loving this speaker. If you are an apple fanboy, this is for you. If not, there are other capable speakers out there.Less"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Power in a Small Package,"I am an audiophile - I have a home theater that is in a class by itself, so a stand alone speaker doesn't strike me as something that could be impressive - but this one is. My daughter wanted a smart speaker for Christmas so I took a chance as everything else is Apple in the house. And this HomePod is amazing - the sound quality is impressive. And the Siri functionality is more fun than you get on your iPhone - Siri can't obviously give you a webpage ""here is what I found..."" so she tells you stuff. And you can control HomeKit items like lights. ""Hey Siri, Turn my light On / Green / Blue / Dim"" - our Daughter is having great fun with this."
1.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Lacking in functionality,"I was really stoked about this product, but Apple decided to release it without competitor-based features. The ONLY way to play music on this this thing is based on what Siri can access/understand. What I mean by this is Siri’s ability to access and read iTunes purchases and/or ripped music. For example, I requested Siri to play “Nutshell” by Alice In Chains on my iPhone X. It was ripped from my 20 year old CD. The first time I asked, I got a response of “I can’t do that. It’s not your library” when it actually was. I waited 10 mins and tried again only for her (it?) to play the “Unplugged”version instead of the “Jar of Flies” version. Eventually, after 5 attempts of asking her to play, did she play the studio version. It was at this point I realized I had zero control over what music I can play with this thing. There is no option to use the HomePod as a Bluetooth speaker or with ANY other streaming service other than Applemusic. Lame. This thing was released before other market-standard features are available to it (or will be (??)). I promptly returned my unit within an hour of buying it as the asking price for the functionality available is ridiculous. My advice? Wait for the 3rd generation as it should be cheaper and more feature rich than thing.Less"

The HomePod is very easy to set up - and Siri can be accessed via voice from a loud room. We purchased one initially and then another to create a stereo pair. I’m happy with our investment and recently added a 3rd to our bedroom. One of my main issues is with Siri - Alexa is much better and continues to outshine in almost every way - except the speaker. Highly recommended for those using Apple Music, but be sure to keep your Alexa device around for everything but the music."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Best Smart Speaker,"In terms of musical capabilities, no other smart speaker can hold a candle to the HomePod. This is my second, and I'm constantly impressed by the unit's ability to reproduce full frequencies (including sub-level bass) with fidelity and musicality at volume. It's really impressive. You can't order paper towels with it, which may or may not matter to you. (It doesn't to me – I see that as a plus, actually.) By virtue of the fact above, it's also more secure, and Apple's listening and encryption protocols are significantly better than Amazon's or Google's. It's expensive for a smart speaker, but it's the one to get, in my book."
5.0,a year ago,Target,Great speakers and also good for controlling smart devices.,"I love the HomePod - at $250 it was an even better deal. We have them throughout the house for audio (which is fantastic) and for controlling smart lights and other smart devices. In the bedroom, we have them paired in stereo (also cool and easy) and use them as speakers for the Apple TV. In the kitchen they make an extra speaker but more importantly serve to control lights and other smart fucntions and also serve as an asistant when cooking for timers and other needed info. Set up is a snap... plug it in and hold your phone near and it just pulls in all the settings. Completed in 30 seconds."
3.0,2 years ago,John Lewis,Good but nothing special,"I have to say I was disappointed in this product. Some of the press reviews are astoundingly positive and influenced my purchase. Some go as far as to say this is the best wireless speaker...ever. It is certainly not that. John Lewis sell many wireless speakers which are superior to this. It has an Apple simplicity and ease of use to it, but it feels very much like Apple's first attempt at a new product type. The spongy almost plastic-like cover is not terribly premium, but even worse the sound is ok but nothing special. It feels muddy, contained or boxed in, and not as clear as it could be. It's a bit similar to a Sonos One in sound quality. Good - and probably good enough for most people's needs. But certainly nothing better than just ok. If you are a real music quality fan then consider carefully before buying and listen to for example a B&W Zeppelin or the newer Technics wireless speaker and compare the sound. Both are more expensive and that probably tells you a lot about Apple's HomePod: Apple is not known to be cheap. This is an expensive entry or at best mid-range speaker. It is not designed to compete with the premium speakers on the market, and it doesn't do so. So it is outclassed at the high end for sound quality. And probably out-priced at the lower end. For similar sound quality, the Sonos One is a lot cheaper and arguably better looking and better made. I can see why Apple stalled before launching this and delayed its launch. But the delay hasn't cured it of its problems. I am an Apple fan, and would score my Macbook or iPhone X 9.9/10, but this speaker is a bit of miss for me. Not as good as you'd expect from Apple. Hopefully the version 2 will be better.Less"
5.0,a month ago,Currys,Nick's review of Apple HomePod,Pros: Works perfectly. Easy to set up. Looks good. Voice recognition good. Build quality excellent. Finds probably 80% of the music I ask for (some is quit unusual). Music quality very good for what it is. Overall a typical Apple product. Cons: Quite pricy compared to its competitors.
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Sounding Speaker,"Very happy camper, purchased 2 HomePods and am loving the sound. I am an Apple Music subscriber, but have not had any issues streaming iHeart Radio or YouTube to these speakers, so don't buy into the ""Apple doesn't play nice with others"" narrative. While admittedly not a huge audiophile geek, I can greatly appreciate the sound quality of these speakers...more importantly the wife can appreciate the difference as well. I need all the cred I can get when I buy new toys, lol. Do not hesitate purchasing these. I felt extremely to get these on sale for Black Friday, but hearing them now I'd have paid full price!"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Superior Sound in a Small Footprint,"Having only demoed this speaker one time in-store, I was initially hesitant about committing to the purchase. However, my reservations were quickly pushed away once I got the HomePod set up in my room. The device automatically calibrates sound output based on the shape + layout of the room it’s in, so there’s no need for complicated setup procedures. Additionally, the voice-activated option is great for controlling music from a distance, such as if I’m in bed + want to stop the music for the night, or getting ready for work + would like to hear the weather for the day. Of course, it’s aesthetically pleasing, as well. I would expect nothing less from Apple."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Awesome sound!,"I bought this as to function as the hub for my smart house. All of my smart home devices work within Apple universe, so this seemed a good buy. No doubt it’s expensive. But I love it! The sound is beautiful, the base tones are unbelievable. I love how it works with my iPad and iPhone to play music and control smart devices. I strongly recommend."
4.0,4 months ago,Other World Computing,problematic,"I discovered that to set up the HomePod, an Apple mobile device was required . I bought two and each one required Apple support to get working. required a supervisor's help. Some of the functions seem to require a working iPhone, like asking for a reminder. It can be used from a Mac computer but it seems to work best with iTunes. When listening to streaming audio from web site, the pair did not produce stereo but only monaural sound."
2.0,a year ago,Best Buy,No stereo support for OSX Mojave,"Sounds ridiculous with the resources Apple has...it would design and launch a speaker that cannot be used with its own laptops and desktop computers. A pair of HomePods only play in stereo in iTunes but the computer's audio is only played in either one of the speakers in the pair. The latency is also very annoying. Sound quality is okay but not great. They don't play very loud so in big rooms they will sound like small speakers. Bass is weak in medium/large rooms. Along with the Apple mouse, the HomePods are probably the worst Apple products of all time."
5.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Excellent sound quality plus Siri!,"This is my second HomePod, which I purchased to create a stereo pair with one that I bought last February. The sound reproduction is excellent, no matter what type of music I am playing. Excellent definition and clarity. Plus it works well with smart switches, etc., and Siri is a helpful assistant. Adding stereo creates broad, full sound stage."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Easy setup. Great sound. Pricey tho.,"After considering buying the HomePod since it’s release earlier this year, I finally splurged and bought it when it went on sale for Black Friday. It was so easy to set up. And all types of music sound great on it! Siri picks up commands easily, although sometimes when I have music on I do have to repeat my request a couple of times before Siri can hear it. Overall, I’m really enjoying this product. Although, I will say I don’t think it’s worth the non sale price and I would definitely wait for it to go on sale again before purchasing one."
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Best of the speakers/smart home for Apple users,"I gave this 4 stars because it is great, but pricey and has room to get a little more features of what Siri can do after new updates come. It is the BEST speaker option if you are an Apple Music User. I use Apple Music and have iPhones/iPads, etc. But...when I tested this, I fully expected to stick with my Sonos units even though they aren't super easy for my Apple Music. Well...I opened this Home Pod up, it immediately connected, and I have to say...I love it! I walk into my room and say ""Siri, play xxxxxx station"" - and it does. There is no weird delays and responses, just music coming on immediately. I even ask it the weather in the morning. I just love that I am not tied to my phone or an app. I just walk in and out of the room and tell Siri what to do LOL and she does it! I actually had a Sonos with Alexa out and this speaker, side by side. Music sounds similar but Home Pod is a little better and ruminates better...and it automatically calibrated for room instead of me having to manually do the setup with Sonos. My 9 year old daughter was testing both and said ""Mom, I like talking to Siri better."" And she was spot on. Seriously - the biggest advantage over Sonos to me is the way you communicate with Siri. It's smoother, easier, and then, it works perfectly with Apple Music. No Siri is not a genius yet and doesn't tell jokes. But for what she is supposed to do right now at this stage in the game, its great. So...hate to say you need to spend the money, but to me this is the best choice if you use Apple Music, and I'm so happy I have it. Now I want another one for another room....gotta save for that!Less"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Love the sound quality,"I got the HomePod on blackfriday with BestBuy providing a $100 off sale price. I think $250 is a much decently priced HomePod over the initial price that Apple had it. I have absolutely no regrets purchasing for this price. The sound quality is great. Works flawlessly with my computer and iPhone. I wish the sound quality would be better synchronized with the video I play whether it be on my Apple TV or my MacBook, but overall still satisfied with my purchase. I am sure down the road I will incorporate home kit more as apple increases Siri capabilities."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Superb sound!,The Apple HomePod sounds amazing! It’s hard to imagine such a superb sound comes from such a small device. Hands down the best sounding smart speaker there is on the market! Hey Siri feature can use improvement and better integration on the HomeKit. But if you subscribe to Apple Music this is a great addition to buy. Got it on sale and it was worth the sale price.
5.0,a year ago,very.co.uk,Excellent sound quality,"I’ve had this speaker just a week and I’m amazed with the crisp quality of the sound, absolutely perfect if anyone is looking for something compact that packs a punch. Streams seamlessly to multiple phones that are on the same WiFi network witch is great when guests are around. Also VERY useful for switching the lights on and off effortlessly, the mic picks up voice really well even when music is playing witch is a bonus. Quality speaker, maybe a little pricey but you definitely get what you pay for and it’s well worth it if sound quality is what your looking for."
4.0,7 months ago,ebay.com,"Less versatile than Alexa, but the sound is AMAZING!","I bought this HomePod to play music in my iTunes Match. I have an Amazon Echo Show and an Echo Dot. While I was happy with them, neither would play iTunes songs. The HomePod is somewhat less versatile than the Alexa devices, but the sound is far better. Setup was a breeze - Download the Home app on my iPhone, plug in the HomePod and everything else is automatic."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Speaker and looks great!,"I recently purchased the Space Gray HomePod after thinking about it for a few weeks, and finally pulled the trigger. I'm glad I did. Since I have many other Apple products, it was a no brainer. Even though it doesn't do as much as other smart assistants at the moment, I really think that it will in the future, with more HomeKit enabled devices and once AirPlay2 rolls out. This speaker really sounds great, and can go much louder than most people will even play it. But even at high volumes, it still sounds great with no distortion. Highly recommend for those that are already heavily entrenched within the Apple ecosystem."
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,"Excellent Sound, work extremely well","This is a great sounding device for Apple Products only. No usb or blue tooth, but it works very well. I got it on sale. I would not pay the full price. Siri has it limitations but does everything I need. I love how sensitive the mic are. I can control by voice just about any where. Siri responds to my commands."
5.0,2 years ago,John Lewis,Very nice sound,"I knew Apple were going to release a smart speaker into the market and I wanted to wait until each company released their offering so I could compare. I am very glad I waited, this speaker is definitely my favourite. Having used Alexa devices before, the ease of setup and use of this is incredibly easy and smooth by comparison, I never had to muck about in menus or apps to get it to work or connect, it’s such a slick and pleasant experience. No installing of apps or hassle, it all just works. Sound quality is excellent. It’s the best bit about this speaker. The ‘musicologist’ feature where it learns your taste and suggests new songs for you has been more than a pleasant surprise, I was expecting it to suggest songs that fairly generic/mainstream or whatever is popular, but it has been exceptional. The suggestions have led me to new bands or songs from my fave artists I’ve not heard yet. When multi room HomePod is released I will be purchasing a second one.Less"
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,"Sounds Amazing, Super responsive and Siri WORKS!","I have used/heard tons of different speakers and was reluctant when the HomePod came out. I was looking for a smart assistant speaker that also sounds great so naturally I was looking at the Sonos One (You can get TWO for what ONE HomePod costs). But I walked into Best Buy and saw the HomePod on display and after hearing it in person I knew its what I should buy. The sound quality is nothing short of AMAZING! It sounds great, especially for its size. NO you're not going to get the integration that comes with some of the other brands. NO you're not going to get to use it with Spotify or other streaming devices without using airplay. YES Siri is limited compared to her google/Amazon counterparts. But for me, a person completely immersed in the Apple ecosystem its perfect. I only use Apple Music for streaming and we only have Apple devices in our home (Macbook, iPad, iPhones, Apple TV and so on) so it makes since. If you are a heavy Apple user the HomePod is perfect for you. If not something like the Sonos One or Google Home may be better!Less"
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Buy a HomePod,"The HomePod is incredible! The audio quality is exceptionally good, and while it may be the best in terms of smart speakers some competitors don't fall far behind. Talking hardware, the HomePod comes out on top once again. The minimalistic design and styling help the HomePod blend into any setting. The clarity and spatial awareness are just unmatched by competitors. However, there is an issue named Siri. Now Siri works great for the average user but there is no denying she falls a bit behind compared to other assistants. A lot of these limitations I expect will be improved with future updates. These limitations are in no way a deal breaker because it works perfectly with many HomeKit enabled devices. The HomePod works seamlessly with Apple Music, but Spotify users still shouldn't look elsewhere. Spotify streaming is still supported via Airplay. Overall, I think HomePod is well worth its steep price tag.Less"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great addition to Apple-centric household.,"Great audio pickup. Can hear and respond to commands from 20-25 feet away. I have an open floor plan and my HomePod can hear me from the kitchen, dining room, living room and bedroom. Sound quality seems good, although I don't use it for music very often. Having Siri converse with Google Assistant can be pretty entertaining, as well. :P"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Fantastic speaker... I returned it,"If you don't have a smart speaker and you use Apple Music, this is the one to get. I tried it for two weeks and wanted so badly to keep it. Apple puts a lot of restrictions on Siri, some in the name of privacy, which is good, but some seem to be there just to steer you away from competitive services. With Alexa, you can access radio stations on iHeart and TuneIn and use alternative music services such as Pandora, Spotify, and Sirius XM (many services need paid subscriptions). In the end, I returned it because Alexa offers me greater functionality. I thought about keeping the HomePod just for music, but it's too confusing having two AI's for different purposes."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,good integration in apple eco system,"I have numerous SONOS speakers that I bought prior to airplay2 support. I like the idea of a digital assistant in a speaker but not interested in my data being used to sell me products (amazon) or sold to advertisers (google.) So I choose the HomePod. I really wish apple had something similar to the SONOS's control panel app. Siri can be frustrating at times but and while that's not specific to the HomePod, it is the only way to control the HomePod without just using it as an airplay speaker for another device. (SONOS speakers have an app that allows controlling all the speakers and audio played on each speaker which can then be grouped for playback throughout the house.)"
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Even better having two,I've had my original HomePod for well over a year and love it. The professional reviews aren't kidding when they talk about the sound from this little beast.

I should have purchased the second one when I purchased my first.
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great speaker,"These are not as smart as the google and amazon devices, but they also can't compare to the quality of sound of this speaker. It'll do basic tasks such as texting, phone calls, alarm clock, and play music. I got it on sale and at the price i paid i would recommend this product. It sounds great and can fill your home with quality volume while taking up very little space."
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,The Clarity and ease of use.,Great product. Wonderful sound. Clarity with all types of music and enough bass to give those who love heavy bass driven music satisfaction. Siri is responsive. Only downside is that its chorded and remains stationary but that's not enough to rate it any lower. Apple outdid themselves with this device. Impressed and I'm not even an apple fan.
4.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,98% of what I want,"This is my second Homepod (first one was bought early-white) was waiting for Airplay 2 for stereo. I find I use Siri more than I thought I would from easy weather forecast to adding to grocery list (reminders) as I think of it to sending a quick message (Imessage) and use both the timer and alarm quite often. Music is terrific-big room with partial 2 story-I ask Siri to play one of number of playlists (about 98% accuracy), play Radio or even one of the NPR stations-and the sound is very very good, room filling, excellent bass and mid and with 2, well, stereo is....stereo. I have also tried it with one song in one room, one in another or same in both. Airplay 2 works very well. Recommend if you are an Apple user."

3.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Sound is great! Everything else not so mych,"If you’re in the Apple system, good smart speaker but not great. Siri is still behind Alexa and google .

Can’t recommend it, for price and other alternatives have it beat hands down."
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Not a breakthrough,"This is a really silly purchase. $350 for a non-stereo music system is kinda stupid. Sure, it sounds better than the Google Home Max or new Amazon Echo, but the Max is a low bar and the Echo is a third of the price. Not that big of an achievement. Pros: -Decent sound for a non-stereo speaker, but won't fool anybody into thinking there is a large soundstage, even with its technology. -Best microphone sensitivity; a regular volume of speech will trigger the Homepod at max volume, very impressive Cons: -Expensive -Worse than 2 Sonos One's, which provide true stereo -Extremely limited music streaming service support"
2.0,a year ago,Best Buy,I want to love it but...,"First off if you live in the Apple ecosystem this would normally be a no brained BUTTTT it’s priced $150 too much for what it is. Sure you get a great audio quality product, robust build quality, ability to control your Apple Music, speaker phone and other BASIC Siri functions but it needs to do more. I would love nothing more than to replace my Sonos ecosystem with multiple HomePods but the price is far too much, Siri without a screen to link you to a webpage is seriously lacking and inability to control some of the more popular smartphone products (nest I’m looking st you) it makes for a hard pill to swallow. HomePod I so want you to work, Apple please come in-line with proper pricing and at minimum allow Spotify...please."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Best sound ever,"We have the Bose Mini, several JBL bluetooths, 3 Alexas, and a Google mini, and this Apple Home Pod blows them all away. Of course, that's not fair to compare to any of these, as they are all at least half the size of the home pod, but just saying, if sound is your number one reason to buy such a speaker, then get this piece. Tapping to mute is awesome. ""Hey Siri"" works awesome. If only Siri could search the web better.... ah, but that's another story. [So many times she says ""Sorry, I don't know that,"" and then we say ""Hey Google,"" and ask her that same question and Google is full of information. Share the wealth, people! :))))]"
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,"Great sound, Siri lacks","Great sounding speakers. Lack of external inputs is a downer. Wish Apple would create a hub for other inputs that can work with home pods.

With HomeKit and Airplay coming on TVs now, this may become a possibility with iOS 14/HomePod 14"

I hope to pick up another one to pair both speakers as stereo pair."

It isn’t as capable as a higher level soundbar - meaning it’s doesn’t create the wide sound field for movies, but it is decent nonetheless. Where it really excels is with music. These things can get loud and they sound great, however the bass might be too heavy for some people. I like the bass, so no complaints here."
4.0,2 years ago,John Lewis,"Great Sound Quality, Less So The ""Assistant""","As a long time Apple consumer, this was always going to be a purchase. We already have an Echo which is very impressive and well-used for music, trivia, calling etc... First impressions were nice and solid, well-made, typically Apple looking design. Set up was a doddle, just holding my iPhone close to it and all wireless settings, iCloud account details etc. transferred seamlessly. First test was to ask Siri to ""play music"", which she did based on my Apple Music account trends. The sound quality is head and shoulders above that of the Echo and also an improvement on my B&W MM1 speakers. A lovely rich sound with great bass. Plenty of volume too. You can also use it as a speaker phone when using your iPhone. In terms of an ""assistant"", not so great. No integration yet with your Calendar, Reminders etc. and lots of random questions were met with ""I don't know"" compared to Alexa. This will no doubt improve over time but for the moment, the focus is on sound quality and that side of it is fantastic.Less"

Siri handles all of the normal requests perfectly— weather, traffic, questions about music/artists, plus a great DJ so you don’t always have to reach for your phone/ipad. My previous speaker of choice was a Sonos Play 5– Homepod has since replaced that and the Sonos has been moved to a different location in my house. There really is no comparison between the google/amazon products in terms of sound quality— Homepod blows them out of the water and you actually enjoy what you’re listening to... Makes music fun again!"

Didn't find it to be loud enough as a single speaker so I will stick with my audioengine a5+. The homepods in stereo pair probably would do the trick but very overpriced even on sale for $199. Also couldn't get siri to recognize multiusers, which put a damper on things as well."

I already had one in my living room, but one for the bedroom is very helpful for voice-controlling Hue lights and setting different scenes/ color profiles right from bed.

Overall very happy with the yearly holiday savings as expected."

The Good: I really do like the appearance, but I wish the power cord were 2-3 feet longer. The sound is very good, but not as good as the price would suggest. The Bad: I thought this would be easier to instruct since it is supposedly better at hearing over noise....I have a 2 month old that I have to basically yell over so that google can hear me.....the Apple HomePod isn't too much better. The Nasty: I signed up for Apple Music, expanded cloud storage, I have an iphone/pad/mac, etc... I can't get this thing to work with my Home App at all. It can't control my hue lights or thermostat. I spent a couple hours with customer support and we ended the conversation with the solution being that I would be called back later in the week after more tech conversations took place. google home sucks- Apple was promising, but I can't get it to work, and certainly not for the price point with this level of quality I have not given in to trying the online vendor's version, even though a fellow tech buddy of mine has it and it has been flawless for him......I will resist, but I will have to wait for the next iteration of Apple HomePod or Google Home.

If you like the experience that good sound provides and have a Mac or iOS devices, you want this speaker."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Incredible Sound Quality,"I’ve been blown away by the quality of the sound from this pint sized speaker. The level of engineering it took to extract the audiophile grade sound from this speaker is remarkable. I”m a musician who listens to a very broad spectrum of genres, and this speaker handles them all flawlessly. Music is once again painting a beautiful hue of colors in our household on a daily basis thanks to the HomePod. The sound is very reminiscent of the days of old when I would listen to records on my friends record player through Cerwin Vega speakers. Very warm, clean and pristine sound."
5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,A MUST HAVE FOR MUSIC LOVERS,If youre looking for a product thats smart and going to do everything in your home for you then you should probably keep looking but if you have the mindset of just purchasing an amazing quality speaker this is it. Then the few smart features it has are just a bonus rather than a let down when compared to its competitors. One area this smart home device does out perform the competition is having the ability to basically carry a conversation. When talking about a certain topic you can go back and forth with Siri not having to state what it is youre talking about each time unlike all the others out there. Overall very satisfied with my purchase and would highly recommend to a music lover like myself.
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,I’m in love!,"I knew an Apple product would not disappoint. What I didn’t expect was to be so blown away by the sound it produces! I’m a very picky customer when it comes to sound quality. I have several BT speakers that have now been rendered obsolete in my home. The HomePod is my new #1! I have smart lights too, and it’s fun to have Siri control the ambience in the room as I listen to literally any song I want. I will patiently wait for what Apple brings to the HomePod next, bc I know it will be amazing! Buy this speaker, get some smart lights, (Lifx is my fave) sit back and enjoy a space created just for you!"
3.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Wake up Apple!,"This is a great sounding speaker with a lot of potential, but it does fall short of the value/price point equation. I’m am waiting for a detachable cord, and more importantly Bluetooth capability, to purchase this product again. I know Apple is pushing their music only, but I am beginning to wonder if they realize how much more product they would move if they just offered the ability to play from other services. I guess they’ve got enough market share."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Good sound, better as a pair.","I waited for a sale and when the price dropped by $100 I decided to purchase. I’m a Sonos user and love the Sonos sound. It’s not really fair to compare 1 of these to a Play 5. 1 HomePod sounded good, not great. Not super loud, not super clear. Not bad at all, good sound just not full or rich. Added a second to create a stereo sound and that has definitely improved the sound. Much fuller, still lacks the detail of a Sonos, but it’s closer now. I’ve not listened as much as I’d like to give a detailed review as a pair but I’m more impressed than I was with just 1."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Outstanding!,"Hands down the winner in sound quality over Amazon’s best. I was so impressed, I returned to Best Buy and bought 2 more! I paired two of them to make a stereo pair in the bedroom and I am ecstatic. Won’t work with Spotify, but Apple Music subscription fits the bill. Well done Apple. Note: I purchased these speakers when they were on sale for $199. Worth every cent."
4.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Great sound and looks. Get it on sale.,"Easy set up with any iOS device. Pair seemlessly and sounds excellent. Siri is good at finding music. Besides Apple Music, you can AirPlay any other channel like Spotify or Pandora, not a big deal. Since they must be plugged in, they’re not truly portable. That said, they fit unobtrusively into most any room."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great for music and simple “smart” stuff,"While I wish this was as useful as a google home device, if you’re intending this primarily for music I find it hard to beat. Really good sound, it “hears” you well over loud volumes and integrates beautifully with an iPhone. Certainly not for everyone, but if you’re in the Apple universe and like music, this is a pretty nice device."
4.0,a week ago,John Lewis,Average budget priced smart speaker,Already owning 2 B&O M5 speakers I decided to add some smartness to my home sound setup. The speaker delivers a moderately wide ranging and full sound capturing the sharpness and bassiness simultaneously. The sound is nowhere near as strong as the M5 but good enough for some home music or podcasts. Not for the audiophiles out there
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Excellent Addition,"Let me preface this by saying my current living situation is a sizable efficiency and only use Apple products and Apple Music lover. I have been using a Sony SRS X55 for 2 years which I love but recently realized that I rarely take it out the house and when I do, like at a hotel I end up not using it and will now just take my Beats headphones instead of a BT speaker. So the HomePod has been a great replacement and better successor to my beloved Sony which I gave to my mother (I’ll borrow it later). Siri has been a game changer and I get up earlier for work with the alarm and then telling Siri to blast music to wake me up and start my day. Lastly I also use the HomePod with a Lifx smart bulb that is HomeKit compatible. I never turn off the light because I fall asleep. Now I can tell Siri good night and finally save on some electricity. This is a great sounding speaker with SOME smart speaker features. Must buy for the Apple club members only. Sorry Droid boys/galsLess"
5.0,10 months ago,eglobalcentral.co.it,Great service,"Was a bit sckeptical of buying here because I got a HomePod for 70 euros less than the apple store. The shipment took around 2 weeks so if you’re in a hurry this isn’t for you. But if you can wait a few weeks, and want to spend less money I highly recommend it. Also bought an iPad Pro 11'' and Apple Pencil 2 with them and everything arrived alright. PS: all the plugs were US ones, but they’re very considerate and send an adaptor with every package. Well done guys!"
2.0,a month ago,Currys,Mr A's review of Apple HomePod,"Pros: Good sound quality, solid construction, understands speech well. Cons: Very limited compatibility, doesn't have Bluetooth, can't access iTunes playlists, can't play radio stations, repeatedly requires resetting to overcome connectivity issues, can't help with many simple spoken questions. Not a great ambassador for artificial intelligence."
5.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Best sounding smart speaker,Excellent tonal spatial balancing. Sounds 3-4 times bigger than it looks. Spatial awareness really works Is by far one of the clearest most hifi sounding speakers I’ve purchased. Siri integration needs work but gets better with every update. The tech on this device was and still is ahead of it’s time.
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,"Its not a speaker, its an ""experience."" Buy","I have never been reserved about investing in new Apple products, up until now. This product had me perplexed, but my curiosity got the best of me. I pre-ordered, cancelled, then pre-ordered again and received the product on Feb 9, despite shipping info that it would be Feb 12. I am a ""modified"" audiophile. Having grown up in the 70's, I experienced and purchased all things audio. Albums, tapes, CD's, and hardware. Was dissapointed with the degradation in audio quality. Digital files killed me, but it is what it is, or was? I gave up my ""heavy"" audio equipment a few years ago and went to a home of small pods that were supposed to sound ""amazing."" and be accessible in a digital fashion. None of them excited me, but they did the trick. I went through B&O, B&W Zeppelins, etc... It all sounded great, but not soul filling. Opened the Homepod from Apple and set it up. It was totally easy to set up, but confusing to understand where in my ""space"" to put it. I chose a corner. After the setup, it took a day to appreciate the sound quality. It was different, not good or bad, just something my ears have not heard or been used to. Played with different genres of music to get a better feel for it. Miles Davis, Journey, Coldplay, Brad Paisley, Led Zeppelin, and of all things, the Churches (who have amazing electronic music). It almost felt like the Homepod needed a day to ""breathe"" and get its lungs. The Homepod woke up, and started to provide amazing sound that I cant describe, just amazing depth. This is a ""small"" speaker, but the sound that comes out of it is not only unreal (for its size) but beats anything I have owned before. I am embarrassed to say that I want to gift my B&W zeppelin and B&O small BT speakers to family, because they served me well for a while. No matter where I am in my home, I never have to yell at the homepod. Its a simple ""Hey Siri, do this"" and it gets done. I have not had any mistakes out of the voice recognition, which simply amazes me. I have been yelling at Amazon Echo's from 20 feet away to get a simple task done. I would suggest buying this, easily. I am still amazed at what Apple did with the sound quality and its ability to ""listen carefully"" to commands. So far, so good. I am a firm believer Apple is poising this device to take over home automation. This is a test period for them to understand what HP capabilities are.Less"
5.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Stand out audio,I bought this replacing a Bose soundlink air. I’d heard reviews talking about how good the audio was. I wasn’t disappointed. Absolutely hands down better sounding than the Bose soundlink. With improvements to airplay2 meaning that over WiFi the music never skips or stutters. And the Siri integration is handy for some home lights etc I already have. They sounded so good I bought two more and now play music all over the house at once. It is slightly more expensive compared to Sonos offerings but if you care about audio then you won’t be disappointed
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Another great Apple product....,"As I am ""all things Apple,"" this fit in perfectly to enhance my music streaming experience. A breeze to play my Apple Music, podcasts, audiobooks through the HomePod. Love having Siri read & answer texts, answer questions, give me the weather, news etc. This is my second one & the stereo sound from having both pods playing together is great. And the set-up is quick & east."
2.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Just OK for now,"My entire home is Apple with Homekit enabled lights, locks, thermostats and so on and so on. I absolutely love Apple and have no problems with any of the product. Now there is the ""but"". I did think that HomePod would be like my iPhone or iPad, but it doesn't get close. It basically is the most expensive timer for the kitchen I've ever bought. Yes, it does work with Homekit but it doesn't connect to the Web so I can't do many of the things I wish that it would, as Alexa does. I have Sonos filling the entire house with music, and I'm told I will be able to control Sonos with Siri and HomePod end of year. I'm going to keep wishing Siri (HomePod) will go back to school and get it right."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Incredible Sound,"I have been firmly entrenched in the Apple environment, including Apple Music. That said, I was blown away with how good the Homepod sounded in my family room. It is not the equivalent of the several thousand dollar surround sound system in my media room, but it is not far away. I immediately went out and bought a second one for my study. I can now play them individually or play music on them simultaneously using Airplay 2. I could care less about Siri. Buy it for the sound. The Homepod is truly in a class by itself and a steal for the price."
4.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Usual high standard Apple product,"Very happy with this. Wish I could access radio stations which would make it perfect. Perhaps Siri could be less standoffish- he’s certainly less chatty than Alexa! But I bought this for sound quality and ease of use and it does not disappoint in either category. I bought in store as it is brilliant that I could try all my shortlisted products and listen to their relative sound. I tend to look online and then go to the store- not the usual way round but it works well for me. The staff, as always were brilliant! Did not bat an eyelid when I was trying “Yes” and “Pink Floyd” at considerable volume!!!!"
5.0,2 years ago,John Lewis,A very good speaker for Apple users,"I gave a lot of consideration to reviews and comments on the internet before buying a Homepod. I have an iphone,ipad and imac plus I have subscribed to Apple music since it started. I was not so interested in Siri to be honest but I was interested in a good sounding speaker that dovetailed with my other Apple products as they do with each other. I have not been disappointed, its easy to set up and after a little bit of experimentation very easy to use with all my devices and the sound is excellent. Siri works much better than I expected, but in fairness my threshold may be lower than others( I hate talking to ansaphones , nevermind speakers!) But it picks up my voice remarkably well even if I talk quietly and is more versatile than I expected given many reviews I read,it certainly helps me explore Apple music and is much easier to use than a regular bluetooth speaker ,via airplay etc.( it can play spotify etc this way too just fine) So if you are an full Apple user and have or are considering subscribing to Apple music it offers a first rate speaker that is easy to use( just like their airpods do too) it is well worth considering....if not I think Sonos or Bose would be a good bet.Less"
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,"Incredible sound, incredible microphones","All of the other reviews can tell you how great these things sound. They really do sound amazing. The true stereo mode isn't yet enabled, but you can get an idea of the sound by playing two of them at the same time currently by airplaying via iTunes on a computer. It's pretty insane. The volume and clarity these little cantaloupes can achieve is remarkable. That said, the thing that blows me away the most is their microphones. They're heads and shoulders above the Echo. I played my echo at full blast to try to compare the sound. When I was about 20 feet away from the homepod, I lightly spoke into my iPhone ""Hey Siri, what song is this?"" to see what song the Echo was playing.... The homepod heard me over my phone, from 20 feet away, while the Echo was blasting away. The homepod can be blaring at 100% volume and still hear you from afar saying ""Hey siri turn the volume to 50%"" without issue. It makes talking to it so much more casual than the Echo. I will be purchasing more once they roll out Airplay 2 in full.Less"
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Amazing,"First of all, all the negative reviews on here seem to be from people who did not do their research prior to purchasing. This is specifically for people in the Apple ecosystem if you want to maximize it's potential. If you do not have an iphone/ipad and are not subscribed to Apple music, this purchase is NOT for you. The sound from this thing is AMAZING. Apple always puts out quality product, which is why people pay their premium prices. I have not had any issue with Siri, even thought I was skeptical because it seems to kind of suck on my phone. The ease with which to play music or ask it questions cannot be understated. Works flawlessly. Also connected it to my hue lights and it works great as well. I already completely forgot about my echo. If you are in the Apple ecosystem and subscribe to Apple music, you will NOT be disappointed in the sound/ease of use/quality of this product. Absolute homerun for a small portable speaker.Less"
4.0,a year ago,Target,"Great sound, but buy it somewhere else","I ordered the HomePod for pickup in store the next day. The first item that I picked up was obviously a used product - markings, hair, and writing inside the box (which was not sealed with any plastic wrap). I returned to the store, and received a replacement item. However, the replacement item was not sealed with any plastic wrap, just like the first. I question whether or not the replacement item was used as well. Why aren't HomePods sold at Target sealed with plastic wrap as they are in the Apple store? If not on sale, I recommend buying somewhere else."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Apple Home Pod,"The pod is very sturdy. You have to plug it in, it can connect to multiple devices via Bluetooth but only one at a time. Siri will answer questions such as weather and will change music on command. Sound quality is very good. We haven’t tried some of the other features it could have as of yet, but excited it will outperform all others."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Speaker,Speaker sounds great. I have had it since the day it was released. When I first purchased it thought it had too much bass then apple did an upgrade which removed a lot of the bass. I would have preferred to make my own decision on the upgrade. It still sounds great. I like using in my office at work and even on low volume you can feel the bass in other offices. This weekend I brought it home to play thunderstorms while I sleep. It sounds like the storm is in the room. The thunder sounds like it’s coming from everywhere
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,A great device for Seniors,"Purchased this device for my friend who has Parkinson Disease and whose tremors made it extremely difficult for him to use his phone. Not only has it make it very easy to use his phone, but it has improved the experience of those with whom he talks on the phone. Moreover he loves the music and knowledge available thru Siri. It has really changed his attitude and improved the quality of his day to day life"
3.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Opened Box Item Glitchy,"I purchased my first one back in April and absolutely love it. I decided to purchase a second and saw that an open box certified one was a available. I purchased it and shortly after getting it home I noticed that it was a bit glitchy. It doesn't always respond to voice commands and often starts playing music on its own. Overall, I love the product its just this one has a personality of its own."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Ignore the haters-- this thing works,"If you are looking for a home speaker that also works on a corporate network... or you are looking for a speaker that is super easy to set up... and you are not thinking about a whole-home speaker system (I have Sonos for that)... and you are looking for something that sounds good for its size-- this is it. I don't use the Siri stuff much (never), I just push music from my phone or AppleTV. Works and looks and sounds great."
5.0,a year ago,very.co.uk,if I could give it 10 stars I would.,"I’ve read people complaining about this speaker and I really don’t know why. It’s an Apple product so obviously it’s only going to work with other Apple products. The sound quality is amazing I had a Sonos 1 and it was sent straight back but this is a keeper. The sound quality is clear and the best is heavy which is quite surprising from such a small speaker. You can play what you want through it as long as you have an Apple iPhone, iPad etc. I’ve been listening to YouTube and facebook videos without a problem. Aye it’s a bit pricey but you get what you pay for. I’ll be buying a second when they release airplay 2 and a second job."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Great speaker,"Item was better than expected. Siri understands all in my household. We can say her Siri from downstairs and be heard. The set up was very easy, it even connects to my phone and my husbands. Very loud speaker, clear, and we like the ease of taking it places. The only down side is that it’s not wireless, wish this $300 speaker was wireless but it’s great besides that"
4.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Great speaker for playing music,"This is our second HomePod. I think they are great. As most people state, them may not be the best smart speaker. However, it does what I need or want a smart speaker to do. Plus, the sound is excellent. Can’t go wrong with this speaker. I will say if your not in a rush wait until sales are expected. It’s usually $50 cheaper when on sale."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Best small speaker I’ve owned,"The HomePod is wonderful. It sounds amazing no matter where I place it in the room. The sound is incredible from high tones to bass. Once I got used to using Siri, the speaker even got better, and I don’t worry about it listening to my general conversations like the previous speaker I had. Highly recommend the HonePod!"
5.0,10 months ago,Other World Computing,Homepod worth every penny!!,"OWC's pricepoint on the Homepod is outstanding, $100 below what you normally pay for them and they all work fantastic. Super easy to install, solid construction, and wonderful sound. I listen to my music library more than I ever did before. Highly recommend. If you are on the fence about making the purchase, don't be. These will be a super addition to any Mac-household."
4.0,2 years ago,very.co.uk,"The best sounding, worst smart speaker","First off, this speaker is fantastic. The bass is amazing and the overall sound is superb for it's size. The sound encompasses the room so well and looks very attractive wherever you want it in your room. Siri on the other hand isn't great and needs some work from Apple to get it close to its competitors. Updates will follow, but its annoying its not great to start off with. I would recommend the HomePod as a music speaker, as I think its better than the the others in the same price bracket. HomePod works extremely well in a Apple eco system household especially with Apple Music. If your looking for a smart speaker that helps you with reminders, shopping list, turning lights on/off and general questions, I'd leave it a while until Apple update the product so it's on par with the other smart speakers. It'll get there, but it leaves you asking the question, why is it not there already?Less"
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Excellent,"This speaker performs beyond! It hears commands in the room even with the volume at its max. This speaker is compact, sleek and intuitive and I would recommend it to anyone. My primary use is for Apple Music radio stations, weather, and phone calls. It performs my three primary uses well. Well done. P.S- the music playback quality is out of this world!"
3.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Not as smart as expected,"Delivery was excellent and well packaged. The HomePod itself will not connect to my playlist in the Apple Music app on my phone, iPad or Mac or my TV. I have to actually use my Apple TV to connect by screen mirroring. Also, every time I lean over it without touching it it com es on. I can be across the room talking and never say Hey Siri and it comes on. Have to make a trip to the Apple store next week. It also is space gray and puts off this white film just like reported on the white ones. Hoping it gets smart soon. I really wanted it for my gospel collection."
5.0,a year ago,very.co.uk,Fantastic!!,"If reviewing the HomePod as an audiophile: Great for a medium sized room or a flat. It is no HiFi replacement.. but not far of! It is a good looking piece of kit, that fits into any environment. If reviewing as a tech lover who is invested into the Apple eco system: This is the smart speak for you! I was so impressed in the HomePod I purchased a second one. As a stereo pair I was even more impressed. The personal assistant features are not as complex as other competitors, but the audio quality can not be beaten in its category."
5.0,7 months ago,Target,Wow am I impressed. Fantastic sound quality in a small good looking package. Full rich bass and crystal clear mid and high range. The HomePod replaces Bose units.

4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Sound - Siri Not Bad,"I took a gamble on this product, previously being a sonos purchaser. The sound quality if really good, with a decent amount of base. I love listening to the sound quality and how it fills the room. Siri on the other hand is ok. She doesn't offer as many features as the Amazon Echo, or google, but that is ok. The voice controls could use some work, and a more enhanced interface from your phone would be nice. Otherwise it does get the job done and works pretty well."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Sounds Great!,"Picked this up for an event that I was having outside and it was easy to set up the blue tooth, used my iphone and played music throughout the night! The sound was fantastic and carried out perfectly even though it was close to an outlet so there wasn't a lot of mobility on where you could place it. Now it is by home entertainment center and I play music from time to time. The Hey Siri function works great and the music sounds great in any part of the home. Another benefit is that I have it on a glass side table which I thought wouldn't sound so great but there is no change when placing it on a glass versus something like a hardwood table. Happy with the purchase!"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Home Automation has started,"Night the HomePod to start my home automation with new thermostats and controlling garage doors. It’s hard finding certain types of items that are HomeKit compatible. So far everything is working properly.

5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,So far - incredibly,"To my surprise, the parcel came a little rumpled from all angles, without additional cardboard packaging, in polyethylene. But the device itself was not damaged in any way - everything is in order. So far, too pleased and mad at the acquisition. Happy, shorter. In the near future I will test and quietly check all the functions. To the seller of many thanks for such possibility, - to buy before start of sales in Latvia (if they in general will be). P.S. If interested in more detail, then the video ""HomePod - first unboxing in Latvia"" on YouTube by Dmitry Kunitsky. And yes, I'm a techno blogger. (Honestly. I do not quite like this word.)"
5.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Sounds amazing,This unit is the absolute best sounding speaker in its class. The far field microphone beats every other voice assistant unit on the market—and I’ve tried them all. I don’t use Siri for home automation but when I want to listen to music it picks up my voice as if I’m talking to someone face-to-face—even if I’m 35 feet away from. Better than echo and absolutely crushes google voice recognition.
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Best sound of any speaker I have heard,"Love this product! Waited a while to see if I could get some money off and it was worth the wait! It has some of the best sound I have ever heard and it’s almost a new experience with each song as you listen through it. You start to notice subtle aspects of each song that were previously undetectable. In short, this thing is a steal for under $299"
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,"Great Product, but Siri...","The quality of the HomePod is second to none. The speaker and sound quality is amazing. Ended up returning it because Siri just isn’t that smart (yet). Even though it’s not designed to connect to TV’s, it can, but requires a new connection each time the TV is turned on which is frustrating. Hoping with an upgrade with Siri, the HomePod will improve."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,2nd One I’ve Bought,This one was for my son. If you love music and subscribe to Apple Music this is hands down the way to go. If you want a speaker you can talk to cause you need a friend then get Alexa. They update that thing every day so you can ask it more things so you never have to go out and communicate with actual people. It was fun for about a week the Apple is great 24/7. I listen to thunder storms all night and music all day. Even bought a cool case to bring back and forth to work and now twice to Indiana. Only negative is that it has to be plugged in to power but that doesn’t matter to me.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Enjoying Apple HomePod,My family is really enjoying the Apple HomePod. We have it in our sitting room and listen to music when we are in the adjoining kitchen area. The sound is rich and has a lot of bass. This speaker is also very loud which my daughter loves. We have it connected with the Home App and it is capable of turning on and off our Hue Lights. Highly recommend this speaker. We also have a Google Home and Google Mini. The sound of the Apple Home Pod just blows out the Google products.
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Bought as a speaker rather than a smart device.,"Bought to replace an old Bose Sound Dock. While it does have smart functionality, I bought this purely for its sound and to work with my apple iTunes / music library. The audio is brilliant, clear, warm sound that fills a room. It’s ‘siri’ functionality Is good but arguably not as great as others (Alexa) but I’m an apple fan so it works perfectly with all my existing equipment. If you want a device to turn off/on your lights, there’s cheaper devices, if you want to play music this is great."
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,"Awesome sound, especially when paired w/2nd Pod","Having 2 HomePods paired produces awesome stereo sound.

5.0,5 days ago,Best Buy,Worth it!,"For the price, the HomePod can't be beat. The HomePod is essentially a ""professional"" sound system (without all the bulk).

Sometimes Siri forgets the HomeKit devices that we have connected (we end up having to use the iPhone app to turn them on / off)."
5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Perfect sound for its purpose,"HomePod was a good value on this Auction; but at retail is too pricey relative to buying a normal system. Apple rumored to have a less expensive version in the works. I like it; and considered a second for 'stereo' home theater. But with Dolby Atmos supported by Apple TV 4k and NOT by HomePod, I think I will leave this to the one unit in the kitchen and buy Atmos for the entertainment room. And of yes; I works fine and has incredible and clear volume for its size. Far better than the cheaper speakers often compared with."
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great smart speaker for music,This speaker works great for playing music. I bought a 2nd to pair in stereo in my family room and the volume increased significantly. Built in microphone is the best! Do not have to raise voice for Siri to hear you even when volume is set to 100%! All other speakers require you to raise your voice and sometimes yell.
5.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Excellent sound quality,"This is an amazing sound system for its size. It gives excellent clarity and the bass, although not chest thumping, is fantastic when the size of the unit is taken into account. It is super easy to set up with an apple phone and Siri finds almost all that is asked for when connected to Apple Music. I have this speaker in a large room and I am pleased with the way this unit is able to fill the room without sounding thin. Of course it is not stereo but that does not seem matter as the sound is so involving. The next stage will be to purchase some lights that can be controlled from the Hub:-)"
5.0,a month ago,Currys,John's review of Apple HomePod,"Pros: The sound is amazing! If you are after sound quality then its a no-brainer.

I previously owned 2 x Bose SoundTouch speakers and was pretty happy with them but the software just wasn’t up to the job. I now have 2 x HomePod and love the sound, ease of use and of course, being Apple, they look beautiful. At the moment I am setup as 2 separate speakers in 2 different rooms but now thinking, I bet they sound great as a stereo pair in one room. I may have to buy another, just hope my wife doesn’t read this!"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Everything you expect from Apple!,"Great unboxing and build quality. Fast and easy to install. Just works – if you are all in on the Apple ecosystem. If you are looking for the bells and whistles of Alexa or Google Assistant, this is not it. But if you want amazing sound and a constantly albeit slowly growing feature set, this is your product. Buy two for easy sterero!"
3.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,"Great product, wrong time place to buy","I bought this HomePod thinking and about opening it and using it in my tech channel. Turned out however that the product was damaged when I opened it. It looked as if someone had accidentally dropped it in its head and internally damaged the top display. Dispite that, the product worked fine in my home and created a crystal clean sound for any types of music."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,BEST SOUNDING SMART SPEAKER,"The sound quality of HomePod is amazing. Of course, the main features will be turned on later this year and with the great quality sound combined with Airplay 2 it is a no brainer this is the best smart speaker to have. I was amazed I could go full volume and fill the room with music that was not distorted in the least. Again, sound is amazing and the HomePod will just get better with AirPlay 2 for multiroom playing and being able to connect two HomePods together. Great potential for this product. A must have for an Apple ecosystem."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great Speaker,This is my second HomePod ... I use it for music and merge them together and connect them to my AppleTV in the master bedroom. Works great most of the time however Apple needs to work on a easier way to keep them connected without always going to the settings in the Apple TV. Super simple to connect as all Apple products are. It was on sale and I should have bought more.
3.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Prefer Sonos,"I bought this after also investing in Sonos speakers. I prefer the Sono interface to the complete dependency on Siri to drive the HomePod. (Although, I bought this before AirPlay2 shipped. It might be better now,) I ended up returning the HomePod and getting another Sonos and pocketed the cost difference. I really like the Sonos and didn't think the HomePod sounded better."
2.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Siri is horrible,"I’ve had Alexa, Google, and Apple Siri devices. Siri is the worse assistant overall. The HomePod plays music very clear but I was very disappointed with how this speaker does not play loud enough. The bass is lacking as well. I would recommend the Echo Studio which is light years ahead of the rest."
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Love this speaker,"I own an Alexa and a HomePod. There’s no comparison in sound quality. The HomePod linked to Apple Music is a killer combination. However, Siri has a bit to go before she is as good as Alexa answering questions. I use my HomePod as a hub for home automation too which works really well. As usual the styling of this product is spot on."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Amazing sound...still lacking,"I wanted to absolutely love this speaker. I am in love with the sound. The bass is good and it is extremely loud. However, the lack of Spotify support is what really drags this speaker down for me. You are able to play Spotify over AirPlay but I would really love to use voice controls to play my playlists. If Apple incorporates Spotify support this would be the best smart speaker on the market. If you have Apple Music I would 100% advise you to get this speaker."
5.0,3 weeks ago,Best Buy,Perfect Smart speaker for an Apple Based Home,"The HomePod is perfect for our house that utilizes all Apple Products and also HomeKit, We are also Apple Music Subscribers and the love the rich immersive sound the HomePod generates. It allows guests to use voice commands to turn off lights within our house and even adjust the temperature. Very happy with it. No issues to date."
4.0,a year ago,Argos,Great sound and works like magic but...,"Setup in about 1 minute of plugging them in, it was just like magic. I approached my iPhone to the speakers and boom. The sound is very very good and can certainly fill a room without stress. It has some cool little features, the hey Siri works well even when the speakers are playing loud. On the downside, integration with apps such as Spotify was non existent so unable to play my Spotify list. It works well with Apple Music. Spotify Integration is expected with iOS12 though."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great for music,"I was apprehensive about buying a quality smart speaker, but the overall experience was positive. The sound quality is exceptional considering I use Apple Music and not low compression audio formats. It’s surprisingly loud. A great ancillary product for music streaming. I do not use the speaker as a smart speaker exclusively, so I can not say much about that aspect, but I was surprised how the speaker could pick up “hey siri” while music was playing. It works well with basic commands."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Apple just does it right,"My wife started her own at home business. I wanted to get her an assistant for her desk that could be a speaker phone, spelling aide, and speaker for back ground music. In my research I found out that the other popular speakers do not work as a speaker phone unless the other caller is using the same system... odd This was plug and play, does everything she needs, oh the sound is fantastic by the way. Yes it may be more expensive than the best selling ones out there, but if they don’t do what you need them to do, then price doesn’t matter. It didn’t hurt that BB had them $100 off the week before Christmas!!!"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Music lover's dream,If you love music and good sound this is the speaker for you. This is by far the best sounding small smart speaker I have heard. This will fill a room with beautiful sound. It is stereo sound from a single point. There are speakers in all directions so some do left channel and some do right channel. The bass response is astonishing and is better than other larger high end bookshelf speakers I have. I now have 4 of them scattered about the house.
4.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Excellent sound quality,"Superb sound quality as you would expect from a company like Apple. Setting up is a breeze - just bring your iPhone/iPad close to speaker and all the settings are transferred. It's not so intuitive as Google Home when answering questions, and sometimes have to repeat the question or music request twice or more to get a satisfactory response - but this is just a software update and no doubt Apple will be intent on improving Siri in the future. Where this does win hands down, is the sound quality and Apple Music streaming. You don't need a CD or record player anymore!"
4.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Wonderful audio in a small package,"This product is the perfect complement to iOS devices. Speaker offers rich 360 degree audio, immersing living room areas with solid highs and lows. Small footprint, easy to calibrate and set up HomeKit. Siri works great with multiple users and iOS 13.3"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,So good I had to buy two for stereo,"I initially bought a HomePod when it was fairly new with the intrigue of a great sounding speaker in a small form factor with Siri. After months of use, I was a firm believer in how well these speakers sounded. I kept hearing rave reviews about HomePod stereo pairing, so I decided to give it a try, and boy was that a great idea. Two HomePod together is unreal. Movies sound amazing and music sounds crisp. I would recommend at least one HomePod to anybody in the Apple ecosystem."
4.0,a year ago,bestbuy.ca,Excellent Speaker.....So-So Assistant...not without limitations,"If you are looking for a home assistant, look at google or alexa because the siri on your phone is smarter than this one. If you are looking for an excellent speaker, this is top notch. I love the way it sounds, truly awesome. You need a subscription to apple music to use this, it does support bluetooth. Pointless to buy unless you are all-in with apple. Everything I got is apple so there is no issue, but for someone who visits and wants to stream their music off their device onto your homepod...it is a no go. It would get five stars if it could do this."
4.0,a year ago,Argos,Love My HomePod,"The HomePod isn’t for everyone. If you’re looking for a really smart, intelligent assistant, Siri won’t cut it! If however you own other Apple products and are a bit of a so-called ”Apple Junkie” you’ll love it. It is an amazing compliment to an Apple Music too. The sound from the HomePod is second to none. I was actually pleasantly surprised when I played the first track and heard the crisp sound that the HomePod produced. It was more like a sound system rather than a single speaker."
5.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Home pod,"I looked at a lot of speakers before buying this one and I’m so pleased I did because it makes you appreciate what a good speaker it is. The sound is very very good and it has no bass distortion due to how it has placed the tweeers and subs in the opposite way to most other manufacturers. Add in the smart features of Siri and what Apple is planning with future firmware updates for stereo speakers etc and I would suggest buy this speaker and “Buy well buy once” as you probably are future proofing your self as much as possible. Also you won’t believe how easy it is to set up, just put your phone near it and it does the rest on its own. A good product buy with confidence."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Sounds and Perfomance,"Installation is easy, just have your iPhone close and i will configure it quickly and you can being telling Siri what music to play or what information on various subjects you request. Its been a good addition to the Home, it readily controls the HomeKit Devices I have installed as well, plus the rest of the family has been using it as well to play their music or get weather, sports etc. While its not perfect, and nothing ever is, it works well, sounds great, and I believe that its more secure than other devices, plus Apple's privacy policies I think are far better than the competition in keeping things secure."
5.0,a year ago,Target,Great quality.,"I have a handful of HomePods around my house. The quality is superb, and Siri’s ability to pick up my voice without me shouting is awesome. The integration with Apple Music is solid, and setting up HomePod is a breeze. It’s a great device. I hope they eventually release an SDK so developers can build more functionality into it similar to Amazon Echo. When it comes to quality, this speaker is the best. Add a second one and you get an immersive stereo experience too."
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Great sound ease of use,"Ive been looking for a homepod for a while but really couldnt justify the cost. Then B&H sold it for $100 off list, a price lower than Craigslist so I jumped on it. When you pick up the box you know this is quality! So although Im slowly venturing into home automation my main use for it is music and I must say that between the ease of use and sound quality I find myself listening to much more music. Its so easy and I can connect from my computer, my pad, my phone or just tell it to play music! I can control it with any of these options as well including my watch! Loving every minute of it!"
4.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,So close!,"First, the sound is amazing! Set up is extremely easy, all you need is your iPhone.. I have smart home lighting setup and Apple HomeKit easily set them up and controls lights. Many other features are coming to light as I use it...”find my iPhone, routines for controlling home lights, etc. Working on sprinkler system through HomeKit. On the semi-negative side...you must subscribe to Apple Music..no support for Nest Thermostats or Nest Smoke/CO detectors...it doesn’t seem quite as smart as Amazon Echoes but is catching up... So far, very happy with purchase!"
5.0,3 months ago,John Lewis,"Jaw-dropping sound-quality, doubly-so in stereo and Siri no longer sucks",Apple's audio engineers and software writers have done an amazing job - the HomePod is the best sub-£2000 speaker system I've heard. Get two for even better stereo sound. Don't be put off by the naysayers of Siri - Apple have vastly improved Siri's performance in the last 12 months.
4.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Good value,"I purchased this HomePod for $100 off, so it was a good value at the time. I love the sound quality, how it fills the room. My only issue is that Siri picks up extraneous conversations sometimes, even when I don’t say “hey Siri”, or even anything close. I’ve considered turning it off, but that would mostly defeat the power of the speaker."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Speaker,"Works very smoothly within the Apple world. Set-up via my iPhone was a breeze. Somewhat limited for the choice of music if you don't belong to Apple Music, which I don't at present. Sound is great. It won't answer some simple questions like ""at what temperature should I cook a chicken breast"" but will set a timer and let me know the local weather . Works very well with the Apple Homekit and I can turn on/off lights easily with ""Hey Siri turn on the Master Bedroom Lamps"" or ""Hey Siri Goodnight"" and it turns off the Master bedroom lights and the downstairs lamp""."
4.0,a week ago,bhphotovideo.com,A MIGHTY SPEAKER THAT JUST GOT BETTER,"Apple has a new beta iOS 13.4 that makes this speaker work with other music streaming services, you just launch your favorite music app and tap your iphone on the top of the homepod. Now this speaker is worth the money and now is the time to buy the homepod, you will be glad you did. Oh and the sound is great and if you buy 2 you can get a fantastic home theater experience too."
5.0,a year ago,Target,Amazing sound and responsiveness,"After being frustrated with sound quality with my Alexa speakers because I use them primarily for music,I tried this one out of curiousity and was completely blown away by the sound. It’s sort of like a virtual surround sound that sounds incredibly rich, full and balanced. Also Siri hears at least 10X better than my Alexa’s. I’m surprised that often I don’t even have to raise my voice for it to hear me clearly and instantly respond with very few errors. I’m going to purchase a second one for the stereo syncing next. Yes they’re expensive, but worth every penny!"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Apple Bluetooth Speaker,"Great quality speaker from Apple. It does lack some features that the Amazon Alexa and Google Home have, but what separates this speaker from the rest is the sound quality. Excellent base from the lowest setting to 100% without distortion, as well as excellent sound quality. This speaker can connect to other smart devices as long as they are connected to the Apple HomeKit app. Once connected with the app this speaker can control smart lights, smart thermostats, and even alarm systems."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Incredible sound, flawed ""smart"" features","If you are invested in the Apple ecosystem of computers, mobile devices, home kit smart accessories, and home entertainment devices like Apple TV, then you can not go wrong with this smart speaker as you will know the capabilities as well as limitations of Siri. The sound quality and volume that comes out of this small speaker is seriously impressive. However if you intend on using anything other than an iOS device, look elsewhere and don't waste your time because this is not made for Android devices and you can not connect anything via USB or AUX port because there are none."
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Disappointed,"I pickup a iPhone and fell in love ended up replacing all the family's phones with iPhone's, replaced all Android tablets with iPads and brought the new Apple TV to replace my Nviada Shield. I wanted to replace my Google home with the HomePod but it doesn't do much! It plays music from Apple Music and supports some basic Smart Home features like turning lights on and off noting much for $350! While the sound is good the HomePod needs to do a lot more for this price. I really wanted to love it but its going to get returned and waiting to see what Apple decides to do with future updates for now I will stick with my Google Home and my Mini's."
4.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Home pod,"we got the home pod during the holidays on sale for $250. it works well with our lights and apple music. bass is deep and notes are clear, better than other smart devices. siri is fairly smart, but not as smart as some of the other ones out there. if you mainly an android or google household then this may not be for you. but if you have apple music and apple products then this works well."
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Great Product. I have 10 of them,"I love the HomePod, best sounding wireless speaker. Adapts to the various rooms well. Best for those who are hooked into Apples ecosystem. I paid full price for them when they came out and I would gladly pay that much again. This is deal on B&H. Pairing them in stereo makes for a warm, clear, spacious sound. If youre looking for a digital assistant, maybe alexa is better for you. Sound is the most important thing for me."
4.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Must have for Apple ecosystem,"Any app you can play on your iPhone/iPad will connect and play great. There is a learning curve, be patient. I wish there was a better dedicated app though. Also there is a time lag 5-10 seconds when you first turn it on. Music quality is great, if you want real sound quality separation set up two Home Pods on each side of your couch or behind you like surround speakers,"
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Good Apple Product,Easy to setup. Most of my home devices work with Apple. Use it as a Home Hub. So this fits right in. Great sounds too. So that’s good for music. Waited till the price came down because honestly it started out to be overpriced compared to Alexa. No problems have surfaced.
4.0,3 weeks ago,Best Buy,Another Good Product for your Apple Ecosystem,"I waited a while before buying a HomePod until it had multi-user support. At first it was a bit buggy and didn't recognized voices very well. Fortunately, it has gotten a bit better with the last few updates. Overall, it is a great speaker and I would recommend to any user of Apple devices."
5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Excellent speaker,The HomePod smart speaker is for enjoying music. We have 2 Echo Dots and a Google Home Mini also. This gets used the most. Our home is not fully smart yet but getting there. We love music. Amazon Music didnt have enough songs that I listened to. Never tried Google Music. I was apprehensive about spending a large amount of money on a speaker. But you get what you pay for and more. Excellent sound and acoustics. It picks up Hey Siri even at a low volume. Highly recommended over Amazon and google products.
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Great sounding speaker,"If you’re invested in the Apple ecosystem, this is the speaker to get. Not only will it be your hub for home automation, but the speaker sounds great with ample bass and volume. You probably won’t have the volume level above 50% in a bedroom. It’s worth the purchase if you’re a heavy music or podcast listener."
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Perfect for those using Siri for home automation,Picked up two extra Home Pods while they were on sale for $249.00. I have a ton of smart switches and plugs throughout my home. Have added these throughout the home. They work great and pick up voices from a long range. Price was the issue at full price. Otherwise I would have given 5 for value.
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Sounds Great, Siri Is Awful","The HomePod sounds amazing. It is worth the price just based on that. If paired with an iPhone or Apple TV, it’s amazing. Using Siri to navigate Apple Music is less so. Siri activates well, which is good. But the Apple Music catalog is just too vast and complex for it to work well with voice only navigation. Siri commonly confuses similar sounding titles and artists and doesn’t handle natural language requests well at all."
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,A great sounding not-so-smart speaker,"I have been very pleased with the sound produced by the HomePod - it's clear, crisp, and well-rounded. When it comes to its ""smarts,"" however, I have been less than impressed. Siri frequently fails to respond when I say ""Hey Siri"" and it often provides me with results that are irrelevant to my question/command. The good news is that I suspect the device can be made smarter with software updates. If you're completely committed to remaining within the Apple ecosystem than you'll likely be pleased; but if your looking for the best smart speaker on the market, you may want to consider other options."
5.0,10 months ago,Argos,Good quality home speaker,"As usual from Apple a good quality item giving a good all round sound. You can connect to your device easily with Bluetooth too. Disappointingly you have to pay 9.99 gbp/month for most of the other Siri features on subscription to Apple Music which I was not at all happy about, I should have got a google speaker really but the sound quality of this is better in my opinion so I chose this one."
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Great sound, but...","Sounds great, but if you are a Siri user and other people in your home are Siri users, think twice. Microphone works great but limits the ability to use Siri to respond to voice commands that are specific to a single users account. So I had this set to my Apple account and when my wife wanted to use voice commands to write a text it basically did not work. It is for that reason that I consider this to be an unacceptable product at this time. I’m considering the Echo plus with sub. The Echo had unacceptable sound quality so the search continues."
4.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Great Sound when using Apple,"Quality sound from such a small speaker. Over-priced at the original cost, but I got two on sale to create a stereo pair and I’m satisfied. A little annoying that the sound quality isn’t as good when listening to third-party streaming apps. Best for someone invested in the Apple ecosystem."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,"Typical Apple, pretty great","I've used the Sonos system in my house for the past 5 years, and love them. The HomePod is different than Sonos, seems to be very Siri dependent (and I'm not a big Siri user). But once I spent some time using the HomePod it became easier and the sound is wonderful. Love the look too, very simple yet functional."
4.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Better in pairs.,"This is my second HomePod, and I’ve been able to pair them now as a stereo system. Two working together create an amazing sound-stage for music and movies. I’m blown away by the difference in overall sound quality, especially with music. Apple should probably be selling these as a pair. I primarily use the Siri functions to activate HomeKit devices and scenes. It works great. The mice on this thing can hear me two rooms over so it’s easy to say a command into the air and have my lights change, music change, etc."
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,No Bluetooth,I am all in on Apple products but unfortunately the HomePod is missing Bluetooth & only uses AirPlay to connect to my iPhone. I have to turn on AirPlay every time I want to stream music & it only works with iTunes. I have an alarm app that I use to wake up in the morning & the music only plays on the iPhone & not the HomePod. I even tried using the Apple Alarm app & the audio will not stream to the HomePod. The audio quality is awesome but unfortunately it does not meet my needs so I returned it & purchased a different Bluetooth speaker.
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Great sound from a small package,We have been looking for a small sized smart speaker for a while but we were not super impressed with the other options out there. We heard one of these on display and were hooked instantly. The only downside is that we wish it could go a little bit louder at times. But aside from that the sound quality is fantastic.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Apple HomePod delivers unbelievable sound!,"This is my second HomePod. Since pairing my new speaker with the one I already owned, I have been enjoying exceptionally high-quality stereo sound that fills every inch of my family room. Everything from the initial setup to connecting the Homepods to the Home app was straight forward. This was a great purchase!"
5.0,a year ago,walmart.com,"Beautiful Sound, Effortless Voice Commands","Phenomenal room-filling sound! What's awesome about the HomePod is not only the incredible quality but also you don't have to shout at it -- try saying 'Hey Siri' at a normal, conversational volume and the HomePod will pick it up just fine (even when you're playing music at high volumes). Try that with Google and you'll probably end up having to say 'Hey Google,' 'HEY GOOGLE,' 'HEY GOOGLE!!' several times before it hears you. Great for music, great for Spotify (using Airplay on you iPhone), great for using as a speaker for your TV if you have an Apple TV as well. Highly recommended."

You will HATE the HomePod if you can put a NOT in front of any ONE of the above statements. People bash this speaker because it doesn’t try to be like any or all other speakers. Judge it for what it is, not what it isn’t. Its great adaptive sound. Voices in particular are clear. Its great with Apple Music. Its easy to set up with IOS. Its small. It blends in with the room. Its quality. Its not for droids. Sorry."
5.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Third HomePod,"Decided to pick up a third unit and created a stereo pair with two. The white looks nice (first two are black). Fills the house with clear audio and a good bit of base. Improvements to Siri has been a snails pace, had HomePod since it launched, but there have been some decent incremental updates lately."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Excellent Sound.,"I very much enjoy the sound on the HomePods. I own four of them and with the ability to sync them together, the sound is amazing. The limitations with the HomePod are centered around Apple’s Artifical Intelligence feature, Siri, which in this instance is an oxymoron for AI. I have an Amazon Alexa product, and this is much more intuitive than Siri. Bottom line, if you are looking for a very nice, compact, portable sound system, HomePod will work. If you are looking for more intuitive exchange, this may not be for you."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Very good speaker!,"The HomePod impressed me with it's audio quality, no set up needed. It can be placed anywhere, I can hear good bass but not over powering, the voices and instruments are clear even at low volume. The main thing that I don't like is Siri's too loud. It will be nice if she can be softer, that her volume can be turned down without affecting the loudness of the music. This is a nice addition for people who are already lock into Apple eco system. I have tried Alexa before and it just ended up being a paper weight."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Nearly perfect for Apple-centric homes,"HomePod has outstanding sound quality, and has everything an Apple-loving devotee would want in a smart speaker to boot. I know the main gripe is coming from those comparing Siri to Alexa and Google. In my opinion, I prefer the privacy policy of Apple and want it kept that way. Anyway, Siri does all the things I need it to do...control the lights, fans, timers. My one star deduction is that Siri only hears correctly, 90% of the time. Get that to 95% and I'd give this 5 starts. I'll be getting another one before the year is out."
1.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Doesn't live up to the hype....,"I don't know what everyone is talking about when they say ""This speaker has exceptional sound"", or "" This speaker has incredible bass"", I have tried it in a larger room, smaller room.etc. This speaker has ok bass, but nothing special. A soundbar, and sub woofer combo stomps all over this thing in terms of bass. This speaker also doesn't go as loud as I would like. Not having bluetooth is a major no-no for Apple. I like the marshmallow design, but cannot justify keeping this for $350. The reason being that it has average sound (for the price), and Siri is severely lacking in capabilities compared to Alexa. Air play also seems to cut in and out at times with the homepod. I have an Ipad Pro, and an Iphone 7 plus (both of which I love), but they missed the mark with the homepod. Back to the store it goes!Less"
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Beautifully crafted machine,"Packed beautifully, it’s an Apple product but even the plug had its own engineered cardboard to hold it in place. The plug wire is lovely too, more like cord. So simple to set up and I am more in love with Siri than ever! He even turns the lights off! The sound is very good but not wildly better than the bose sound link which this replaces in the kitchen. Siri does have his moments when he gets the wrong track but I forgive him instantly! We are in love!"
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Works Great with Apple Products,Have all Apple products (IPad iPhone MacBook etc) and it works seamlessly together. Connection and ease of use are very good and sound is great considering it’s a small speaker. We also have Bose and Amazon speakers which are good but with Apple products it always seems this is our go to speaker because of connection and convenience.
5.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Superb,Some reviews have been critical of the sound quality I don’t Have any issues with the sound quality at all Siri yes is limited but that will improve with future updAtes the thing is the HomePod is more secure than sonos so I trust apple more with the fact it won’t be listening in on my conversations but the speaker is always listening as soon as it detects hey Siri I can talk to it I don’t have to be right next to the speaker either I can be upstairs and still chat to it when in bed I have a small house 1 bedroom terrace house very small so I do not need two of these I’m very impressed with the sound quality very impressed I would say buy it and from John Lewis it’s worth it for the 2 year guarantee! Best money I’ve ever spent and I have no issues with the sound quality! I say buy it! But you must be an Apple user won’t work if you aren’tLess
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,One of Apple’s Best Kept Secrets,"In terms of playing music, setting timers and alarms, and much much more, the Home Pod is simply the best. We have 4 of them in pairs. As we walk from one room to the other, it is impossible to detect any change in quality, volume, or anything. Space tech :). Once they go mainstream on things like lights and switches it will dominate the market."
2.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great sound lacking everywhere else,"I want to start by saying that I am a huge Apple product fan. I have been for years so when I saw this come out I was pumped. But now that I’ve had it for a while I hate it. Half the time it doesn’t connect to my internet, it turns on and Siri talks randomly with no “hey Siri” command. I’ll stream music from my IPhone to it and that constantly drops off. I will say that the audio sound when it works is phenomenal but paying $350 for a speaker is silly. Apple needs to work on making this thing better. I say stay away until it’s improved."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Amazing sound! Great with HomeKit.,I now have three HomePods brought my home. I also have a Sonos Surroundsound system I love that they all work together. The HomePods also act as my home hub for HomeKit compatible devices I literally can get into my house but using my watch or allowing someone to get in by simply telling Siri to unlock my front door. Been able to ask Siri to do different things around the house from turn on lights to set different scenes or play music has been amazing I can’t wait to get a few more to give me a whole house music.
4.0,a year ago,Argos,Best Little Speaker for Sound Quality,"For sound quality you won’t be disappointed in this little speaker. The speaker seems to know what volume would upset the neighbours & caps the maximum volume before this happens. Great for community living. However, if you’re having a private party in a secluded area, one little speaker is unlikely to be enough. Using Siri can be fun, but after you get bored, you just want to use your iPhone phone as it’s quicker and more intuitive. Unfortunately Siri is not that smart & needs improvement."
5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Nicer sound than Sonos,"Too many want to discuss its value accepting verbal commands. IT'S A SPEAKER. The sound is full at low to medium volume and vastly superior to the Sonos Play1 and the Sonos One that I already own. The bass is pumped up at lower volumes but the end result is very pleasant. I will be phasing out the Sonos products and replacing them with the HomePods. For serious listening, I have larger speakers and a powerful amp but for casual listening, I will be using these."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Lovin it!,"So glad that I did not believe some of the negative reviews. I love this thing! Understand, I am in the Apple ecosystem. I have approx. 40 GB of music ripped to my iTunes library, and music purchased from Apple. All of it is in the iCloud. I also subscribe to Apple music. That said.....The sound is outstanding. Set up was so easy. (I'm mid-60's, so often new tech stuff can carry quite the set-up time for me.) 2 minutes and I was rockin out. I can play all of my music, even stuff not on Apple Music, although I read you can't do that. I specifically asked Siri to play an album that I knew was not on Apple Music, and it worked. Perhaps because it is in the cloud. Bottom line, I'm diggin it!"
4.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Amount the best sounding smart speakers.,"The Apple HomePod is among the best sounding smart speakers for music. Although it is limited to streaming Apple Music, you can play anything via Bluetooth from any of your devices. Siri is there to answer most questions and perform many tasks. A real buy if you can catch it for $100 off as I did."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Sound and Microphones,"Sound quality, setup process and microphones are great. This thing can hear me over just about anything. The only issues I have are when it picks me up and I don't want it to. I prefer to do timers with my Apple Watch since they are quiet and unobtrusive and frequently the HomePod will pick up that command. I rigged up a bunch of Homebridged smart devices (including my TV and Sonos speakers) and it controls them all pretty well. Excited to see how this evolves (and it really needs to if Apple wants to stay competitive) but even as is I don't regret the purchase."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Amazing sound, improving Siri usefulness","This is hands down the best smart speaker out there. I’ve tried almost all of them and live the sound and functionality from HomePod the best. I actually went back after a few weeks and got a second one and the way the two speakers manage stereo sound together is fantastic. I look forward to listening to music on my HomePod and it’s great for parties, too. Meanwhile, Siri is getting better and more useful and apple is quickly adding device compatibility."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great speaker,"Firstly, I knew exactly what I was buying. I knew going in this wasn’t a smart speaker, I knew it wasn’t a Spotify player, I knew it wasn’t an Android player...you see where I’m going with this. This is a speaker for an Apple Music user, who is embedded in their HomeKit ecosystem. Point is, I knew what I was buying before making the purchase. The sound is great from such a small package, even compared with my various Sonos models. I use it more now than my Def Tech home theater setup. If you know what this product is and who it’s for, I would suggest buying one."
5.0,a year ago,very.co.uk,Great Product!,"As expected of Apple this is a well built product that sounds fantastic alone and even better as a stereo pair. If you own AirPods or the latest Beats products then you'll understand just how easy pairing is with your Apple product. The moment it starts up your greeted with a lovely deep chime and then your iPhone or iPad will show a screen that a new HomePod is located, after clicking connect it sets up and pairs your HomePod... within minutes you'll have your music blaring and Siri ready for your commands. Siri is able to hear you from anywhere in the room even when music is at 100%."
4.0,4 weeks ago,John Lewis,"Looks good, great sound quality.",We bought this for our parents as a joint birthday present after buying one for ourselves. I would say the downsides are the lead is very long so unless you hide it somehow it’s quite bulky sat on the side and you can’t play DAB without an app on your device connection to the pod. The sound quality is brilliant and it does look good.
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Amazing sound,"Terrific item - for the price, sound is second to none. Really amazing when used as a stereo pair, but that gets a bit costly. Siri will improve over time & is still behind the Echo for smart assistant functionality but that is all software. The hardware is just perfect & the software will improve with updates. If you are in the Apple ecosystem then you will appreciate the quality. If you like cheap and cheerful then go for an Echo but if you want better sound quality, it’s homepod all the way."
4.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Do I really need a complete sound system?,"Answer.....NO! I love the quality sound and the richness of the bass! It was so easy to set-up. Just plug it in and place your Apple device close to the HomePod an enjoy your favorite tunes! The only complaint I have, is that you cannot link SiriusXM. Overall I rate the system a 5 however, I am giving a 4 because of the SiriusXM."
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Great sound quality,"This product was super convenient for me because I am an Apple Music user, was looking for great sound quality, and some basic smart speaker features. If you would rather have better smart speaker features, I would look elsewhere. However, I love this product and would recommend it to anyone looking for a great speaker."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Best In Clasd,"As many reviewers have said, the sound quality is amazing. It is small, solid, can get loud without distorting. That alone would be worth the purchase. However, the way it interfaces with the whole Apple ecosystem is flawless. If you have Apple Music get this speaker. If you get this speaker, get Apple Music. Additionally it works great with Apple apps such as Notes. iMessage. Calendar. And so much more. I am bought into Sonos to the tune of several thousand dollars, however the HomePod is getting me to rethink this."
5.0,2 weeks ago,Best Buy,"Great sound, make Siri commands from far!","Have two of them in our house now and as an Apple Homekit connected family, the HomePod is a natural fit. Easy to set up with the Home app, and with the microphones built-in, using Siri is a breeze. Multiple user support for Siri is critical, and we use it every day from weather questions to alarms and timers."
5.0,7 months ago,John Lewis,"Fabulous sound, quality product.","The sound from this is excellent, and if you have a n Apple Music account, the whole household can use it. However, check the settings on your phone because someone could send a text message, have insight into your calendar without your knowledge. A bit of a lapse in security from Apple. Otherwise I’m very pleased at the sound and quality of this product."
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Good sound quality for what it is.,"Been using AirPlay 2 with a few Airport Express and a multichannel amplifier (5 Zones) and needed something for the kitchen and this works great for it. I’m more concerned about security and privacy than functionality plus with Airplay 2 it was a good choice. Had a google home and even though google is (in my opinion) smarter, privacy and sound quality were big factors in choosing this speaker."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Sound is Amazing!!!,I purchased two HomePods for the stereo pairing. The sound is the best of any smart speaker on the market still to date. Pairing is simple and I love the Siri integration. I have my Apple Music subscription turned on and is all I have to do is ask Siri to play something I like. Airplay 2 is awesome as well. Can control volume and everything else from the iPhone now. Highly recommend this to anyone who is into quality of sound type speakers.
5.0,a year ago,John Lewis,This Pod Rocks,"I first set this up in my kitchen and was initially disappointed with the sound. I then moved it to my lounge and the HomePod sounded fantastic with tremendous bass. Back to the kitchen and it began booming under my units so having heard about it calibrating itself I gave it a slight wobble so that it realised it had been moved and about 2 seconds later the HomePod reduced the bass and gave a great sound for the location. I wonder in some of the poorer review, the HomePod had not calibrated itself properly. The HomePod always sounds great in every room now."
4.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,"Great sound, solidly made, but too limited on music services","I like everything Apple and love the sound quality and build of my new Home Pod, but I am disappointed on the music services you can use on it. I know Apple wants people to subscribe to their music service, but I wish they had made their Home Pod open to competitors like Pandora, iHeart Music, etc. I dont care to subscribe to Apples more expensive music service, so Ill be limited to what I can do with it for now. Hopefully, Apple will come around and add more services to their device. Im glad I bought it at a $100 discount, otherwise I would be sending it back."
4.0,a year ago,Target,Good sound for the size but expensive,"Great sounding speaker for the size and much better with two in stereo. However, minus one star because I think the regular retail price is too high... $700 for a pair of these is too much. $500 is more reasonable and I'd say $400 for a pair is a good deal. I'm using a pair of HomePods to AirPlay SiriusXM and Amazon Music from an iPhone SE. Oh, don't place any iDevices to close to the HomePods because I think that has caused me problems (speakers dropping out) because they connect to each other and possibly enter some type of ""setup"" mode like you use when you first set these up."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great speaker! perhaps better than Bose,"I was hesitant to buy this because let's face it, like most Apple products, this one is expensive as well.. But I love the sound of this speaker... Apple really did a good job here. At least so far it's been working great. It can reach a very high volume without distortion. Siri is very attentive and it looks nice too. Very happy with this purchase. Oh and you get 3 months of Apple music free too"
3.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Love. Hate.,"Soundstage is incredible. Especially as a pair. I believe subscribing to Apple Music is a must for this product. I find the bass to be a tad bit too punchy in my estimate. Wish there was a way to eq the speakers. I have a pair at my desktop. They will not play in stereo when streaming anything outside of iTunes or through an Apple TV. . YouTube from computer...Nope. Netflix from computer...Nope. Also, Compared to my Echo Siri is remedial. Simple commands for playing/pausing and skipping Podcasts/Music can become insanely frustrating."
5.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Great smart speaker if you own other Apple product,I have tried Sony Sonos and Bose. I’m more interested in the sound quality over everything else. This surpassed many other speakers I tried. It’s bass heavy. Works well with all my Apple products. It’s not my number 1 for sound quality but it’s in the top 3
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great sound,"The Apple HomePod is amazing for its music listening experience, simple Siri tasks and controlling HomeKit items. I’m looking forward to the updates that will mature Siri. Siri capabilities are basic at best. Siri that lives within the iPhone is more advanced than the one that lives within the HomePod. But having Siri always listening within HomePod is so great. To start music so easily, or control HomeKit items on a whim, is very convenient. I’m happy with HomePod!"
5.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,This joker...,"Talking about bass... this joker tops them all! The sound is so clear and precise. And a plus, you can have the volume up, be across the room, and Siri will still hear you enough to get the music turned down very quickly. We can be in our bedroom and call out to Siri to turn off the lights with Homekit, and it hears us. Yeah, it sounds scary, but it’s the future. This is what we’ve wanted, and Apple has delivered."
3.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,"Audio is fantastic, Siri is meh","If you're in the Apple Ecosystem, get a HomePod. It sounds great and works with all of your Apple products. Siri is a bummer, though. In addition to being useless most of the time, she often gets activated from people talking on tv and for no reason at all. Still recommend it if you use Apple Music."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Hey Siri,"I bought a HomePod when it first came out and was disappointed that it was JUST a speaker and not at all smart. Years later I’m giving it another shot. Best Buy had the best price by over $100 difference. Now that the HomePod has Siri functions, it’s definitely competitive to Alexa and Google with better sound quality."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,White Apple HomePod,I love my HomePod I purchase this one first and then I went back to Best Buy and purchased the gray Apple HomePod 199 a piece on sale on Black Friday. I pair them together and they sound awesome. Then I separated them and they still sound awesome they make my life so much easier I have a couple of smart home products that I have initiated with them I would definitely recommend the Apple HomePod.
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Feel like I was tricked,"I bought my mom two of these for Christmas, and she loves them especially that they can hook together and work as one as a stereo system. But I was also promised a gift of three months of free Apple Music, And when I went to redeem it, I was given a telephone number to a recorded message saying they had run out of activation codes and didn’t know when they were going to get more. I was really excited about the three months free so that my mom could try out Apple Music To see if she liked it before she had to purchase a subscription without knowing what it was. If You can’t deliver on your deals and incentives, then don’t offer them. I have a bad taste in my mouth about the whole thing."
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Very Happy,"I am impressed with how well the base sounds and fills the room. I use Air play to listen to pandora but I notice a difference in the Pandora music if I download the songs from pandora rather than stream them. The songs that are digital download play really clean and sound, safe to say Amazingly well for such a small unit. Siri works well to. shes not as dumb as Alexa. The home app works really well as well. Im glad I bought here, I save $120.00 buying it from BH."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Multi-Room Sound,"Had some difficulty setting this up as there is a known issue with Apple two-factor authentication that needs to be addressed, but after finally getting the HomePod setup, the sound is amazing, even at low levels. The device does a great job at putting a sound stage right in front of you no matter where you are & Siri hears your voice over the music level & is very responsive. I do not think Apple has quite caught up to other smart home products in some features, but for music the HomePod is hard to beat"
5.0,a week ago,Best Buy,Best speaker,If your looking for a great speaker that you can use for music or watching tv then this the speaker for you. If you have Apple products such as an iPhone and TV if you got at least these two devices then your experience will be completed. Even though at launch HomePod did not have much going for it now with some updates more features have been unlocked to make it so much easier to use.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Excellent sound quality!,"I purchased this to pair with an existing HomePod. I now have twice the listening pleasure. The range of dynamics is fantastic and the audio quality is top notch. Excellent sound with a full low end and clear mids and upper. works great with my Apple TV, iPhone, and as a stand alone audio source."
3.0,a year ago,Argos,"Sounds amazing, but......","Great sound from a tiny package. Delivers a good level of base. It hears your voice well even when playing music at high volume. Controls my hue lights well.. very easy to set up. However.... it is quite possibly the dumbest smart speaker in the world! Can’t believe this was also launched without Airplay 2, stereo or the ability to control an Apple TV. Dolby Atmos - Nowhere to be seen! Unless you are an apple die hard (like me) or a sound snob, I’d give this a miss and opt for Alexa or Google."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Great sound, locked ecosystem","The sound quality of the speaker is phenomenal. However, you need to be deep in the Apple ecosystem to fully enjoy using the HomePod. Apple Music support only, no Spotify, no direct Bluetooth connection, airplay only. There are quite a few features that need to be added that are coming in future software updates, so, if you don’t have all Apple products, this isn’t necessarily the best choice. For those deep in the Apple ecosystem, it’s a great device."
1.0,10 months ago,BLINQ,Having internet problems before setup even starts!,"Just received the Apple HomePod. With my iPhone, tried to set up the HomePod. Gave ERROR WITH CONNECTING TO INTERNET. No QR code to scan for device identity, no documentation included. Apple help online does not give me any clues. WHAT TO DO BEFORE applying for a RETURN? Thanks, Jim."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Superior Speaker,"I purchased the HomePod with intentions to return the device if it did not meet my expectations as it is quite expensive. After using it for less than 2 minutes I already knew it was not going back to the store! I have a Google home I've been using since Christmas and I compared the two alongside each other and was very surprised at how much superior the Apple HomePod was compared to the google home. The sound quality from the Apple HomePod is unbelievable compared to the Google home, and I thought the HomePod was even more responsive than the Google Home was. As for the voice assistant I do know that the Google home has more/better capabilities than the HomePod does, but I simply believe the capabilities the HomePod has are plenty good for the average user. I'd recommend the HomePod not just to Apple users but to anyone interested in a home speaker/ voice assistant as well.Less"
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,"Amazing sound, Siri could be better","I have to say Apple did an amazing job working on the microphone detection and sound output. The quality of the sound with separation of sound levels is amazing for this system. My biggest peeve is that Siri is missing some basic functions that she should have. She should be able to unlock my front door but because the microphone system is too good, she can’t for security reasons. She also can’t answer any internet based questions. Apple should improve her responses to questions that would be “googled”."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,"Everyone is right, it's Insanely great for IOS","I am not going to fully repeat the positive reviews, they are right.. amazing sound, adapts to the room, phenomenal ability to hear your voice commands over any volume of music, easy to set up, easy to operate. Much better than Alexis in that regard, and better sound than Sonos. The haters are also right. They are they ones that give it 1 star and have not actually even heard the product. But they are right, it doesn't works with Android (only Apple Products), its NOT a bluetooth come one come all speaker, its NOT cheap (quality costs), and its NOT stereo. It was designed to be NONE of those. So yeah if you are going to hate something for things it was never designed to do.. without even hearing it.. go for it. I wish I had enough money to put one in every room."
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Sound is fantastic,I found the acoustics beyond any of my expectations. The speakers optimize for their surroundings. The sound is rich and full across the spectrum. There is no tinnyness and the base approaches the quality of my Cornwall Klipsch speakers which I couldn’t physically place them where the Homepods are. I am glad to spend the money for such quality sound. I think the acoustic optimization makes this product exceptional. I plan to buy more so to have music through out the house.
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Nice speaker,"Great sound. First time I'm really using Siri and it's great to ask how many teaspoons in a tablespoon, set timers, ask what the weather is etc. But not sure what it really can do beyond that. Got it for a really good price though so we will see. Definitely not disappointed, but I don't think I would've been happy if I paid full price for it."
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,"One was great, two is fantastic","Apple HomePod might not be the top seller, but its by far the best sounding smart speaker. I loved my first HomePod but two HomePods is even more amazing. Bass is pure and strong, vocals clear, and the volume can get incredibly loud if you want. This is the best smart speaker for sound quality and Siri keeps getting better with every update. A little pricy, but worth it if you like great sound reproduction."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Im getting a Third,"This speaker is great for the Home. You must have a recent IPhone or I-pad to set it up. Get Apple music. Apple music is free for three months and is great. Ok- now the pod, yes its new, its apple and it will blow you away. More features are coming soon, so don't let the apple haters tell you its not worth it. I love the sound that comes out of the little speaker. Its heavy and that's a good thing. I have always been a fan of small speakers. You know, a small speaker that you can just put out of the way and forget that its there. You wont forget this speaker. When you turn it on, you will know its there and wonder how they did it. It is a stereo speaker and will direct 5 channels (yes 5.0) in all the directions as needed in the room. It uses an A8 apple processor (same as in the iPhone 6) to make it smart. It learns the room that its in and knows where to fire the sounds. It has a Accelerometer. Why you ask? It uses a type of Accelerometer to determine if it has been moved to help in directing the sound. I'm getting more and looking forward to the new features to come. Thanks apple for this great product.Less"
5.0,11 months ago,Argos,Great and powerful sound - super easy connectivit,Great product if your interested in a smart speaker that is great at being a speaker. For my need (hands-free music playing in the kitchen) it's perfect. Very easy connectivity and great to control your music by simply saying what you want. *Voice control needs apple music
4.0,a year ago,Argos,My HomePod is awesome if a little flawed.,This is a quality piece of kit. The sound is amazing. It’s powerful but crystal clear and if you have Apple Music is an absolute doddle to use and listen to practically anything you throw at it just by taking to Siri. The only problem though is that at the moment Siri isn’t really good for much anything else but that should be resolved with the new ios12. It sounds better than any other smart speaker on the market by far and I’ve tried them all. It’s a bit pricy but worth every penny. I ❤️
4.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Outstanding sound,"Better sound quality than the Sonos play 1, but the Sonos app is much easier than the Apple Music app. For the price of the HomePod you can get 2 play 1’s and make a stereo pair which sounds great. HomePod doesn’t get as loud as the Sonos. If the HomePod was cheaper and louder I would give it 5 stars because you can’t beat the sound quality."
1.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Very disappointed with this HomePod,"So I bought this speaker as being an Apple Fan but honestly it is the worst! We need a smart speaker not just a good sounding speaker. There are many speakers in market you can get play good audio but for that I have my stereo system. This speaker is merely a speaker, siri is so bad in this I dont know why. Returning it soon. Don't see any value for 349 price. Suggestions: Apple please make detachable power cord next time. Open bluetooth restriction so all devices could connect. (It is now has bluetooth 5.0 but works with apple devices only lol) your product will sell more if you open bluetooth for all devices. Put a 5000 Mah Battery to make it portable use. It will sell like hot cake (no one has done it yet not even google)"
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Lives up to the hype and then some,"This is the best sounding smart speaker on the market hands down. The sound is crisp and clean and the bass is deep but balanced to perfection. Warning...this speaker only works with iOS devices and you need an Apple Music subscription. Here are a few great features: 1. Siri works great for music searches. 2. Siri will read and reply to texts hands free. 3. Siri will give you current traffic and tell you how long to reach a destination. 4. You can use the HomePod with AirPlay to hear the audio from movies, games, or control Spotify. 5. Siri gives you weather info and sports info including current scores. Bottom line...the HomePod works as advertised with Apple devices and services. This smart speaker is for audio and not for shopping by voice or making calls like an Amazon Echo.Less"
5.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,The best quality in a smart speaker,Such a fantastic sound. Having two of these is out of this world! Using it for Apple TV (while the volume is a bit low) has been a real treat. It's great for unplugging and just wanting to hook it up when a party is here. Fills the ENTIRE room. And our living room is huge!
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great but not without flaws,I’m a die hard Apple guy and have been since the beginning. I feel this is one of the first products pushed out to soon. I give if 5 stars for sounds and usability for one person in the house hold. I give it 1 star for using it in a family home. I knew the issue before buying but I think this is a simple programming fix that they should have handled before release. You can not use family share with the HomePod. Only the person that setup home kit has control of the HomePod.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,GREAT sound and integration with Apple ecosphere,"Sound is best out there for smart home speakers so far. Siri is playing catchup to Alexa and Google BUT Apple will continue to improve and eventually catch up or surpass the others. IF you are all in with Apple, this integrates with your Mac, iPhone, iPad, iPod, Apple Tv seamlessly. Now you can connect two in stereo for a home theater experience. I have two of these now - recommend waiting for the sales when they drop to $249 or less for best value."
5.0,8 months ago,Argos,Sound for enthusiasts,"- superior 360 sound quality, nothing quite like it. - great use of Siri for music intelligence, HomeKit usability and personal requests - [Upcoming September software update] Multi-user support, with Siri improvements - [Upcoming September software update] Handoff between iPhone and HomePod for music and calls (personal favourite) HomePod can do a lot when you’re in the Apple ecosystem, and much more when future updates arrive, it’s a product that will and has improved over time."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,AMAZING SPEAKER,"Definitely a must have speaker for your home! I have a loft overlooking my downstairs living room and the speaker fills the house with crystal clear music, everything is balanced, highs, mids and lows. Siri works very well, not yet on Alexa’s level unfortunately, but a solid number 2. Where the echo falls short the HomePod blows its doors off. I use this more than my Bose system and you can’t tell a difference. Great Product!"
4.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Superb at the right price,"Purchased both second hand on eBay for 250 which I believe is the correct price level for these wonderful speakers. Siri integration is just right for music listening and not much more at the moment. However its music first for me as I wanted audio quality in a non intrusive package, multi room and works with Apple Music - these are perfect. I have had a Sonos One and much prefer the audio of the HomePod as well as looks and the feeling of more privacy (I just dont trust amazon or google as much as Apple (thats why you pay more)) Enhanced Siri + 50 RRP cheaper and these would be 5 stars!"
4.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,This is NOT a home assistant...,I am an APPLE die-hard but I never would have bought this if it wasn't on sale. The setup couldn't be easier. The sound blows the doors off of almost everything else. Great for FaceTime audio calls with family. There is no worthwhile home-assistant value though. It's laughable how far behind Apple is in the field.
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"As advertised, but...","A fine Apple product--impossibly easy set-up, outstanding sound, etc. but not fool- or goof-proof when it comes to pairing with the iPad and iPhone. And it's dawned on me more than once that if you're not using it for ""smart home"" functionality and using it purely for a volume and sound quality boost, there are probably (okay, definitely) more economical options to be had. Not quite experiencing buyer's remorse (optimistic that an enhanced usefulness will develop as I use it more) but as close to it as I like to be. The Yes recommendation I'm about to give next has some qualifiers, obviously."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Amazing,If you’re encompassed in the Apple ecosystem this is a no brainer for its Black Friday price. The ease of use with Siri and Apple Music is through the roof. It’s seamless. Regardless of which ecosystem you subscribe to the sound from this speaker is top notch. Clear as a bell with a nice thump of bass. I love it!
5.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,I’m inlove!,"I was a little scared to purchase the HomePod, but once I seen the price Best Buy had, I had to get it! This is the best sound I’ve ever heard from a speaker! And the fact that I can use it as a sound bar on my Apple TV is even better. I love how I can tell siri stuff including turning on/off my lights. The only regret I have is not buying it sooner!"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Love to the max!,"I thought I would test this product out and potentially return it as I wasn’t entirely convinced. That being said, I loved the HomePod so much that I bought two. It has enormous sound while being able to Airplay music from our devices with ease. I use Siri everyday to set cooking timers, control my lights, locks, etc. Though I tend to get 80% accuracy with my requests, I’m not bothered. Often, when Siri fails, it’s because I didn’t speak clearly or made an ask that didn’t make sense to the programming. Anyway, LOVE!"
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Buying My Second One...,"Enjoying my first one so much, I just ordered my second. Let's get some of the hyperbole out of the way and address the pluses and minuses objectively... 1. This is a fantastic sounding compact/smart speaker. It is not the end all/be all of speakers. For its size and purpose..yeah..It's great! 2. The homepod is meant for room filling sound and does it VERY well. The HomePod actually sounds better the more you move away from it as it analyzes its surrounding. Listening close to it in a store will not show off its audio capabilities. 3. Siri easily detects your requests without shouting. 4. It works very well with Homekit in controlling smart home devices. The Minuses I'll lump them all together. Siri is not so smart, promised functionality at launch are not there ""yet"", voice recognition would be great as well as making calls from the speaker. I could go on. It's just impossible to not add any one thing that can't be addressed with software updates. Some will come sooner. Some will come later. Some may never come. Bottom line is the hardware is exceptional and the software good enough that the HomePod will continue to improve over time. Five+ stars as a speaker/music player, 2.5-3 for smart capabilities. Solid 4 as it now stands overall.Less"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great sound quality and it always hears you,"I got this as a Christmas present and have loved it so far. The sound quality is amazing and it is loud. If you are an Apple fan you will NEED one too! But you need to be deep in the Apple ecosystem (Apple Music, iPhone, iPad, iPod) because you can not ask Siri to play music from Spotify or any other music service than Apple music. Also you will need an Apple product to set it up. The best part is that it can hear me say “hey Siri” even when the volume is way up."
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Good only if...,I purchased one a while back and placed it near a wall and it sounded great. I moved in a central area with no walls and the sound was disappointing. I purchased a second one and placed it in the same central area and the sound gave me chills. It was soooo good. Bottom line is you need two or more. I purchased one for regular price but got the second one for $250. I think it is over priced since you have to get 2 of them for great sound. This item also worked on Netflix.
4.0,2 weeks ago,Best Buy,Awesome Apple HomePod,"I purchased the Apple HomePod (white) from the Best Buy store in Kennesaw, Georgia. We love our Apple HomePod! It totally Rocks!! Thanks Best Buy for 16 years of great customer service, dedication and support, Sincerely, A satisfied Best Buy credit card member for 16 years!! T. Wells MSN, ARNN, FNP"
5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Great sound!,"To me the most important part of a speaker is the sound quality. I am not so lazy Im unable to bring up the Amazon web site if I want to buy something. I was very concerned if there could be decent bass not to mention volume out of such a small speaker. This speaker exceeds my expectations. The sound is some of the best Ive heard. I still think you need two for stereo. But with all the processing of the sound field available today, one could probably get a pretty decent imitation of surround sound."
5.0,6 months ago,Target,"Great speaker, but...",The Good... HomePod has excellent bass and consistently superior sound quality across a wide variety of music genres. The speaker is easy to set up and Siri can hear you from across a room. The Bad... You're stuck with Apple-only audio services when using voice commands and the HomePod only works on iOS.
5.0,2 years ago,Argos,The HomePod changes how people listen to music,"The build and sound quality of the HomePod is almost unmatched, yes the Google Home Max gets louder and has more bass. But it disorts at higher volumes and has nowhere near as much clarity and audio separation. This speaker is not for people who use android as you need an iOS device running iOS 11 or later. Spotify does work on the HomePod (with basic voice commands such as pause, play etc) just not the “what song is this” or “play something I’d like” Overall it’s an amazing speaker"
5.0,8 months ago,samsclub.com,Good purchase,$30 off from Sam’s Club is a good find. I started my Apple Music 3 months free trial. I like it. The sound is nice. I move it around with me; such as working in garage on a project for two hours. Great to have HomePod there. Or use it upstairs then move it downstairs. Depending on where the people are.
1.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Setup is terrible,"This is the worst product setup ever released by Apple. Utterly bizarre and unhelpful error messages, like 301009 setup failure. Apple Support is clueless if something more than restart is involved. It took several days of messing around with network settings and having to use an unconventional work around. Based on my experience and high level of computer knowledge, Apple HomePod is NOT ready for prime time."
1.0,3 weeks ago,Best Buy,Stayed in the box,"For the cost, I expected this to have some basic connectivity capabilities (as a TV speaker, etc.). The ecosystem is still far too narrow for me. I love that it protects your privacy far more than Alexa and other smart speakers, but its limited connectivity is a major negative. It went back the same week it arrived."
4.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Excellent sounds for the Apple eco system,"Very good, easy to forget the technicalities and just enjoy the music. Very versatile and plays all music types well. Recent price drops make this more competitive with other products. I find it sounds best in a small/medium sized room with good damping (carpet or curtains, etc)"
1.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Not what i expected,I was excited to purchase one of these. I did. As soon as I got it home I had problems with the set up. I'm familiar with Bluetooth and associated devices. The sound is really average for the size. I have another device sounds much better. The Bluetooth is more reliable too. Finally Siri is awful...way behind other devices of this type. I'm an Apple owner too. I own everything Apple. This is not their best effort
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Whole home speaker system,We bought one and were able to play in conjunction with our main stereo using Apple TV. Bought two additional speakers to have music playing in multiple areas during parties. Good sound and easy to operate from phone. Hope they introduce other sizes.
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,"Great sound, but lacking in features","If you considering this speaker, you've probably already read reviews or watched reviews on YouTube. The speaker sounds great! There are smart features there, but not nearly as much functionality as the competition. These features will come with software updates, just like Google Home which launched with a lackluster skill set. Fortunately for me, I'm not that concerned with asking Siri a bunch of questions...although making a call or adding items to my calendar are head-scratchingly missing. (Yes I made up a word!) If you are in the Apple ecosystem, this speaker will be a great addition. Some might want to wait for software updates to add more functionality, but why wait...it's not going on sale (this is Apple)."
3.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Good Product but setup can be tricky,I have enjoyed the HomePod once I get it setup and working. The internet connection was a issue to get setup but once that was sorted out it's been mostly simple. I do think people need to read about what they are getting before the purchase. It can do many things but if you must have time to spend getting it working correctly.
5.0,3 weeks ago,Best Buy,Great One for the Collection,"Recently we decided to purchase the HomePod. Coming from the google home mini, this is heaven. The sound is so deep and rich, that any type of music is a delight. Also you can sync it with all your smart home devices and SIRI help you turn them on or off. Definitely a good purchase."
3.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Amazing sound but Siri needs improvement,"Easy to set up and get Apple Music working. Had to resort to calling Apple to get other tasks - eg set a reminder- working and currently very flakey. You get a message to say that the HomePod needs to be on the same network. Apple have assured me that the next iOS update will improve stability- we’ll wait and see. If no improvement, it’s going back If you’re hooked into the Apple world have Apple Music and want really good sound then you can probably justify this but the whole iOS intergration if still flakey"
5.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,HANDS FREE EVERYTHING!,"No more getting up to turn on or off lights. Need lights brighter? Tell siri. Weather outside? Ask her? Change the thermostat in the house, she has got it. Very nice addition to our new smart home. If your an apple user this enables you to do some much more."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,OMG!!! Amazing!!,"OMG! The apple HomePod really sounds amazing. I mean it is clear, loud and the bass is just Awesome! I ended up buying 2 of them, one for my downstairs and one for the upstairs. I do not have any smart home/ HomeKit stuff, so, I mainly bought this as a speaker. I have Apple Music, and my husband wanted something a bit different (or better) than my Bose Soundlink Revolve +. The HomePod was the answer! IT blows my Bose speaker out of the water. The whole family is really enjoying this, I like that as I am the only one with an iPhone that the rest of the family can still use the speakers if I am not at home. I really have been impressed with my new HomePod speakers. I really think you should give one a try. Selling my Bose on eBay now! IF you just remember that the HomePod is an amazing sounding speaker first and foremost you will be happy, I promise! I am new to apple, and I love apple products. You pay for quality!!Less"
1.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Do not buy.,"I am a huge apple fan with pretty much every apple product, so I had to get this HomePod to add to my home. I hate it. Yes, the sound is good, but Siri is terrible. The speaker basically functions as a music speaker and nothing more. It can control home functions of course, but It can't make calls for me, can't check or update the calendar, can't search the internet, blah blah blah. Hoping that they come out with some updates for this in the near future, but for now, hold off. Apple has really fallen behind since losing Steve."
5.0,a year ago,very.co.uk,HomePod,"I brought this for 2 weeks and I already love it, the sound Quality is amazing, already looking to but another one. Sira works fantastically, he/she can hear you over the music you playing just incase you need to turn it off or if you want to change songs, or if you want to make sira turn up or down the volume. You can every make sira play your favourite radio station and there all other bites you can make them but I haven’t figure them all out yet The only thing I would say people might not like is that you kinda need Apple Music to properly use it because sira will only play music for Apple Music but you can stream any music for your iPhone from any app."
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Amazing Sound,First and foremost I love the sound quality that comes out of these relatively small speakers! The way they equalize to the rims acoustics is awesome. Im tied into the Apple infrastructure and as you would expect it does a great job with my other devices or by itself. I have my music library on iTunes match so the speakers can play my playlists or any of my music library by voice command. My Apple TV sounds great through Homepod also.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"If your considering it, just do it","I was very on the fence about purchasing a HomePod, but after purchasing it I can say I am not disappointed. If you are bought into the apple ecosystem, this is a great addition. While some will say that Siri isn't as skilled as Alexa, the bottom line is Siri can do anything you really need on a day to day basis. Only the gimmicky Alexa skills are missing. The sound quality also far surpasses any of the current Alexa offerings, even the Sonos options."
4.0,a year ago,Argos,Much better speaker than Amazon Echo or Google,"As for the sound and general look of the speaker it is better sounding and looking than its competition. Much better sounding than any echo available and a fair bit better than googles speakers and sonos speakers. Apple did market this as a speaker first...with smart functionality but as an echo owner I haven't found many if any restrictions when using siri. Siri can hear me from any room in the house and always has a well spoken response to all my questions on news, weather etc."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Wonderful addition for Apple centric,"Wonderful sound in lrg room w/area of 2 stories. Hey Siri has been quite good for creating and adding to lists/reminders, timer, all music related (who’s playing, favorite, add to playlist etc,), questions like where is Black Panther playing, of course weather. Siri responds to very low volume command-amazing. I will probably buy a second Homepod when Airplay 2 is available-both for stereo and to move occasionally to second room. I will add a 5th star after Airplay 2 I expect."
2.0,a year ago,Argos,"When it works, its great.","When the home pod works it sounds amazing. However, it doesn't always work. It relies on Airplay 2 which is really unreliable. Sound would pause and stutter halfway through a song and sometimes connection would be lost entirely. The other issue is the lack of a Equaliser. At low volumes the base is overwhelming and nothing else can be heard. That say, when its all working and at higher volumes its by far the best sounding speaker i have ever heard."
5.0,a year ago,Argos,I love the HomePod! It sounds amazing!,"The HomePod is amazing! The bass is crazy and it goes incredibly loud! This would be perfect for a house party for example or even a chilling speaker for the back ground. Also if you have Apple TV you can AirPlay the sound to the HomePod and have a great sounding Speaker System for watching TV. Also a cool little feature is that when you move it, it knows, and senses the environment to adapt the sound to its surroundings! Pretty sweet speaker!"
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Fabulous sound!,This was my second purchase of a HomePod and I am delighted to now hear my music in Stereo. I thought the sound was fantastic just using 1 HomePod but the Stereo pairing is AMAZING & so simple to set up. Only downside is that Siri functionality remains limited but that’s more a Siri criticism than a criticism of the Speaker which I highly recommend!
4.0,5 months ago,ebay.com,Perfect but requires iOS 13 & Shortcuts!,Youll need to put in some work setting up automations and customised Shortcuts via the Shortcuts app to make this truly smart. But it is a drop-dead gorgeous speaker with amazing sound for its size and price. I would highly recommend it as a Home Hub too if youve got some smart devices like lights and Apple products!
5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Fantastic sound! Okay functionality.,"First generation Apple products are always limited, and the Homepod is no exception. That said, sound is remarkable, Siri is convenient and connection to Apple TV, MacBook and iPhone is easy. I'm assuming Apple will come up with better Siri functionality, because her usefulness is far behind Alexa and OK Google. If not, this is just a good speaker. Sonos connectivity would be killer useful."
5.0,a year ago,Argos,"Excellent sound, great connectivity","Small, but produces a very rounded and listenable sound - much, much better than any of the Amazon devices, in my opinion. Connects effortlessly to our Apple Music subscription and will happily send its output to other Airplay 2 compatible devices. We regularly throw the sound from the Apple TV box in the lounge to the HomePod in the kitchen (useful if you just nip out to put the kettle on), and vice versa. Excellent product, would strongly recommend."
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Insanely Great Sound - Good Siri!,"The sound on this little speaker is absolutely amazing. It is quite immersive! Siri is great, too, and can hear my commands even when I'm talking in a normal voice down the hall when the music is blasting! It's a great addition to my home entertainments system, which includes an Apple TV."
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Apple homepod,"Very simple to set up and use(providing you have iphone etc) and yes it’s good for music if you subscribe to itunes. quality of music is very good would rate it on pare with bose. But with more base. can’t get full enjoyment with it till airplay 2 is released. on its own is good but if your after that stereo sound will be better with a pair. Siri can’t answer a lot of questions yet, but hopefully will improve as time goes buy. it’s an apple product, bit pricey but excellent build quality."
4.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,A best sounding dumb speaker,"The speaker sounds awesome with clarity and great bass. Pair it with another homepod and it sounds even great. Its nowhere near Google with respect to smartness, the speaker is very dumb. Also be ready to pay $$ for Apple music as it doesnt work with any other music services."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Excellent quality if you want a smart speaker,"This sounds really really good for such a small package. Nice and heavy. My only issue is that I just don’t seem to use the features often enough to justify keeping it as my iPhone connects to my sound bar. That said, if you know you’re a smart speaker user, this is the best I’ve heard!"
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,"Big sound, easy setup.","I love the Apple HomePod. This is my 3rd one. I’ve got them in living room, game room, and now master bedroom. Super easy to setup using your iPhone. You do need to pair it with an Apple Music subscription to get the most out of Siri. Super clean, only a single power cord, and it sounds awesome."
1.0,a year ago,Best Buy,worst on everything except sound,"do not buy even if it has the best sound. It has random connection issues with iPhone. Also doesn’t play the latest songs from apple music, today is 1/29/2019 if you ask Siri to play the latest album from Julia michaels it will play the album from last year. What good is a smart speaker if it can’t play the latest music that we’re paying subscription for and it doesn’t work with Spotify. No wonder apple stocks are down."
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Another amazing product from Apple,"At first I was on the fence about buying this product having heard mixed reviews, however being an Apple fan boy I simply needed to get one. It was a brilliant decision. The set up process is so easy and happens automatically (as long as IOS device is nearby). I can play my apple music by asking Siri without touching my phone. The sound is the best in class in my opinion. It’s mainly a speaker for music at the moment, however with further updates it will be great for smart home."
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Awesome sound - Great design,We have 3 at home - a stereo pair in our living room and one in our bedroom. Great for people like us who own Apple products and use Apple Music subscriptions. However - Siri is no match for Amazon’s Alexa or Google assistant - and I would not reccomend the Apple HomePod for those who don’t use Apple music. It’s great for use as a speaker for iPhone - and works with calendar for appointments and reminders.
5.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Love it with the new update,This is our 3rd HomePod!! 2 in the dining room and 1 in the bedroom.. absolutely love the surround sound of it. And with the new handoff mode and siri knowing who’s who.. the HomePod isn’t locked to just one account anymore!! May buy more in the future! Thanks Apple for another great product
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Its like I have a new set of ears!,"Small, demure, and packs a punch! The bottom line, our collection of classical, jazz, vocals, rock, R&B/Soul, electronic and pop all sound refreshing new! I look forward to asking Siri to play some song or album that hasnt been played in a long while. Truly a refreshing experience. And asking Siri to run a HomeKit operation is super fast! Im thinking of getting a second one to feel and hear the wider stereo. Very happy!"
5.0,a year ago,Target,Love these....,"At this price, buy two. They will seamlessly synch up and provide you with awesome sound......plenty for the average home. After a couple weeks use, I have noticed that Siri begins to recognize your preferences and when you say: ""Siri, play some music"" you will have hours of music played in your particular genre. I absolutely love this but I am a huge Apple fan. It has a way to go to catch up with its competitors as far as home management but I am confident Apple will succeed, as always."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Well worth the price tag,"The amount of quality that has gone into this smart home speaker is second to none. The sounds quality is amazing and I can literally in the other room and use my normal speaking voice and it listens to my commands perfectly. And speaking of listening, Apple HomePod only records or listens when you actually say “Hey Siri”. They only use those recordings to make their product better and then they delete it. This is so much more comforting than Google or Amazon which record all the time and use your conversations for Ads to other companies"
2.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Not so smart,"1. You have to be an Apple music subscriber. 2. Will not work with other music apps (Pandora, Spoti). 3. Will not work with other platforms (Android). 4. Does not understand very well what we say. 4a. Makes up phrases that it thinks youve asked 5. Heavy! 6. Obnoxiously long power cord. 7. Not a portable. 7a. Not battery powered 8. Inconsistent sound with Apple Music. 9."
1.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Disappointing,"As an Apple aficionado, I was expecting great things. I wanted a speaker/s capable of producing good quality sound from my Apple iMac. The sound quality for music was extremely disappointing, and I was surprised to read, for stereo sound, just add another one!!! I have returned it, and bought the Muso Qb, which sounds wonderful, albeit it, at twice the cost. I would not recommend this product, but, of course, different people have different uses and expectations."
4.0,a year ago,Argos,"Very good, but just on issue for me...","The speaker looks good and sounds great. For me it is all about sound quality and I’m fully in the Apple eco system so no issue with compatibility with other streaming services etc. My one issue though is that the bass is so good, even at very low volume, that I can very rarely allow it to stretch is legs through worry that it will annoy the neighbours (we live in a semi detached with 1 wall separating the front rooms of both houses). Just wish Apple would let you control sub output!"
3.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Great sound bad fitting,"Give 3 stars because its 199. Hardware has bluetooth but can't use as a bluetooth device. The sound has delay with some apps. Why should I pay for apple music, it is worse than spotify and costs a lot. If you cant make apple music well, you should fit other music."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,"Awesome Sound, Voice Recognition","Great replacement for the Bluetooth speaker I had been using in the kitchen. We have a family Apple Music subscription, and the HomePod is clearly designed to deliver that content in a beautiful, fantastic sounding package. It’s so easy to use the device really just gets out of the way and disappears while filling the room with sound. Setup took 30 seconds at best (after updating my phone to the latest version of iOS which took a few minutes). All in all super happy with the purchase. It’s pretty amazing that Siri can perfectly understand everything we say, considering the differences in speech between my youngest children which are in elementary school, and myself and my wife. Kudos to Apple on designing a great product."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great sounding speaker - will only get better,"Very very nice. Very compact and looks great. Delivers 360 sound unlike Sonos and Google Max which are the only speakers that can come close to the sound quality. It picks up Hey Siri very well. I am 100% entrenched in the Apple ecosystem so I have Apple Music, etc... I do wish you could adjust the sound settings. The bass can be a little heavy at times. Overall very nice speaker."
1.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Not a Home Run,The setup and pairing is easy enough but it frequently loses connection and requires a total reset. It’s frustrating to deal with and it doesn’t fully solve any of my sound needs as it only connects to Apple devices and doesn’t have aux input or anything. A great one to one device but not helpful otherwise.
5.0,2 months ago,John Lewis,Apple Homepods,"Amazing product, so clever. You need to be signed up to Apple Music or something compatible to get the best from the speaker. Reasonably easy to set up if it likes the device. We tried with an iPad and it didn't like it but an iPhone worked fine. You probably need to Google the instructions."
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Best home speaker!,The sound coming out of this speaker is truly amazing! It's really amazing what they have been able to do with such a small device. My only complaint is Siri. It's not the most reliable assistant... Hopefully they will keep improving the HomePod with future software updates.
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Perfect for Apple & Music Lovers,"This is a great home system. The music quality is awesome, and Siri works very well for me. I can set an alarm, timers, ask Siri to play different types of music for me, and the weather. It’s a good size for the room, and doesn’t overwhelm/underwhelm the space."
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Fantastic Device,"I bought this HomePod to replace my Bose Sounddock ll, I was a little apprehensive about the sound quality compared to the Bose but I must admit it produces a fantastic quality sound. It was so easy to set up, and other household members can airdrop their music to it. Siri is very responsive even when the volume is at 100%, Siri can pause, resume, skip, repeat music and increase and decrease volume. Although the HomePod is more expensive than other interactive speakers it surpasses them all."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Its quite awesome!,"If you use Apple Music, and/or have an extensive playlist this IS awesome! I never really understood the purpose of Alexa, the HomePod is really built for music lovers, like we are. I received mine 2/9 from the preorder, we have been learning and testing it for the last day. If anyone says setup is hard, they are trolling, this is by far the easiest thing I have ever set up, bar none Sound quality is exceptional for the size. I have a 25 x 25 living room with 21 foot ceilings, and the speaker sounds nice. For the size of room, if I had 3-4 sync'd I think it would rival my home audio system. Siri can easily understand commands at a normal speaking level from quite a distance. Ignore the low star ratings, they have not listened to or seen one yet."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,HomePod-first Smart speaker.,"I recently switched from Windows to everything Apple. It’s nice to have all my devices in sinc. The HomePod sounds great. I’m able to play all the music on my Apple library. I don’t have Apple Music so my music is the only choice. I can stream radio . Siri is quick and responsive but still very limited on the HomePod. I get weather, time, and snarky answers to limited questions. I bought it on sale. I’m having fun with it."
1.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Biggest piece of trash Apple has ever created,What a disappointment. Great sound but the device does not want to cooperate with AirPlay. All i wanted was to play music. It only wants to play music from the iCloud and Apple Music. This thing is geared toward making you an Apple music subscriber. Im a huge Apple fanboy. This HomePod is pure garbage. Buy a bluetooth speaker and forget this thing
4.0,5 months ago,bhphotovideo.com,If you like bass Homepod is for you.,"I ordered one and the hardware was defective. I returned it to B & H and it was a great experience. I received the second one and it set up very quickly with IPhone, IPad and my PC ITunes. This all works with WiFi. I does not support Bluetooth. It has great sound and bass, just ask my neighbors."
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,I bought it for the sound,"Love how this works with Apple Music and Airplay. I didn't need it to turn lights on or change the temperature in my house. I have apps for that. The Google Home speaker, which I gave away, could not compare sound-wise to this one. Buying a second one for upstairs in my home. The new pricing makes it a great deal."
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Lacks other streaming services,"Nice speaker with great sound. It only supports Apple music, which is ridiculous considering you are paying $350. Competitors support Spotify, Pandora, Google music & even Apple music. I would've given this 5 stars if it supported more than Apple music."
5.0,a month ago,Argos,Stylish and does evertyhing it claims to do,Sounds great. Looks great. Pain to set up as just got new I phone as well. Im still not sure why. In retrospect make sure Apple music is installed on I phone before initial setup. Im sure it isnt difficult but if your not techy get someone who is to do it.
5.0,7 months ago,Target,"HomePod is great, if you have a decent router and know what you're doing (HomeKit / Apple Music / Siri /etc)","I love my HomePod. Only negative is Target gave me an Open Box item. I really didn't have time to go through the returns and all that process. Luckily the HomePod inside the open box, is pretty brand new looking. (Maybe refurbished even)"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great music speaker,"No interest in a device that can give updates on the weather, what’s the traffic like or other mundane topics. But I did want a wireless speaker with great music reproduction. The apple HomePod fits that personal need. I am 100% happy with the sound the device delivers. Ease of operation and have yet to have Siri not find one of my music selections. I am excited to see where apple takes the HomePod going forward."
5.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Best in home speaker,"Upgraded from the echo dot and I have to say, the HomePod is a must have. Easy to set up especially with other Apple products. Very responsive and the sound quality is out of this world, deep bass and crystal clear sounds through the speaker. Definitely would recommend."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Worth the price,"I also have an Amazon Echo. The big distinction to keep in mind here is that if you're looking for a smart assistant/speaker whose primary focus is voice commands, the Echo is the one to have. If you're looking for something to actually play music through with great sound where the voice commands are the interface, the Homepod is night and day better. Looking forward to getting a second one now that you can link 2+ and have them sync for greater stereo."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great sound. Very good speaker!,The Homepod is an excellent speaker for listening to music. Interactions with Siri also are very helpful and useful. At full volume the speaker sounds super clear and doesn’t distort the sound or bass and just delivers great quality
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Sound for the Price,"Most people will think its expensive but for the sound quality you get without having to run an amp and wiring to speakers it will be as good as it is going to get. Simplicity is excellent, and if your buying this speaker your buying it for Apple Ecosystem, great sounding speaker, and then Siri. Siri is not as smart as Alexa or the Google Assistant but for most things it is just fine. If you playing jeopardy on the speaker most likely this is not the product for you."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Excellent With Even More Potential,"I first awarded this product four stars, but realized I was holding the product to Apple standards, and were it made by someone else I would've given it five, so I changed it to five. Awesome sound with one caveat I'll mention at the end. Very accurate with voice recognition, the whole package. Wish the software update was out to make a second HomePod stereo. The one sound caveat previously mentioned is that on certain songs the sound is so bass heavy that the bass sounds unnatural and the mids are masked a bit; overall it misrepresents the song. That problem is precisely why I don't own the even more problematic bass leaning Beats Headphones. Overall highly satisfied with the HomePod."
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Amazing sound - great price from B&H,"The sound of the Home Pod is as great as advertised. Full bodied with deep base, the HomePods self adjustment makes it sound great in any room. Siri works about as Siri works, but the HomePod can hear hey Siri using normal voice anywhere in the room. If you are looking a great sounding bluetooth/wifi speaker, this is it. Think of the Siri functions as a bonus."

5.0,2 years ago,Argos,HomePod Sounds Great,This product does require an IPhone or IPad to activate it with the newest firmware. HomePod is then ready to use within a minute of activation. When you play music you can immediately tell how good the quality is and at 100% volume there is no distortion. Other requirements are a subscription to Apple Music if you don’t have it all ready. Many reviews dis Siri for not being as smart as it’s competitors but the point is Apple got the hardware right and there is time for software to improve.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,LOVE this thing!,We have really been enjoying this speaker. The sound is incredible. It also can hook into Apple TV and provide you surround sound. Siri actually listens to us and can understand us. She can change the volume a little bit or you can tell her a percentage and she will reduce it by that amount. You can also change the volume manually but she will listen to you and react which is nice. We are super happy with our purchase.
4.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Awesome Sounds - Room for Improvement,"The speaker sounds amazing but I wish Apple provided the to customize the EQ and add integration to Spotify. With that said, it is a great alternative to Sonos if you are a dedicated Apple Music fan. I just AirPlay from my phone. Good value at the sale price."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Great sound, integration is lacking",Apple’s homepod is an awesome speaker and having Siri is great. It works great with the Apple TV and you can even control the tv by voice when connected. It does lack with integration with anything not HomeKit enabled. But I do believe that will change when Apple opens it up to everyone else on a software level vs the current hardware. Make that change and this might just be the best smart speaker.
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Best compact speaker I’ve ever heard,"Have listened to the HomePod for several hours with the family and we are all blown away. Apple made an amazing speaker. Setup was flawless (and cool!), Siri can hear us at normal voice volume even when she’s playing the music at 100% (“Hey Siri, who is this artist?”) and the sound is wonderful. The separation of musical instruments and vocals is almost unbelievable in a unit this small. The bass won’t rattle your teeth like my SVS subwoofer, but it’s not an exaggeration to say that it delivers chest-thumping bass relative to its size. Going to see if we can return my wife’s Echo and pick up a second HomePod for her. Cannot recommend this speaker any more highly."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Excellent sound - even better when paired.,"This is my second HomePod as I was eager to test the stereo functionality. Other than a required update on the new HomePod, pairing was easy and now the sound is amazing. Stereo music segregation is flawless. I’m very happy with the double setup."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Excellent home speaker and assistant,"Not sure why the press is stating it is selling slowly. Sure, Amazon Alexa products and Google Home products have a wealth of resources to ask from but Siri does answer what I ask it the majority of the time. The sound is immersive and not too overloaded with bass or treble. It’s easy to set up and you can either use Siri to play music or your device. It’s a great addition to one’s home."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Such an amazing piece of hardware!,Was skeptical at first about this but pulled the trigger and bought this and wow I am amazed of how great this speaker is sound quality wise and build quality is top notch. The HomePod will have plenty of future updates and lots of further oppotunity. Apple wanted to perfect this speaker sound quality and took over 6 years building and perfecting this. And in later software updates it will get even better. Siri can be limited at times but will continue to grow. Remember this device is strictly for people who have the Apple ecosystem around them. The sound quality of this speaker at any volume level will blow you away and is worth the $349 price tag itself. Get it!
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Amazing sound,This HomePod speaker has amazing sound. Great addition to your apple ecosystem. It's very pricey but you can tell it's great quality by the sound. If you're looking to buy this speaker i would suggest waiting for it to go on sale as the $350 price tag isn't worth it.
1.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Many compromises and lack of compatibility,"The HomePod is not ready for prime time. I foolishly thought this would replace my Echo. But it currently doesn’t work with the Harmony remote, so I can’t control my television with voice commands. It doesn’t control my Nest thermostat or Dyson air purifier. It won’t play Pandora and doesn’t allow Bluetooth connections, and it won’t play the CDs I’ve loaded into iTunes or songs purchased from Amazon—it will only play songs purchased directly from iTunes. The restrictions are ridiculous. I don’t care if it sounds better when it does almost nothing I need it to. I’ve been a huge Apple fan all my life, but this is a big miss."
1.0,a year ago,ebay.com,AirPlay2 has huge lags. macOS integration is half-assed. Siri is too primitive to work with Spotify.,"Stereo mode works only in iOS. On macOS a pair of speakers is visible as two mono speakers. Switching is slow, flaky, and audio playback has a huge lag. Nothing has substantially improved with AirPlay2 update. There's no integration with Spotify, and Siri in general is useless."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Sounds good, but not as good as in the store","I purchased two of these, but so far activated only one of them. The sound quality in the store seemed to be better. The one at home doesn’t pump out as much bass, as the one in the store. I did go to iTunes and made some adjustments which helped some, but I still think the store unit was more impressive in the lower range. Nevertheless the small speaker provides good sound, and looks kind of cool."
4.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Amazing speaker!,"I have this speaker for almost an year now and I still love it. Amazing sound. A plus point is that you can airplay music which is great compare to bluetooth. Airplay don't drop the music when you go farther away from the speaker. Also, the bass of the speaker is amazing."
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Great compliment to my other Apple Products,Was hesitant to buy reading some reviews but I’m glad I took the leap and purchased. It doesn’t have a screen to show you visually things like the weather and news but it does have Siri. The sound quality is amazing for music playback. I’m definitely satisfied.
2.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Mediocre Sound,"I do not get all the positive reviews. I mean yes the sound is going to be better then an echo or google device, but overall the quality is just average at best. The volume doesn’t get that loud, the bass is audible, but lacks presence. Mid range seems a bit muddied at times. Siri doesn’t respond unless I’m right next to the speaker. My five year old Bose sounddock speaker sounds worlds better by comparison."
3.0,a month ago,bestbuy.ca,Strange music,I’m not sure what to make of this HomePod. Most music it plays is not something I listen to. I have to be very specific in choosing a song. I’m not sure if this is worth the money and the additional cost of music per month. I was told it should get to know my style of music over time but so far it ihas not. It discourages me to use it.
5.0,a year ago,Target,"I bought this during the holidays at a discount. Sound is excellent. Microphone picks up voice (without the need to shout) even while music is playing. It has a nice aesthetic. Works well with Apple music and various Apple devices. Siri is much improved. I like to ask Homepod to read the news, turn on certain lights set up on Homekit, give the weather, set timers, etc. It's a reasonable value","I bought this during the holidays at a discount.

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great purchase $100 off sale.,Purchased just after Christmas for $249. $100 off normal price. Not the smartest of home automation kits but a great speaker. Siri is very limited. This fits my needs as it’s primary use is music/tv speaker. It has smart home capabilities. Sound quality is excellent. Actually purchased 2 and they are paired in my bedroom for great surround sound.
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Surprisingly Satisfied,"I was on the fence about purchasing the HomePod. Didn’t really have a need for it, but purchased to give it a try AND I LOVE IT! I had a Bose Soundlink that I used for pairing with my phone, but I can connect my phone to the Hompod and also my Apple TV to use instead of a sound bar. The sound quality is great and I like the design of it."
2.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,its ok for a small speaker,"If you are thinking of replacing your current home audio speakers (such as 5.1 systems) for these speakers, think twice. The audio quality is good, but far from other systems like Bose. The AirPlay is really a bad limitation not letting you connect any other audio source, such as TV sets. In summary, its a very expensive audio system for Apple lovers, but not a real audio solution for wireless connectivity."
4.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Amazing Sound,"At $349, this speaker is just too expensive for my taste. If you looking at this as a smart speaker...way too costly compared to the others. If privacy is as much as a concern of yours as it is mine....this would be the way to go. I am really enjoying this speaker in my home office while I work. The sound is amazing."
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Works great with Apple Music,"I really enjoy the homepod ownership. Works flawlessly with Apple Music, PC desktop computer with iTunes, all apple devices. Sounds great anywhere in the room. Now with the lower price, it’s a must grab. I recommend it with Zero hesitation."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Apple ecosystem keeps getting better!!!,"With the latest OS.13.3 you can control all your apple devices (iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch 5 and Apple computers) and the integration of HomePod. I can control my home from my Apple Watch 5 virtually from anywhere in the world. The sound is amazing and the response is much faster than Alexa."
5.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,"Its definitely delivers AUDIO first, Siri is Siri","These thing is small, but delivers an unexpected punch. Voice are perfectly replicated, to the point where it can seem the artist is in the room with you. The Bass is present but not over bearing it sits nicely in the background. In terms of audio quality it sits unmatched"
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Great Sound,"Was caught between the sonos and HomePod. I decided HomePod as reviews regarding the sound were encouraging and I was already a subscriber to Apple Music . When the unit arrived setting up was really easy , just plug in and away you go, The home app on iPhone and ipad connect to the device without issue and connectivity was simple The sound is absolutely fantastic, great immersive sound that is far better than the sonos speakers. Interactivity with Siri is ok, limited on features"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,5 Stars for sound quality,"Best sounding small speaker, and we have several brands in our house. It’s quite impressive! Also, it’s great as a home hub, letting us automate some lights around the place. I never thought I’d have a smart 80-year old house. Siri gets 4 stars. But, that’s probably because I’m not good at phrasing my requests. I don’t have any better luck talking to my car and it uses Android for its system."
1.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Brand new Home Pod without life,"i purchased my 1st brand new Home pod. when i plugged in i could not see any white light or any response from Home Pod. i called Apple Technical support, they could not figure out what the issue is. i am very upset with this Homepod. Need to return this and replace with new one."
5.0,a year ago,Argos,HomePod review,Really pleased with my purchase. Amazing sound and so easy to set up. I have Apple Music which is virtually a necessity if you get this. It can stream Spotify or other music via airplay from your iPhone or iPad but having Apple Music will make this speaker a lot more useful. Recently purchased some Phillip Hue lights too and the HomePod works seamlessly in telling it to turn my lights on and off and changing colour. If you’re in the Apple Ecosystem I highly recommend.
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Sounds very good....,"The sound is excellent, but it does not have enough power like the Soundtouch 30. What made this device not a good choice for many people is that it cannot connect via Bluetooth to non-apple products (like a Samsung or LG TV). No wonder it's not selling as well as it should. Apple has to change this."
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Great product,"The best sounding speaker for the price. Siri has gotten better with software updates. You buy this for the audio quality, not so much the smart speaker part. I have two paired together for a real life experience (like surround sound). Buy it on sale, you won’t be disappointed."
2.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Not what I was looking for,I was on the search for a speaker in this price range. I figured i would try Apple Homepod since I have other Apple products but i was greatly dissapointed. You have to use the home app for everything which is annoying. No bluetooth. Really? The speaker is always listening.
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Smart Speaker for Apple Users,"If you’re embedded in the Apple ecosystem this is a great speaker. Not as smart as Alexa, but Siri is respectable for common requests. I bought this as a music smart speaker for my Apple Music subscription and it sounds amazing no matter where I put it, I’m very pleased. Hopefully software updates will expand Siri’s utility, as that is a major drawback, in addition to the lack of third party integration (eg. Spotify)."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Awesome Speaker,"This speaker is awesome! It has a very clear sound to it and gets very loud. Me and my wife have it in our kitchen as it’s the center of the house for us and you can hear it everywhere you go in the house when turned up loud! Connects to my iPhone so I can change music easier. But the talking to Home pod is what makes it cool. Hands free device, works just like Siri. Love it will definitely have this for a very long time! Apple has done it again!"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Big Sound, Small Speaker","I love this multifunctional speaker. Great sound for such a compact unit, gives Bose a run for its money. I love being able to tell it to turn my lights on and off. The only drawback is when there is anything on tv that says “Hey Siri” the speaker will perform what it says."
4.0,a year ago,ebay.com,"Excellent sound, subpar features","Of the three smart homes I have used (Alexa, GoogleHome, and HomePod) the HomePod has BY FAR the best quality sound. Excellent bass, midrange, and highs! The negatives are that it does not recognize many other apps yet. If you tell HomePod to play Spotify, it will not do so, you have to physically go in and select it on your phone and then click the device you want it to play to. I know this is not very hard to do, but Alexa & GoogleHome both do it on command."
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Love it.,"We really like our HomePods! Great sound, integrates well with your Apple products and set up is so simple it’s crazy. We use two of ours as paired sound with Apple TV and sound amazing when watching Netflix etc. just select them in the audio menu on your Apple TV. I recommend getting a pair of these."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great product,"This device sets up very easy. Make sure you are on the latest version of iOS before you begin. The sound quality is by far better than others. Looks great as well not a plastic speaker. With air play I can use with any app, Pandora, Spotify and Apple TV. Siri seems to also respond well. The only ask I have for apple is to have Siri start my Apple TV if I ask for a movie. If you read other reviews that are dated prior to 2/9 I would ask you to report them as they were done prior to the release date. These are just haters who wish android had quality products like the HomePod. Again, great product for anyone who is an avid apple user."
5.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Great sound and has gotten better with updates,Sound amazing specially with 2 of them on Stereo mode. Now I’m thinking getting one more for the bedroom. I like controlling the Hue lights with it. Or say turn on my Apple TV. I hold off getting them before but I regret waiting that long!
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great sounding....but overpriced?,"Being a huge Apple fan, I knew I would eventually purchase the HomePod. It’s great sounding and makes a good assistant. However, the $350 price tag is a little steep for a good speaker with a few commands. It won’t even make calls (yet). An Apple fan like myself may get the most out of it. But to the average consumer, the Sonos One with Alexa is a more affordable speaker, that sounds just a great."
5.0,11 months ago,bhphotovideo.com,Life improvement made simple,"The combination of a HomePod (or a stereo pair) and an Apple Music subscription allows a music lover to experience abundance beyond the wealthiest people on the planet, living or dead. Whatever you want to hear, whenever you want, with Great Sound! Super Convenient! I couldnt be happier."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"HomePod, well Integrated for my Voice & my iPhone","One thing to say about HomePod, it's the one I needed to reduce seeing the iPhone screen. I dictate, speak, play, ask Siri to read and the sound is simply superb for my music no matter whatever format and language. It's ease of connectivity, communicate, converse is commendable. It brings smile in the Living Room. What do I miss - connectivity to my Windows Laptop and Smart TV. Thank you Best Buy, the deal was nick of time with $100 discount...it was the deal of the Thanks Giving for me."
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,The HomePod are great!,"We have five HomePods throughout our condo. They work great for Hey Siri commands to our HomeKit network to control our lights, fans, and thermostat. They sound great and it’s awesome to be able to play our selections from Apple Music to individual rooms or to all speakers simultaneously. Highly Recommend!"
4.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Fantastic sound quality,"Felt it was slightly overpriced compared to its main competitors but the quality of the sound does outperform others . Find that some of the simple questions I have asked ,it is unable to answer , whereas a quick search with the basic search engine on my phone comes up with good answers . The ability to answer my iPhone , read and send texts is very useful . We have used it a lot as a reminder and alarm service . Although I feel it is overpriced I do understand it is future proofed unlike others on the market and perhaps might save me money in the long run ."
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,"Amazing sound, but Siri is still limited","I enjoy that this product is perfectly integrated into my Apple universe. Siri is responsive, but she doesn't do any new tricks that she's never done before. The selling point here is sound quality. It's about as good as it gets."
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,HomePod is my go to for home audio!,"This is my 4th HomePod and distributing them around my house make for an amazing music experience. Every room is filled with sound. The bass and clarity are amazing. Are they a little pricey? Yes, but the recent price drop (and Best Buy sale prices) help make the purchase more palatable."
5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Nice and small and takes place of whole stereo system.,"Excellent product. I do wish it could be louder, but under most applications, it's loud enough. I'm surprised seeing other reviews that it had too much bass, but I haven't heard this, and if anything doesn't have enough bass. I do like that it multi-direction unlike its competition that is directional. other products, speakers you have to place them just right, but this you really don't since the speakers are 360."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Great Smart Speaker,"Love the Apple HomePod! I like the fact you can make phone calls from the speaker, control volume, music etc without ever having to leave your chair. It was really special when Best Buy had them on sale for $100 off retail. We liked it so much, we bought two of them! Highly recommend!"
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Sound quality is outstanding,Yes it is expensive but the sound quality is better than any other speaker I've tried. You will hear instruments and sounds in your favourite tracks you have not heard before. Siri responds to voice commands from the far side of the room when the speaker is playing at 100% volume. The TV is never on any more - the HomePod is the first thing activated after a days work - expensive but worth every penny.
4.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Decent,I originally bought this a few months back when it was $299 and returned it days later because I didn’t think it was worth the price.. about two weeks ago it went on sale for $199 and I bought it again. It has some glitches and can be frustrating at times when it doesn’t want to connect.. sound is good. It’s slightly worth the $199
5.0,8 months ago,Overstock.com,"We have an Apple centric house, the HomePod makes it complete, the only problem is, just one of these isnt enough. They are such a great addition to the HomeKit setup giving us the ability to turn off or on lights just by speaking, ask for weather reports or play our favorite playlists, A new update is coming in fall and they will only be better for it!","We have an Apple centric house, the HomePod makes it complete, the only problem is, just one of these isnt enough.

4.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Great speaker,If you have Apple devices this would be a smart purchase to achieve its seamless connectivity in playing Apple Music. The speaker is excellent quality and provides fantastic sound. The downside is that it still lags behind in other non Apple smart devices.
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,excellent smart speaker/home hub,"We love the HomePod, our HomePod is the central control for our smart home. We use it for music and phone calls. We have purchased multiple we like it so much. We feel much better about an always on device from Apple over Google and Amazon and the added price is worth our privacy."
4.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Great value... ready for Apple Music,"Good weight and sized right for living room side tables, with great bass and range. Ready for Apple HomeKit integration as your hub, and perfect for Apple Music... radio stations, ambient sounds, and multi user support now available with iOS 13."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Best sounding single speaker on the market,We love the HomePod and its integration with Apple Music. The sound is fantastic even at full volume. It is especially handy for the kids that are too young to have a phone but love listening to songs in the basement. Tip: the Home interface has a setting that will not allow Apple Music to play songs with explicit lyrics so the kids don't accidentally play NWA...or at least they play the clean versions:).
5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,The best sounding home speaker,"This is perfect for what I need. It sits in the corner of my kitchen and the sound is truly awesome. Clean, balanced and full. We all know that Apple is behind on the voice assistant, Siri, so its not that good for actually assisting you but that will improve with software updates. Its also limited in how you can connect to it - Apple devices only. But if youre ok with that, it works a treat whether Im in the room or outside."
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Great sound!,"This is my second HomePod... I decided to go stereo, and I'm glad I did! The sound coming from these two little cylinders is amazing! Siri works quite well from the HomePod and I find myself using it more each day than our Amazon Echos! Price is a bit steep, but in the end, you get what you pay for!"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Amazing Speaker,"I was honestly hesitant to purchase a HomePod because of the price. But after finally purchasing one and having it for a few weeks I am obsessed. The sound quality is amazing, and the simplicity of telling Siri to play a certain song, artist or genre is fantastic. With the new update the HomePod can now be used for surround sound and can play off multiple speakers in the same room or off all the speakers throughout a house. I cant wait to add another HomePod."
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Nice hardware but need better software,"I like the sound quality and form factor. It feels like a premium product, but the software (iOS) falls a bit behind other intelligent speakers (such as Alexa). I really wish Apple would give more attention to this product to fully unlock the potential."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Music, information and multitasking","I use the Apple operating system on my phones, watch, TV’s, IPads, Music (Apple Music, SiriusXM and Amazon Music) and now my SECOND Apple HomePod!!! This device, coupled, with SIRI speech control and Apple AirPlay, allows information inquiries and/or music access with a simple voice command. Lastly, HomePods are mobile and fit any room. Music is clear and playback totally at the listener’s control!"
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Great Speaker,I waited 2 years to buy this speaker because I own a Bose SoundLink and a Bose Mini and could not justify buying another speaker. When Apple lowered the price that was all the justification I needed. This HomePod speaker out performs both of my Bose speakers. I am very satisfied with this purchase.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,A nice addition to my home,"Purchased the HomePod very reluctantly after it was discounted $100 for Black Friday. I will say, I am glad I did! This speaker is being used in my home as a sound bar replacement with my AppleTV. Sometime the Apple TV will get disconnected (this is easily resolved by holding the “play” button on my Apple TV remote). After the last 3mo of continued use I am giving this product 5 stars on the basis of sound quality, ease of use and Siri integration."
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Excellent sound!,This speaker has such a fresh and beautiful sound! The bass is deep and powerful for how small it is. I bought this as a companion to another HomePod for the stereo sound and I am more than pleased with how rich the sound is. If you are into audio you need to have this speaker.
3.0,2 years ago,John Lewis,A long awaited disappointment,"Sorry to say this is a poor choice of product for apple to debut. For £30 extra, you can get Two far superior Sonos Play ONE units as they are currently on offer for £50 off when you purchase a pair! The Apple HomePod sounds dull compared to other brands. 360 sound is a gimmick that simply does not work. How many buyers will realistically have a power point in the middle of the room to take advantage of this sound dispersion? So against a wall or in a corner it goes where reflective sounds increases the audio problems. Fanboys & girls of Apple will no doubt look over all of this and still desire it."
5.0,2 weeks ago,Best Buy,"A must for Apple Music, great sound small package","Top notch quality audio for most users, you should have an Apple Music account. Nothing beats the simplicity, the Apple Music tie in, and the audio quality all in one. Recommend for Apple die-hards. Great if you can buy it on sale."
2.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,"Sound, yes. Useful, not so much","Call me uninformed, but somehow I hoped this would play just about any audio I wanted, including from the videos I produce and want to show clients. It seems to be restricted to playing only from iTunes, and even then Siri cant play my playlists, although they will from my computer. If you have an Apple music subscription, then you are better off. It does not work as a bluetooth speaker as I had hoped. Too limited for me."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Great speaker, but lacking","I love the Apple HomePod, great integration with Apple Music, but my main issue with the speaker is not being able to put a song or music as an alarm. You would think that spending so much on a speaker and having access to millions of songs wouldn’t have that issue, but hopefully Apple fixes that with the next update. That is one thing that I loved about Alexa, music to wake me up, not an abrupt alarm noise."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,A Great Compact speaker with smarts!,"Don’t let its size fool you, the sound quality is best in class. Keep in mind it’s not meant to be replacing full sounds systems, yet! It’s Apples first step in providing a home smart speaker system. With the next iOS update and Airplay 2 this will really begin to be amazing. Yes it was designed for Apple Music subscribers and there’s a reason it’s growing faster than Spotify domestically in the US! The iOS interface and ecosystem with Siri will set this smart speaker above the rest. It’s worth the cost as the future Home Pod updates will make this a compelling product for any Apple fan or iPhone/iPad owner!"
3.0,a month ago,Best Buy,"The music is great, assistant stinks!",We’re all apple so our five homepods provide for great sound throughout our house. With iTunes as our music source we can enjoy any type of music all day long. We just wish apple would give Siri a better education so she could provide us with more answers to our questions.
5.0,a year ago,bestbuy.ca,unreal sound quality,"I own a Bose bluetooth speaker, a E Boom and other various bluetooth speakers over the years. This speak sound quality is outstanding! coupled with Apple Music subscription this is the perfect kitchen or living room device to play any of millions of songs. I am rarely awed by new tech as it tends to be incremental in development. This speaker is a major step up in sound quality and ease of use... that said, it costs a lot!"
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,"Amazing sound, great design, easy to use","I’ve been waiting for the HomePod since it was announced. The sound is as good as everyone describes. While it doesn’t match a standalone quality amplifier with good speakers, it’s easily the best smart speaker. I have a Harmin/Karden Onyx and the HomePod sounds considerably better in both bass and high range. I’d say the mid range is about the same. Siri is pretty good as well. Right now it’s limited to a few things outside controlling the speaker. One small issue I had was it frequently played the live or the video version of the song."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Better than the critics say,"A lot of critics have said negative things about the HomePod as a personal assistant, but if you have an iPhone and are looking for a good home speaker, this thing is awesome. It fills the room with amazing sound, and has access to the 50 million songs in Apple Music. We are very pleased with our purchase! It easily syncs with the 4 iPhones in our family. We have it in the kitchen and love it."
5.0,2 years ago,very.co.uk,"Looks great, soinds even better","Never would I write a review after a day, but I have to make an exception and admit I'm very impressed with the looks but more importantly the sound quality of the Homepod. I have a Naim Mu-So and B&W Zeppelin wireless amongst other high quality audio equipment so I wasn't expecting a level of sound detail to almost equal proportions of the afore mentioned from such a small unit. And to top it all of SIRI is so far 100% accurate even with my Suffolk accent. If you have Apple equipment I'd definitely say it's worth a punt, if you don't then don't bother as it's not built for anything other than Apple. Finally to confirm the Homepod does work without an Apple Music subscription it just makes life easier for SIRI to function."
5.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Excellent product!,"I love my HomePod! I waited till I could afford one as I didn’t want a cheaper ‘Alexa’ product as I’m so used to saying ‘Siri’. It’s very responsive and can hear me and answer even when loud music is playing. The sound quality is excellent and the HomePod looks neat and attractive in every room. It works well with my smart lighting, again, very responsive. I’m now saving up for the next one!"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Sound gets A+,"Sound is awesome A+. I am using this primarily as a kitchen speaker to fill the room. I tried a pair of pre-amped bookshelf speakers and a small sound bar but neither did the job. I did a lot of research before trying the HomePod. This thing sounds fantastic. I want another for stereo sound. Only one flaw, Siri is useless. The voice activation is awful..."
4.0,a month ago,Currys,Glenys's review of Apple HomePod,"Pros: Sound is great, good looking, small and neat. Doesn’t stand out. Cons: Can’t at the moment connect with our music through Siri. Have been talking to Apple support but they say we are not the only ones and they have referred it back to Apple."
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Great sound with an extremely easy set up process,The HomePod is a great sounding semi-smart speaker. Everyone knows that Siri is good but not great. Music sounds amazing but be warned it only works with AppleMusic. If you don’t have it or haven’t used it there is a free trial and in my view it’s an amazing service.
5.0,a year ago,Argos,"Great looking, sounding unit","Perfect connection to Apple music through Siri with over 50 million tracks. Bought this to add to another Homepod to pair them in stereo mode which is amazing. All round sound, crisp base, detailed treble and clear mid range. Easy to connect, just plug it in , pair your ios device and away you go. Best active speaker out there...."
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,"If you love apple, get one!",I’ve had my HomePod for over a year and I’ve had no issues whatsoever. Responsive to even the most quiet voice command. Amazing sound. My friends always comment on how loud and clear it sounds for its size! Thinking about getting another one honestly!
4.0,a week ago,John Lewis,Loving it,Very good speaker. Love asking for music and information BUT you do have to join Apple Music for a monthly fee and have a Smart phone. Setting up was easy when we used a You tube video. We are in our 70’s - if that helps! We have the black one as we use it in our kitchen dining area.
4.0,a year ago,Currys,Stephen's review of Apple HomePod,"Pros: First and foremost it’s a speaker and it’s a great one at that, with its processing chip from the iPhone it readjust the bass and sound to its surroundings so it’s clever like that. Asking it simple things like turn on the Phillips hue lights is a breeze once set up. Cons: It works with Spotify on a basic level which is still good but it certainly needs an update in the future to make it work with voice commands like the Apple Music, price is steep but inline with other big home speakers.Siri needs a big update to make it inline with amazon and google assistants."
5.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Great sound and hub,I was holding out for good reviews and decided to pull the trigger. Easy setup and use as a hub through the home app. Perfect for a home automation hub if you have an iPhone. The sound quality is a selling point in its own. You can whisper “hey Siri” under the music and it will hear you...magic
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Awesome speaker,"I have owned this for about 6 months now and I am still in love with it. It does so much more then I use it for, but I mainly bought it for my music. The speakers are really excellent and the sound is superb. The bass is not overwhelming, but perfect in my opinion. I know the sound of music is subjective. Really happy with this and I have zero buyers remorse. You won’t be sorry."
5.0,5 months ago,Overstock.com,Great speaker. At first I didnt expect that the sound would be this good. Like it so much and both another one for a more soround sound. The homepods are in the living room and we listen the music from outside and the volume is not even at maximum. Apple gadges are the best.,Great speaker. At first I didnt expect that the sound would be this good. Like it so much and both another one for a more soround sound. The homepods are in the living room and we listen the music from outside and the volume is not even at maximum. Apple gadges are the best.
3.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Not worth the price,"Great, and I do mean GREAT sound quality. Easy connectivity to iPhone (haven’t tried with any others though). The HomePod doesn’t do much because it doesn’t connect to the internet and you have to ask Siri (who doesn’t understand well) to do everything because there are no buttons besides up and down volume. Thanks to B&H for the sale because we all know Apple NEVER has a sale. If you are just looking for sound quality it’s great otherwise get Alexa or Google Home."
4.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Awesome Speaker for Apple Ecosystem Users,"If you use iOS, tvOS, Apple Music and HomeKit, adding a HomePod is a great way to tie it all together. Airplay 2 is still a great system even for Spotify users, it as of now, don’t expect Siri to help you with non-Apple services. It has a very full sound, and an easy setup."
5.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Great speaker!,"I’ve been eyeing up a HomePod for a while and decided to take the plunge. The sound is fantastic quality and Siri can hear you from across the room when you speak at a normal tone, even with loud music playing! As with all Apple products, with the more features they keep adding with new iOS updates, the more smart this speaker will become. If you’re after speaker quality rather than a full smart speaker, this is for you."
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Homepod,"The Homepod was really easy to set up, just pointed my phone at it and we was away. The quality of sound is excellent. You need to teach Siri the music you like and the music you do not. Yes you can just ask her to play your playlists etc, but when you ask her to play a certain artist you will get some songs you do not like. If you tell her when certain songs play that you do not like this song, she takes the information on board. Fab piece of kit!"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Sound - Mic Works well with HomeKit,"First off, even though it is a little pricier than the competition out there the sound is amazing. Who would have thought that such a small compact unit could deliver that sort of bass. Siri works well for simple tasks, and works amazingly well with HomeKit to set lighting scenes or adjust the thermostat. The mics are sensitive and hear me from a few rooms over or even while the music is playing at a high volume."
3.0,2 years ago,very.co.uk,Ok for just Apple Music via AirPlay,"Very weighty and looks physically appealing. Whilst the sound quality is amazing, it is very over priced for the quality of product. Only works efficently for Apple Music. Will not play anything else such as soundcloud or YouTube well unlike Sonos (Not even a sonos fan!) which play all well. Even when playing videos it created audio delay and phone freezing. They have a bit of work to do with this one."
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great... except,"The only two negative things I can say is that the mid-range is lacking and siri could be way more capable. Other than that the speaker is amazing. I wish it had shipped with stereo pairing, but maybe they will get that soon. I did not have a problem activating siri when the music was at 100% but I did have a problem if I didn't wait for the volume to drop before I started giving instructions. That being said the music does not distort any at 100% and the base doesn't just thump, you can distinguish the tones in the base. I look forward to hearing it paired with the second one that I bought and seeing if that improves the mid-range any at all. If you are already deep in apple's eco system then you will definitely love this speaker."
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Happy with purchase!,"I was a little skeptical at first, but glad I made the decision to go ahead and purchase. It was a great addition to the apple products I already have. Nice amount of bass and sound for a small area. Will possible purchase another for another area in my home."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Excellent speaker, great for Smart Home","The quality of this speaker is great given its size. Being able to use Siri for voice controlled music and other things is fun. Integration with Apple TV needs to be improved upon, however. We use this as the central hub for our Smart Home and love it. Siri has improved over the years so we find ourselves cursing much less because of that."
5.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Exceptional,"Somewhat hesitantly purchased this yesterday. Have to say that even at this early stage, there are no regrets whatsoever. The sound quality is exceptional and would easily give my Denon system a run for its money. In fact, it could well be better - very difficult to draw comparisons at the moment. But, one thing is for sure, the item is an excellent addition to our range of apple products and will be enjoyed. Would recommend."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Apple hit a triple,I will start by saying that I have the Sonos playbar with 3 other Sonos speakers and this Apple HomePod sounds better! Not to take anything away from Sonos but Apple hit a triple and not a Homerun only because it doesn’t give you all the functions that the Amazon Echo give you. Best sound speaker by far and as long as you setup Apple Music you’ll love it! Pandora works great too but I’m hoping Apple offers updates in the future to add a few more features.
1.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Terrible product,I thought that this would be like a beats pill but it is the opposite of that . I gave the product one star because of the connectivity issues . The HomePod can only be used if you have Internet access a router and an Apple product . In other words if you were to take this camping with you ;unless you have a physical router turned on and Internet you cannot use this. And you cannot use it with imac unless you have an iPod or iPad or iphone to go with it .
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Excellent speaker,"I wanted a good-sounding speaker to replace the Jambox in my kitchen, and this does a great job. The smart speaker features are fine, but they are not my focus and I don't do a lot of smart home appliances. This is a great speaker, and easily integrates with the Apple ecosystem, both in terms of Apple Music and easy streaming of music/podcasts from your phone or other device."
2.0,a month ago,John Lewis,BEWARE! Cannot play BBC Radio,"I was so looking forward to replacing my old DAB kitchen radio with the HomePod but sad to discover that it cannot play BBC radio stations without streaming via an iPhone on the BBC app. I think this is the BBC’s fault, but if, like me, you were hoping to play BBC radio stations, this probably isn’t for you."
2.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Echo is Better At Half The Price,Sound is fine but not noticeably better than Amazon’s Echo. The big negative is that you can’t just play radio stations or Pandora or Spotify by speaking to it like you can with Echo. You have to play them on your phone and then switch them over to Home Pod with Air Play. This seems to be because they want you to subscribe to Apple’s music service which is the only one you can call up by voice. Apple should remedy this with a software update.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Airplay 2 alone is a great feature.,"Great build and sound quality. I have an echo device and a google home and Airplay 2 alone makes the HomePod a no brainer. It’s super convenient and a lot better than controlling music playback with just your voice. Also, I think HomeKit it’s a nicer smarthome platform for the same reason. The home app it’s really nice when you don’t want to use your voice to control smarthome devices."
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Primarily for high-quality sound,"I bought this primarily for the sound quality, and was not disappointed. When paired in stereo the sound quality is better than 2x. If you don’t believe me, try listening to a good music track with one earbud, then with two. I know it’s not a true direct comparison, but the improvement in sound is similar. I also trust this much more (privacy-wise) than a Google or Amazon product."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Amazing, and also great open box","I had purchased the apple HomePod a little over a week ago, and I can tell you first hand that it is truly the best speaker! Bass is perfect, but only at higher volumes. But the ""Hey, Sir"" feature with it is responsive and quick with answer. I cannot wait till they roll out more updates with this product to make it 10x better! Premium product for a premium price. You actually get what you pay for!"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Excellent sound and smarts from a small footprint,The HomePod generates such excellent sound. You would think that it’s coming from a much larger device. The microphones work perfectly to hear Siri commands and it’s so intuitive to use. The automatic adjustment of sound based on room placement is a great feature as well. Buy this over any Amazon or Google trash.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Absolutely Great Sound from a Compact Package,"I know the knock on the HomePod is the lack of smarts. I agree, however I purchased this for my love of music. No other smart speaker is as ""smart"" when it comes to sound as the HomePod. I am in the Apple Eco-system so this works perfectly. It is my second HomePod and I am looking forward to stereo sound coming from Apple soon! In terms of Siri, I know apple will begin updating the software that drive it...so it should get better with time."
4.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,"Great speaker, good assistant.","This speaker for the most part does everything I need it to do. I use Siri for smart home stuff, timers and that’s it for the most part. I having one sounds great but I just keep thinking about how great it would be with another. And one is already expensive. I also wish there were a way to use it with my TV without an Apple TV. Overall I do recommend one if you are in the apple ecosystem"
5.0,10 months ago,Target,"This speaker is incredible! I have never had bass come from a speak this size. The packaging is minimal so make sure you set up properly. We did not set up correctly and thought she did not do much except project sound for our music. Now that she is set up, she does everything! LOVE IT!","This speaker is incredible!

2.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Good bass for a speaker its size,"Aesthetically pleasing, good bass, and can fill the room up with sound. However, that really seems to be the extent of this ""smart speaker"". It can set timers and alarms, in itself, it does not connect to any other Apple devices. My partner and I own a great bit of Apple devices from Desktops, phones, tablets, laptops, and the AirPods, this speaker works with non of the above. Volume control and an app to organize your day on the speaker would be great. I do not recommend this item unless you don't have any other speaker... there should at least be a Bluetooth feature."
5.0,10 months ago,Argos,Amazing,"You really must be an apple fan to get the best from this as this works so well with their infrastructure........I am just now getting my head around linking it to some of the Philips hue range. This runs apple airplay and is not a Bluetooth speaker so be aware as this is not a cheap piece of kit but if it fits your parameters then I get one, you won’t be disappointed"
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Gotta love it,"I have several of these as they tend to become habit forming after owning just one. The sound it excellent, the style it minimalistic and excellent and the functions are ever improving. Those great things being noted, Siri as a digital AI needs improvement as she tends to blunder more often than she ought."
2.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Siri is not very smart,"I am part of the Apple eco system and this speaker sounds awesome. But I don’t want just a speaker, I want a smart speaker and Siri is dumb compared to Alexa. Improve Siri and HomeKit and this speaker will be awesome, but till than I am using Alexa!"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Superb sound and simple to set up.,Sound quality is the outstanding attribute of this speaker. Audio is balanced throughout wave spectrum with substantial base. Set up is simple and quick. Integration with other apple products is seamless. A subscription to Apple Music is needed to fully realize a wide array of music genres. Siri responds readily to normally spoken verbal commands.
5.0,a year ago,samsclub.com,Has Great sound.,"I bought this about a week ago. Mostly interested in the quality of the sound as reviewed by others. I'm not disappointed. Sounds great. East to move around to other rooms and it automatically adjusts sound for that room. I'm not too much into the home automation, but maybe one day I will and this would be able to do that. I know I can always count on Apple to make a great product and keep improving it over time."
4.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Great Hub and speaker,"Since I purchased the HomePod I loved it. Only thing is, I wish I could use both my iPhone and my wife’s iPhone as primary accounts. It’s easy to setup, use, and it looks great, although I must say it’s on the expensive side. Overall I like it, I’m looking to find another for a cheaper price."
5.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,HomePod is the best sounding smart home speaker!,"Simply put: this is the best sounding smart home speaker on the market! Is it more expensive? Yes. Could it do more ""smart"" things? Yes. Do I care? No. It is the best on the market!"
5.0,a year ago,Target,Weight denotes sound quality,"Just as many other reviewers have stated, the sound quality is phenomenal! Surprisingly heavy for such a small speaker, but the weight obviously equates to amazing sound. Siri has limited capability, but I'm sure things will be added over time to her repertoire. Otherwise, Siri is quick to answer and does a fantastic job coordinating with Apple Music."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Not bad for just being released.,"Not a bad smart home item. I bought it when it was first released roughly. Found out to do anything on it including set up you need to have WiFi. I was mainly looking to use it as a portable speaker around the house. If i would have had WiFi when we moved and i bought it, it probably would have been nicer. Functions of it are still good but could use a couple tweaks for the next model."
5.0,2 years ago,John Lewis,A little speaker with alot of music punch,"This is my fist streaming speaker after my stereo finally died after 15 years. The speaker is smaller and heavier than I expected. It took less that 30 seconds set up with my iPhone and was ready to go instantly. The sound it produces is excellent and fills the room, with no distortion at all. I was looking for a music speaker first and smart device second, so most of the issues with Siri is my ability not to remember names track names and tracks correctly to play from subscription to my iTunes Match collection, rather than Apple Music. I am big fan of simplicity and the setup and look have ticked all my boxes and needs."
5.0,a year ago,Target,Niiice!,"Love it! In fact, I’m listening to mine right now as I write this review while doing my workout on my stationary trainer. “Hey Siri, turn the volume to 69 percent.” Boom goes the dynamite! All three carefully placed HomePods respond accordingly in sync with wondrous sound. The only difference with my newest HomePod purchased from Target is the $100 price cut... niiiiice!"
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Blown Away,"I was not expecting this to be as incredible as it is. It’s the best Smart Speaker out there! The HomePod is incredibly loud and you can feel base. I was planning on getting a soundbar but connected to my Apple TV, it works as a surround sound speaker. Good purchase!"
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great price for best quality,"The HomePod is one of the very few items I have actually fallen in love with, after my 4K OLED TV. It has incredible sound, bass, clarity for indoor and outdoor use (only when in use; not weather-proof). I waited no time to show it off to my family and all of the incredible Siri features for hand-off use and immediate commands. It has so far handled everything I have put it up against. I would buy another and use as Stereo."
5.0,a year ago,very.co.uk,AMAZING SPEAKER!,"The sound quality is breathtaking. At first I thought I was mad at spending that much on a speaker, but once it arrived, my god, I was blown away! For such a small speaker it packs a massive punch with brilliant bass and clear vocals, this smart speaker has it all. Siri can be useful too for selecting music and setting timers. Overall, it’s the best purchase I’ve made in the last few years!"
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great speaker,"First of all, I was surprised at how small the Homepod is. I was worried that it would take up too much space on a counter or shelf. It is a perfect size. That said, the sound quality is fantastic and crystal clear. I don't have any smart home products, so I use my Homepod primarily to play music. It works great with Apple Music, allowing you access to all types of music."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Great sound,"Purchased two HomePods , easy setup and fantastic sound. Siri is not as intuitive as Alexa but it really not a deal breaker. My wife like to use it at night with ambient sounds as she goes to sleep. Easy to setup morning wake up times ,"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,"This is my third homepod, very happy","I’m very happy with this purchase. I have two white HomePods and this is my first black one. The sound quality on these are great, I use these for music listening and for triggering my smart home. No complaints about the HomePod."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Awesome Sound Quality,"Can't say enough about the quality of this. I know some criticize that Alexa is better virtual assistant to Siri, but the sound quality when used in the ""pair"" mode with two HomePods is simply unbeatable. Got these on a great Christmastime sale!"
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,I'm hoping to get a second!,"The sound the HomePod creates is AMAZING. Hence, why I'd love to get a second one and see the magic that creates. It definitely matters where you place the HomePod and you need to make sure it's not surrounded by a bunch of stuff. I'm an Apple Fan, a Siri Fan and I'm building my little Smart House; so it's a great addition for me."
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,I do not regret!,"I use this HomePod all the time! I use it to get up in the morning with the alarm clock, even though it can be annoying, telling time, knowing the weather, sunset and sunrise, making jokes, texting and answering calls, and everything else! I have 0 regrets with this purchase. I also think the base in incredible!"
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Love my Home Pod,"So, they had a pretty deep discount in the store (100.00 off) so I decided to go for it....I have an Alex device the 100.00 one. It doesn't work that great however, the Home Pod is unbelievable, sound quality, response to my voice, working 110% of the time. I know it is a bit overpriced, there are some reasons not to buy it. but I am going to buy a second one."
1.0,a year ago,Argos,Really poor,"I bought two of these after reading reviews online. I was initially happy but connection was complicated and confusing. I wanted to pair with my Apple TV to play music/radio but this was near impossible. I could group the two together very briefly before they would go back to playing individually, but they would lose the pairing with the tv and my phone. I’ve gave one star as the sound was great...for one whole day!"
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Awesome sound and easy to use,"This is my second HomePod, as an Apple Music subscriber these speakers make it so easy to get music around the house and they sound better than any other speaker I’ve tried for the price. Controlling the music is easy via Siri on the speaker or from an iPhone or iPad. Would recommended these to everyone who uses any Apple device, great sound, easy to use and easy to set up."
5.0,2 years ago,Currys,Sinclair's review of Apple HomePod,"Pros: The sound is outstanding, let it play for a while until it figures out the room its in, then you are in for a treat. It will play any tunes in the iTunes library, any! You control it with your voice it even hears when you whisper. Siri is fast and responsive but it really a music speaker. Cons: It's not a bluetooth speaker or multi-room yet. It will only play what you have on iTunes or what's in the iTunes library very Apple centric. No USB ports or connectivity of any kind. Multi-room apparently comes out later this year via airplay 2."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Great sound, but limited experience","We really like the HomePod, it has great sound and works easily with Apple Music and Siri, as well as our HomeKit-enables devices. The only thing we wish is that it would recognize multiple accounts like the Google Home devices do. As it currently stands, it’s tied just to my AppleID, with no way to recognize my families music playlists, notes and reminders, or Contacts/phone calls. That’s why I had to remove a star."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great device,"I was originally hesitant to buy a HomePod, as I'm not a huge music buff. However, I listened to the quality of the device over and over again at Best Buys and at Apple stores, and was blown away each time. I purchased my first HomePod at CostCo, but then decided I couldn't say no when Best Buy reduced the price $100 on Black Friday. Great sound - small footprint - and in my opinion, worth the money."
3.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Just ok,I had to get a replacement speaker from the Apple store. I had this speaker for a month and it just stopped responding. I tried resetting it and it still wouldn’t respond. Took it to an Apple store for inspection and they ended up replacing it. It sounds great and Siri is awesome.
5.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Love my HomePod,I have 2 and have them set up in the home app so I can use them as my surround sound for my Apple TV! Never thought I would say that but I got rid of wires and other devices for a more clean look. I love HomePod and the sound is great! Not to mention it can control my ecobee thermostat and my August door lock.
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,This is my second HomePod.,"My second HomePod makes it nice to hear music throughout my house. I can switch between stereo or the mono from both HomePods. Seri is available throughout my house, as well. I just wish Seri was more useful! That’s why 4 stars and not five."
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Amazing sound replaced my dying onkyo avr,"I had purchased a Onkyo TX-NR 757 a couple of years ago and it was having some issues as have all the Onkyos I've had before it, so I though it was time to change and got two Apple HomPods and set them up as a stereo pair for my Apple TV, I do not miss the big avr and big speakers at all, the HomePods have replaced my old set up without any disappointments at all, I am amazed at the room/house filling sound, the base is just as good as my old subwoofer, nice clear dialog and stereo separation with hits of surround sound, not native surround sound but close. 100% recommend, even if it’s just one it’s still amazing (I tested watching tv with one versus two)"
4.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,"Great speaker, has potential",I have been building my smart home for a few years now and the HomePod is such a nice a nice companion. Being able to tell it to run lights on and off is great! There is a little more potential for other features but overall it’s something great to have.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Excellent sound quality,"No matter where you stand you always get the full potential of this speaker, it's not a problem for me since I bought this for my girlfriend who has an iPhone, but you must have an iPhone, iPad or Macbook in order for this to be used. All in all its worth the money I spent on it, I got it 100 bucks off on Black Friday but its definitely worth the full price"
5.0,a year ago,Argos,"Perfect for me, but maybe not for everyone","When Apple announced the HomePod I was excited - I didn’t yet have a music player at home, and am quite embedded in the Apple ecosystem. I’m probably a niche user as an iTunes Match subscriber I enjoy all the benefits of Siri without needing the more expensive Apple Music service (much of the music I like isn’t in there anyway). The sound quality is great, easy to set up and simple to use. I’ve been really impressed. I do think it’s expensive but I’d offset the price with some vouchers."
5.0,a year ago,Target,"Fantastic sound and quality. I have always been a Bose fan and never really liked the Beats collection. I am very pleased with the quality of HomePod as it has the depth, base and sound quality of the top speakers in the market. Siri is amazing and very user friendly.

For the price, I’m amazed that it’s so limited. I would recommend spending a little more on a B&O M5 or the cheaper M3. It does Airplay and Chromecast.

5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Great speaker!!!,"I love the Apple HomePod! I chose this speaker over any of the other because 1) I was going to use this for music and I knew this had the best sound 2) I got it just so I could turn my lights on and off, I didn’t need Siri to do anything crazy just control my hue lights and tell me the weather. Overall for what I wanted and expected it’s perfect"
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Good Sound,"Good sound. Fairly easy to set up, but has been difficult to say the least to navigate between my HomePod and Apple TV using my Home App on my IPhone.

5.0,3 weeks ago,Best Buy,Awsome sound and Siri!,"The homepods have awesome sound quality. I have 3 one in kitchen, bedroom and living room. You can play the same music on all 3, so there is music all throughout the house. Just say ”hey Siri, play music everywhere”."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,"Loved the first one, added a second.",I loved the sound of my new HomePod so I purchased a second so I could have stereo sound not mono.

5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,"Amazing sound, Siri still needs work","This is my second HomePod. Its amazing alone, but as a pair it sounds fantastic. Siri still has a long way to go to compete with Alexa or Google, but I bought this more for music than a smart speaker. I use both Apple Music and Spotify. Spotify is leagues better in my opinion, but its easy to use Spotify with Airplay 2 on the HomePod."
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Great Product!,"Amazing speaker, loud and clear. Fills any room and works seamlessly with any of my other Apple products, iPhone, iPad, apple tv, etc. Siri as the personal assistant needs some work compared to something like an Alexa, but every other feature blows Alexa out of the water."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,A pleasant surprise.,Excellent sound and build quality. Siri can hear me over loud music and from other rooms in my home. Works very well with Apple Music. The unit itself feels heavy and very solid. Sleek design.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great sounding speaker,I was a bit skeptical buying this product without first listening to it. But after setting it up I knew right away that it sounded great to my ears. I’m no audiophile but to me this sounded better than the Sonos one I was considering also. Especially then bass. Siri needs lots of improvement and I hope Apple addresses that with software updates. But the hardware and sound is top notch.
5.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Excellent Sound Quality,"I was very skeptical about purchasing the HomePod for a very long time no, so when I saw that it was at $100 off so I couldn’t resist it. Let me say that I have not regretted it one bit, sound is crystal clear. My only complaint is that, I wish there was a way to adjust the bass and treble as you can on the Sonos."
2.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Alexa (echo dot) paired with Bose soundlink,"Initial response (8hrs post purchase): although a big fan of everything Apple, but an honest initial opinion - My echo dot paired with Bose soundlink II is better. Connects to many more devices/light switches, plays music from prime/Pandora, etc, Alexa is more responsive, bose speaker is portable. I’m not yet impressed with HomePod (although it plays my Apple Music library). The first time “Wow” maybe for folks who didn’t use Alexa hooked to quality speakers and didn’t really use smart home devices. Will try another week. Maybe I change my opinion."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Another awesome Apple product!,"I am impressed with the Home Pod for the most part. The sound quality is amazing and I can hear it from all rooms in my house. I am slowly transforming my home into a smart home and knew I needed this as a crucial piece. It works with Apple Home Kit and I can control my lights through it. (I use the Phillips Hue bulbs) It is pricy, but I am really impressed with the sound quality."
5.0,11 months ago,bhphotovideo.com,B&H delivers on many levels,"I ordered my HomePod based on previous experience with B&H. I had researched the product and where to buy it. B&H was great on price and delivery. And now that I have been using it - the sound quality, the material and the other benefits it offers live up to Apples reputation. I couldnt be more delighted"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Good sound but could be better,"So I was excited to get this speaker. I didn’t care about Alexa or Google Assistant being better because all I wanted was the best sound, and Apple promised that. The sound is good, the bass is deep and mellow, but I think the speaker misses clarity for the vocals. The bass is deep and room filling I just wish the rest was a little more balanced."
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Great sound for small form factor,I purchased the Homepod to replace my Denon receiver and bookshelf speakers. The sound quality and compact size of the Homepod is amazing. It's sound better than my old equipment and takes up a fraction of the space.
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Best sound in a compact size,"This little giant has bass as well as crystal clear mods and highs. Set it anywhere in a room and the onboard processor adjusts automatically, genius! Love this little powerhouse. Siri: play me some music... (-:"
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Apple's Quality Speaker Interfaces w/Apple Devices,"Apple's high quality speaker interfaces nicely with other Apple products in the network environment with ease and great results. Can use with iPhone, Apple TV, and MacBook to stream sound to it, along with alarms, weather forecasts, etc."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Impressive,"This thing has really got some great sound quality and actually adjusts sound based on the room it's in. Just as any other Apple product, it's super easy to connect to and Apple Music makes for a great user experience. I love that I can connect and kick my girlfriend off!"
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,When it works it’s great,On my second one now. First one would randomly freeze and start screaming at me in a loud buzz. This one seems to be fine. Love the sound quality it provides. Listens too well sometimes and freaks the wife out in the middle of the night
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Powerful,Very loud and powerful. Any song at the tip of your tongue. Love that you can change the volume or have Siri play similar songs to the songs you like. Allows you also to just pick an artist and hear multiple songs by them or a specific album.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Even better than expected!,"While this was purchased as a Christmas gift for a family member, we did get to compare it to other smart speakers. Siri might not be the most powerful smart assistant - but the HomePod blows away the sound quality of Alexa, Bose and Sonos speakers we own."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Very Solid Speaker w/ well known limitations,"Upon receiving my Homepod, I was very impressed with the sound quality. It rivals, if not all out beats anything at this price point. The microphones are also incredible at picking up your requests, far better than the Amazon Echo that I replaced. As an Apple Music subscriber, I am happy, but buys should be aware of the limitations of Siri compared to Google or Amazon."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Fantastic speaker and smart device,"The HomePod may not be for everyone but it is the best combination of speaker and smart device. It sounds fantastic, the microphones pick up commands easily (sometimes too easily when it mistakes other words for ""Hey Siri""), and Hey Siri works reasonably well. Siri may not be the best assistant out there but your privacy will be better protected than with the alternatives at least."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,"Sound quality 1st, smart features 2nd!",Best sounding Bluetooth speaker I’ve ever had and I’ve had quite a few. Yes the smart features are behind and lacking currently but with the processor this speaker has I’m absolutely sure Apple will have updates in the smart speaker features in due time if you’re into that. Works great with HomeKit and build quality is of course superb. If Apple wanted to compete with the other smart speakers I’m sure they would have had a lot more gimmicky features at launch however this is first a superior sounding bluetooth speaker first that happens to have smart features with Siri. Apple with have software updates later giving more smart features. Well done in my opinion!
5.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Amazing sound from an incredible speaker.,I bought one HomePod a few months after it was released and was really impressed with the sound it made. Since then Apple updated its software to enable 2 homepods to be used in stereo. I bought the second speaker mainly because I wanted to see how 2 sounded and I can honestly say they are incredible. The price is high but the sound quality is unbelievable.
5.0,a year ago,John Lewis,You won’t be disappointed,"Great sound quality, regardless of where you place it. Very easy to set up if you are already a member of the “Apple family” (let your iPhone do all the work for you). With that in mind remember it is an Apple product and is therefore designed to work exclusively with other apple products. Siri is still evolving and I’m sure that with future iOS updates will be able to perform more tasks than at present."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,199 are you out of your mind!,"This is my fourth Apple HomePod. I would not have bought more than one, if they weren’t great. With the holiday sale, or price cut making the HomePod $199, it’s a 5 star value! And, SO easy to set up. Works with Apple Music (of course), Spotify, podcasts, etc... Love it!"
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,HomePod a homerun,"The packaging and unboxing of the HomePod was really impressive, to begin with. Setup was a breeze with Apple device. The sound is incredible. Wholly recommend Apple Music subscription. Siri picks up commands perfectly from across the room, as well as different levels. Impressed all around. Thank you Apple & B&H!!!"
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Great Sound,"Like most reviewers have already pointed out the HomePod was built for music and less as a smart speaker. Enjoy listening to music. Speakers have a lot of base, restricts the place it can be used. If it was portable I would rate it 5/5."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Stereo pair sounds fantastic!,"I bought a single HomePod first. The sound quality was okay, sounded one dimensional. Then I bought a second to test the sound quality of a stereo pair. The sound quality of a stereo pair was fantastic!"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Sound,"Got two of these and although it took a while, they now act in stereo when I play music from my phone. The sound is the best of any ""Portable"" speaker system I have tested and the stereo fills a very large room and deck around my pool. Excellent. Siri can be quirky but is also helpful for minor tasks allowing me to change volume with my voice and set alarms for grilling and just about anything else with ease."
5.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Sound Quality!,"Wow, I'm very impressed with the sound quality. At low volumes it produces a nice full sound, and can also be pumped up and fill a whole room. I tested a whole bunch of smart/bluetooth speakers and the HomePod was by far the best sounding unit for the price."
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Looks great and Sounds Great.,This is a great sounding speaker and the mics work well to pick up voice requests throughout the apartment. Adding users and being able to set reminders through the home pod is a great feature. Also there are many features for smart home options that we did not try out
5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,"Great deal, great sound",The price was exceptional but I was a bit concerned that the product would have some defects. Im happy to report that it works well and was very easy to set up. The packaging however was not as I would expect since it came in a box with just the minimum amount of bubble wrap around the product. Im surprised that it was not damaged during shipment. All works well and I would consider ordering another.
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great for Apple customers,"Great speaker quality for the size, clean treble and surprisingly more bass than expected. Point to note: HomePod does not have Bluetooth capability to pair with android phones or windows laptop. Siri currently only support Apple Music, so if you’re a Spotify user, you’re out of luck. Designed for customer that is deep in the Apple Ecosystem."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Beautiful Sound,"I have a 5.1 Sonos home theatre system that I was using to play music when not watching TV and the HomePod rivals the system. The bass is there as is the treble. It does sound better at louder volumes, but at lower volumes Sonos has it beat. It’s better than a Sonos Play 1 and as good as a Sonos Play 5. If you’re concerned about Alexa’s lack of privacy and that it’s always listening, then go with Siri on the HomePod."
5.0,a year ago,focuscamera.com,HomePod is great if you are an Apple person!,"The homepod arrived quickly and without any issues. As for the product itself, itâ€™s a little more expensive than Google and Alexa, but the sound quality is also better. Siri canâ€™t hold a candle to Google Assistant or Alexa I hear, but if you have Apple Music and control your home with Homekit then HomePod will work super well for you. I also believe it will get better as Apple develops Siri - which happens in the back-end."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Amazing Sound Quality,"Really amazing sound quality. The bass is very strong. The functionality is still behind Amazon as a smart speaker, but the mics are very good at picking up you saying ""Hey Siri"" when the speaker is at any volume. My Sonos and Amazon branded devices are nowhere near as good at that. Have had it now for 6 months or so and it's been great."
2.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Nope.,"I own most of the products that Apple makes and I love them. The Homepod just misses the mark. It does sound very good. I would say it’s equal to a Sonos 1 which I also own. But that’s where it ends. Siri does very little. It can’t check or add calendar items. It can’t recognize a song playing(think shamzam). It can’t answer a call, you can switch a call to it from your phone but callers told me I sounded far away(I was 6 inches from it). It is really build well, so that’s good. One other thing. I have the black one, and the shiney circle on top attracts dust like crazy. You can wipe it off and 10 minutes later it’s all cloudy looking and dusty. I’m guessing the magnet makes this happen. It really takes away from the look of it."
5.0,a year ago,Target,Bose quality sound,"Like many of the people posting reviews here, I also purchase Alexa products primerly for listening to music and was disppoiinted on the sound. The sound is clear but just not loud enough but HomePod did not dissapoint! WOW this thing is loud but not only loud but it has that deep base that you need too. I'm can't wait to get another one to pair and have music everywere I go in my appartment."
2.0,a year ago,Best Buy,not best sound speaker/smart speaker,"there was so much hype about the sound engineer involved into making this speaker, yes it sound decent but not that good. I have Bose sound link mini thats over 3 years old and cost me less (around 150) it sounded better than this apple homoepod. the only thing I liked about this speaker is the material quality and that's it. it is not as smart as you would think, siri is useless, at least to me."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Beautiful upgrade from Google Home,I love the sound of bass and crisp music. I can hear it all with this devices. The best part is that is was a lot bigger than I originally thought it would be. plays music right of your iPhone and will go through all your playlists. Still learning about it and all its functions. Can't wait to see the Apple upgrades making this little guy much more powerful and informative with the media.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great sound,I paired two together to get stereo sound in a large room. The sound is great. It fills the entire room. Siri is responsive and their are a lot of options to limit access controls if others in the house will use. It is only an option if you have apple content in iTunes or if you use Apple Music. There are not options to play other content.
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Fantastic sound for a “smart speaker”,"Fantastic sound for a wireless speaker, airplay works well and there is no video sound lag so I can use them when I watch YouTube or Netflix. Check before you buy, other systems can’t sync the sound and video properly. Buy these if your primary concern is sound quality. Buy something else if you meanly want a speaker to talk to."
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Small But Powerfull,"I use my HomePod with Apple Music. Siri is good but not perfect, not as good as iPhone. Sound quality is very good with exceptional bass. Set up with iPhone is very fast. HomePod can be controlled from iPhone or Apple Watch. This item with Apple Music is a good match and it is possible I will never buy a CD again. All in all I could not be happier."
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Incredible sound and voice recognition!,"I love this speaker. It sounds amazing wherever it is in the room, and can easily hear commands when it is blasting music—I hate having to yell over the sound for my device to hear me. I am really excited to see what new features it has with the IOS 13 software update in the fall!"
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,love it!,"The sound impresses me so much, so good for such a small speaker. Pair it with apple music and it's a match made in heaven. No sure why I waited this long to get it. Best Buy had it on sale for $249 finally made me pull the trigger. Love it so much that I bought a 2nd one a few days after."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Very Nice Piece of Tech,"I just purchased my HomePod today on Black Friday after looking into it for quite some time. Me being in the Apple ecosystem and watching many reviews on different smart speakers such as Alexa and SONOS, this Apple HomePod really is a very useful piece of technology to control other smart Home accessories like lights and locks and sounds amazing for the size. In my opinion this piece is well worth the money."
5.0,a year ago,very.co.uk,A concert in your home,I was very sceptical about paying this price for a speaker but OMG. The sound quality and bass are second to none. Siri commands seem to be vastly superior and it still understands you when music is blasting out. It’s far superior to anything I could have hoped for and it’s a must have for every room in the home now. Delivery was also quicker than advertised so that was a nice surprise
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Freaking awesome,Great sound and functionality. Siri does a goos job with understanding all the people in the house. She even knows which one we are. I can tell her to play “my” playlist and she know who I am. Music plays great on this device.
4.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,"Great sound, but Siri leaves a bit to desire",I love the sound quality of this speaker and the how good the microphone is even with loud music playing. There is a limited version of Siri with this HomePod. I wish that Siri was able to do as much on this product as it does with iOS devices.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Best smart soundsystem on the market,This is the first wireless speaker to deliver digital audio that sounded as good or better than vinyl. I love that I can pair it my HomePod to smart home devices but the real draw is the audio quality. My studio speakers don’t deliver audio this well! I plan on buying a second HomePod for my home office. Highly recommended for audiophiles.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Bought on sale. Great speaker sound.,This is a good smart speaker. Siri understands and the sound quality is very good. I bought this on sale which made the price reasonable. My son quickly set it up with the connectivity to my iPhone.
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,HomePod,"The sound quality is unlike any other home speaker I have heard thus far. Siri quickly responds to every request, or question. I’ve enjoyed it thus far, and will buy another. If you plan to buy, Best Buy price matches so make sure you check at your local BB before buying at other competitors."
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,All things everyone else said are true,The HomePod has been beat to death by reviewers saying it sounds great but it’s expensive and Siri is lacking. I bought this on sale and it’s still too expensive. I put it in my office and it works great but I’d have a hard time justifying buying another one. We’ll see what version 2 has to offer :)
5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Best Way to Purchase a HP,"Excellent product! This is our 4th HP and this one was just as new looking and set up immediately on the iPhone. There are stories of Open Box HP's having been set up by previous owners and having to be reset to factory settings before being set up by the new owner. The packaging was obviously not new, but the HP itself was pristine and set up just like the brand new one from the Apple Store. And....we saved nearly $75."
5.0,a month ago,Currys,Colin's review of Apple HomePod,Pros: Design is fantastic. Overall very compact and extremely simple to use. Quality is outstanding but only what you would normally expect from Apple. Sound is great. Cons: No bad points.
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Better than Alexa,"The microphone works super far away and the speakers provide a great quality of sound. If you have invested in Apple Music or have a great library of music or books on tape with Apple, this is a great buy. The only downside in my opinion is the conflict of “hey Siri” with your phone. Fortunately your phone doesn’t have near the distance on its mic that this product has."
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Excellent speaker,Use my HomePod in the living room and it can be heard through my house (about 700 sqft). Easily connects to my iPhone and works amazing. Siri is responsive across the house with timers and music. Connects with Apple Music subscription
4.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,"Cool to have, not something I needed.","This is a great product if you plan on only using it as a speaker. Siri is as useful as she can be. I use it to ask the simplest things. Spell this, text that. The sound quality is sooo good! I make phone calls on it the quality there is great too."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Sound,"This speaker puts out great sound and was super easy to set up because we have other apple products. The only issue we have is with it disconnecting from the Apple TV. Sometimes it does it on it's own but if we talk to Siri on the HomePod, we always have to reconnect to the Apple TV every time. Since we mainly use this as a speaker for our TV, that's pretty annoying. Overall, though, we really like it."
5.0,3 months ago,Other World Computing,Perfect,Was hesitant to buy with non-retail packaging but glad I pulled the trigger. Brand new perfect condition and set up was very easy after plugging in and resetting the homepod. Sounds fantastic. Think I’m going to get a second one to place at each end of my apartment.
4.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,"Great sound, helpfulness is getting there","Replaced an Amazon Echo with this. The sound is so much more richer and fuller. I love how well it fits into my Apple ecosystem. However, I do wish I could control more non-Apple devices with it. But I think that will come with time"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great but could be improved,I really like Apple products this one is good but probably my least favorite. It loses WiFi connection a lot and fails to work when you are selecting it as an audio source from your iPhone or iPad way too often. If they can make the connectivity better this would get 5 stars. I have noticed if I keep my phone right next to it it works better not sure why but it does.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Great sound, function, easy setup","If you are all in on all things Apple, then this is the smart speaker for you. While it may not have all of the function and “skills” of other smart speakers, this does exactly what I want. Siri is responsive and Apple Music curates some great playlists and radio stations, in addition to my own. This was a great purchase for me."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Amazing Sound,"Well. Apple has (again) exceeded our expectations!! It’s unbelievable how something so small can produce such an amazing, rich, sound. I love how I’m able to just tell Siri what to play, what to skip, raise or lower the volume and she packs a solid base sound. It sounds as if there’s more pieces playing when in actuality it’s just this one."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Excellent Buy,If anybody appreciates true quality sound then it is every penny’s worth. You will not be disappointed. There is no comparison with Amazon or Google. You get what you pay for. It is super heavy for a speaker but that shows why the speaker is expensive. It truly seems built like a tank. Enjoy the music. You will want to keep listening all day long.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,HomePod,"I mean it’s a HomePod. It’s genius. If you’re already here, go ahead and buy it. There is no smart speaker with better sound, better bass, or better voice recognition in my experience. My household is obsessed with it."
4.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,The best sound you would ever hear in a speaker,"Let’s me down with how locked down the system is on Apple but other than that it’s amazing. If you want a great speaker get this but if you want a basic speaker and a fully functional commands speaker get the Alexa echo that way you have both, that’s what I did"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Easy Siri,"Apple Honepod was so easy to setup I had music playing within minutes of unboxing. With or without Apple Music, you can share the HomePod with others on the same network. you can even password protect. I have only had it a few days, but I am loving it."
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Not as expected..,"For a long time i have wanted to purchase the homepod. After seeing the specs of it, 7 tweeters, and a 4inch sub, i thought it would sound amazing. The vocals and treble was not as high quality as my bang and olufsen beoplay s3. Then again the bass was amazingly deep. Siri can be pretty convenient. Sounds more like a $200 speaker than $349"
4.0,a year ago,Laptops Direct,Anselm's review of Apple HomePod,"Pros: For someone who’s infrastructure is Apple, HomePod is a natural fit. Cons: It is loud and fills a room. Guaging volume to something moderate is hard to achieve. For me I moved my speaker away from the wall (nearest to my neighbour’s room ) to my TV table. It did make a difference but it’s still loud but I’m not likely to upset my neighbour!"
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,I should have bought this sooner.,"If you are a Apple Music user the homepod is worth every penny. I am shocked at the quality of sound that comes from such a small speaker. Yes, Google Assistant is better than Siri but when it comes to playing music the homepod is where it is at."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,The bass on this speaker is deep and rich.,"I am really glad I waited for this speaker, and not quick to buy the others other there. It does not compare to other smart devices, because it isn’t branded as a smart device but as a true speaker for music. And it is amazing loud and even when at 10% volume everything is clear and crisp! Recommend playing thunderstorms on this speaker and going to sleep with it playing."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,HomePod is great for Apple users,"This is my 3rd HomePod and I love it. One for each room of the house. Best Buy’s sake was as the key. I can play music throughout the house and control all my smart home products, answer calls, create reminders, and so much more!"
1.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,"Apple copies again, calls it innovative...","Sure it works better with apple products than anything else, that's where the good news ends. First of all sound quality for a $350 is not great. Gets loud but bass is very bad. I think if you're going to sell an over priced speaker you should make it sound like a $350 speaker. Sound quality is obviously not what anyone cares about though anymore. They want things to make their lives better and to show off to their friends. It's like beats headphones overpriced garbage. What more do you want to know...."
5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Excellent sound quality from anywhere in the room,"Fantastic speaker, balanced sound no matter where in the room youre standing. Small size, disappears into the room. Gets LOUD. Siri service still needs to improve but as it does, this Speaker will automatically get better. That said, this thing is useless without an Apple Music subscription."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Open Box Item,Flawless and deeply discounted White Homepod for the steal. Everything was pristine minus the box being all taped & stickered up by BestBuy. Other than that I got 2 Homepod’s for under the price of 1 at retail from BestBuy & can now experience Stereo sound.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great if on sale and you use Apple Music,"Bought on sale during Black Friday, I would not pay full cost for the HomePod, and I would only buy if you are strongly into the Apple ecosystem and you use Apple Music. If you do not subscribe to Apple Music, do not buy the HomePod. Compared to Amazon's Echo, the sound of the HomePod is awesome! However, the echo is superior when it comes to voice commands."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great speaker! Siri will improve,I love this speaker! The sound and bass have been exceptional since I plugged it in. Integration with my iPhone was seamless and they interact very well. I have Apple Music so access to almost every song possible has been awesome. Limitations obviously are Siri and connecting other music platforms. Siri will improve as Apple learns and pushes updates to the speaker. Overall though happy with it and will eventually buy a second one.
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Smart! But could be smarter.,"Beautiful sound! Smart home connected. Could be a little smarter. Given the hardware, I expected a few other built in features. Perhaps with the next software upgrade from Apple.... ?"
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Fabtastic Speaker!,"This speaker honestly won’t replace your Alexa, Apple just hasn’t had the time to develop it that much yet. HOWEVER I will say the sound is second to NONE. I even route my Apple TV through the HomePod whenever I watch TV or movies because it sounds THAT good."
3.0,a year ago,very.co.uk,Great voice recognition but rather pricey,"Does a great job of hearing you whilst music is loud. Siri has mixed features currently but it’s great for music. Sound is good considering the size, pushes out good mid bass when on medium, get that wish for a little more. Ordered a second one to experience stereo, which was nice but not enough for the price so I returned the second one."
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Amazing sound for a little thing!,"Sound quality is incredible. Hard to believe so much bass can come out of something a little bigger than a small Kleenex box. The microphone is also ridiculously sensitive. I can ask it a question or give a command softly from the other side of my (small) townhouse, and itll answer without me having to repeat it. Crazy."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Excellent sound quality,Purchased this for my wife for an xmas gift. Sound quality is superb. She mostly streams radio and music from her MacBook and setup is extremely easy. fits in well with the apple ecosystem. This replaced a small Bose BT speaker and the sound quality is worth the extra money for an Apple product
5.0,3 weeks ago,Best Buy,Speaker teamed up perfectly,"Easy to set up; self installed via iPhone and immediately asked if I wanted it to pair with the existing HomePod (yes). Despite the richness of the single speaker, I was able to discern the deeper sound details emerging. It's mate was purchased a year earlier."
5.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Amazing Sound Quality,Purchased the Homepod during one of Best Buy's sales for the product. Heard a lot about the sound quality and it really does sound amazing and fills our living room. Siri is ok and can hear our requests even when we are far away. Recommend at price of $200
5.0,8 months ago,very.co.uk,Great integration,"So happy I bought this. such a great addition to my room. Considering buying another one to have the stereo speaker function. Although iIdon't need to, the audio is first class. Really immersive even when im listening to podcasts."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Outstanding smart speaker,"After using this product for several weeks, it still impressed me every time I play my music on it. It sounds just as good through Apple Play as it does using Apple Music. I love being able to set alarms on it also. The microphones are very sensitive and can almost pick up whispers from the other side of a living room."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Amazing sound quality and user friendly interface.,"I am very impressed with the sound quality of this speaker. Best I’ve heard out of comparable devices. Siri could definitely use a revamp to compete with Alexa and Cortana, but the smart functions for playing music work well. I haven’t connected any other smart home devices so I can’t speak to the performance of these options."
5.0,7 months ago,very.co.uk,Fantastic sound!,"Having had this speaker for over a week now I can safely say I love it! I wanted a speaker purely for its audio and this does not disappoint. I am not really interested in fancy voice commands I just wanted a speaker that was loud and rich in sound and this delivers, very happy!"
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Really handy if you’re in the Apple ecosystem.,"If you’re deep in the Apple ecosystem like I am this speaker is great for you. It can do all the basics that you need, Siri, play music, use Home devices, set alarms, etc. The sound is phenomenal. Definitely would recommend."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Amazing Product,"I genuinely did not know if I would enjoy the HomePod, but I have been thoroughly pleased with the product especially because I have been able to use my Spotify with it. Also, the sound quality and bass provided by the HomePod feels unmatched by any other smart home speaker such as the google home mini or Amazon Echo."
2.0,a year ago,Best Buy,$350 egg timer,On occasion you can control your plug ins but the Leviton little switch’s break within hours. It does play music but so does my TV and it don’t have to buy a subscription. You can’t control the Apple TV and it is very hard to get it to play a radio station. It can’t answer questions. Basically my phone can do all of its functions. I can not understand why I bought it.
4.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Amazing sound! Siri needs to grow up.,"Amazing sound! Sad implementation of Siri. Still worth the price of admission given the extraordinary sonics. I'm fairly certain that Siri will grow up one of these days. The thing that keeps it behind Alexa and Google is the fact that, unlike these cloud-based, breachables, Siri live only on your devise!"
5.0,2 years ago,Argos,Phenomenal Sound,"HomePod almost certainly suited towards iOS/Apple users. It’s essy to set up, looks and feels quality and the sound quality is fantastic given its size. AirPlay 2 will be a massive game changer when it’s released for multi room stereo support. Also, Siri works ok. Not as weak as I thought it was going to be. Siri, could Apple be improving it?!"
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Great Product,"Really enjoying the sound quality that is reproduced by the HomePod, it really is impressive. Rarely use it for commands like commonly used for, like Alexa and Google products. Siri is extremely responsive, with just a whisper while the music is playing loud and she hears you. I would buy it again, and even considering buying another for my bedroom."
4.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Great device if you're in the Apple Ecosystem,"The sound of this speaker is really hard to beat. It has no alternate input, so it can only accept wireless input. Works great for any device capable of Airplay or Airplay2 connectivity."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Exceeded Expectations,"After AirPods became my most used tech device in years, I figured I’d give the HomePod a chance. The Siri functionality is adequate, and will improve over time with updates. However, the sounds you can get right out of the box are insane. FAR above the quality of other smart speakers. Strong recommend for any Apple user."
2.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great sound if ..,"As an Apple fan, I am disappointed in the way this operates. Seldom does Siri provide the song or answer to question asked. We have Apple music but this will not play a song unless it's in a playlist. Don't put it near a TV and watch the news. We see Siri light up when they talk about Syria. They don't say HEY SYRIA but it comes on anyway. Maybe next gen. Time and temp is always good..."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,I love the quality,"So I love apple products, at first, I was not impressed when it came out. But when I heard the sound quality and how good the music sounds it made me want to try it out. I gave myself a week of trying it out as a music speaker and it is totally worth it. I would say if you want it for it to be a smart assistant, I would not recommend it. But if you want a quality speaker, you found the right product."
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Sounds expensive,"Well it’s an Apple product, so you know it must sound amazing. Oh it does. The bass is amazing and this tiny thing is loud enough to hear from rooms away. Unfortunately, you need Apple Music to really get the most out of it. Also, it’s not as smart as Alexa. If you have money to blow, then this is great. I wish i had gotten the Alexa."
5.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Amazing sound for the size,The speaker is such good quality for such a small speaker and the price isn't too bad really. Well if you like good quality. Works best if you have mostly Apple products. But overall it is a really good speaker and Siri is pretty amazing on it. Can pick you up from the other side of a room without shouting.
3.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Limted function with good sound,"I bought this due to great reviews on the sound. I didn't like that anyone in a room can tell the speaker to read off my messages. For the price it isn't worth it. I wanted to like it, but I returned it and got a Sonos Playbar instead. No regrets!"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great speaker!,Would recommend over any other comparable speaker. Very good bass from the speaker and very good separation of bass from miss and treble. This speaker can fill a large room or small room and sound amazing in either situation!
2.0,a year ago,ebay.com,"Superb sound, pitty about Siri","The sound quality at the volumes I use (Not loud) is excellent from Bass to Treble. Siri is terrible. I can repeat Hey Siri - Play Classic FM radio 20 times. It sometimes plays Radiohead, sometimes miscellaneous Classic Music, sometimes says The HomePod cant do that and just occasionally connects to the radio, as asked."
3.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great sounds Big but?,The sound range is among the best BUT there are limitations. You must be committed to Apple products and this is not Bluetooth. IF BBY is offering 4 months of free Apple Music it did not work for me as new subscriber. Disappointed in BBY
3.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Good speaker but costs too muc,As a speaker it’s great but mono effect no real attempt at surround sound. Has a very clear sound both for voice and music. Decent bass and does fill the room. Apple product so you cannot use it as your TV speakers unless using Apple TV. That’s a real shame. Siri is ok but not as good as it’s competitors
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Amazing sound quality!,If you have an iPhone or iPad setup is nearly instant! Easy to use and sound quality makes my Bose Bluetooth speaker sound cheap. Our Amazon echo show is also inferior in sound quality. I’m very pleased.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Another great addition to my Apple ecosystem,"I had been waiting to purchase this speaker until the price was right because I have plenty of other high quality audio options in my home. At $249 on Black Friday, I pulled the trigger. Sound is amazing and it works well with my numerous HomeKit units. Very happy with my purchase and looking forward to more updates in the future from Apple."
5.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Full sound and packs a punch,"Apple doesn’t come cheap but this is a high quality product. The sound quality is amazing on its own, when paired even better. Siri can be frustrating sometimes but you can easily control the speaker with other devices ( IPad, iPhone etc). I primarily use it as a speaker and haven’t explored using Siri as an information source."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Awesome speaker,"Sound quality is really good. The bass packs quite a punch. I also have Sonos home theater setup and this single speaker is almost as good as the whole setup. Siri could do a lot better but am sure Apple will come up with updates. It can hear your voice across the room even with loud music playing. Unlike Sonos, no need to do the trueplay speaker tuning every time you move the speaker. It will auto calibrate. I keep moving it between my bedroom and office room and it sounds great."
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Absolutely Love it!!!,"The quality of the sound is excellent. True to fold, the speakers sound fills up the entire room. The sound is crisp, and the bass is wonderful. I have been compelled to play a lot more instrumental music, I truly feel like I am with the orchestra. Glad I purchased this. The item came when expected. Free shipping too!!!!"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Best home speaker,"Had one for a while now and got this second one during Best Buy's big sale in November. This thing sounds absolutely amazing, but can be a pain setting up with homekit. All in all, you will probably have to reset it multiple times as you get used to working with it in homekit, but once you're all set with it, it's nothing but a big pleasure and convenience to have sitting in your room or wherever you'd want it."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Sounds great and easy setup,This speaker has definitely exceeded my expectations. Setup was straightforward and quick with my iPhone 6s. The sound is better than everything I listened to under $500. My only complaint is the volume levels don’t reach that high but is more than loud enough for apartments and small to medium size rooms.
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Very Happy,"I finally decided to automate my home and decided to give this a try. It was super easy to install and the setup was a breeze. It even talks with my home lawn sprinkler and offers an option to turn the sprinklers on outside if there is smoke detected inside. Doesn't sound like much, but the idea stopping a fire from spreading from home if it ever happens is very comforting. I plan on adding a couple more of these soon."
5.0,7 months ago,Target,Super Awesome Speaker!,"Man i really love this speaker, honestly all i need is padding in my room so that the sound doesn’t echo so much. Love this speaker and how I can use my voice to just play music. The music quality is just outstanding. I just wish it were a bit cheaper."
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Great Sound,"The HomePod , Apple’s new smart speaker is a must have! Siri is capable of many requests. What I like best is the sound from this small device. You can be even a different room to give Siri a command. Love this purchase"
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Great Apple product,"If you already have Apple products, such as I TV, iPhone, iPad or laptop You will love the Apple HomePod. Connect easily with other Apple products and you can simply skin in other Wi-Fi devices and use Apple’s home system"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,incredible Speaker,I was skeptical about spending 350 on a speaker this size. I was not sure if I would go with this Because I already had a Sonos one and Amazon Echo. I am also pretty tied to the Apple Ecosystem. I have to say this speaker sounds absolutely incredible. IMO better than the Sonos one and five. If you use apple music I highly recommend you check it out. Go to a store and hear it for yourself
3.0,2 years ago,very.co.uk,Good sound,First thing I noticed with this HomePod is that it’s wrapped in a type of soft feel honeycomb effect material that’s soft to the touch . I am guessing that it’s a bit of a dust trap and will be an absolute nightmare to clean and will look unclean in time to come . It’s not your usual shiny apple product However it works great and sounds slightly better than the Sonos 1 Ide say it’s slightly over priced and not a great finish overall Also it doesn’t allways respond to Siri requests
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Wow,"I'll get the bad out of the way first...I would love more integration with some of the other services, like Audible, but that is a software thing and Apple tends to work like that, do the basics then add functionality. Now for the sound....absolutely stunning....just amazing sound out of that little speaker. I have a home studio and am an audio guy, and this is just mind blowing, its ability to set itself to the room by listening blows everyone else out of the water."
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Amazing Quality,"I was shocked at how good the quality was! What's even more amazing is that it's able to hear me while the music is blasting! (Note: I did run into some issues where she wasn't able to hear me, that's because I had items surround the home pod which disrupted the ability for it to hear me, after moving it out of the way it works just as it did, so don't put stuff around it ;) )"
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Great expansive sound and seamless integration,The HomePod has expansive sound and works seamlessly with all Apple products. We enjoy playing music over meals and using it as the speaker connected to our Apple TV for movie watching.
5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Apple HomePod is overpriced for now but...,The build quality is impressive and the sound is superb but Siri... need I say more? Siri is dumber on the HomePod than any other Apple device. This has so much potential Apples hardware team did their part now the software team needs to do their part(still waiting for stereo pairing). Value wise I cant recommend yet but it has extreme potential!
4.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Works good so far but very expensive,"Even though it is from Apple, I get a feeling that something is off with this production from Apple. It works good so far but it is super expensive. Worst part was that price dropped from $299 to $199 in two weeks after my purchase & BestBuy didn't do a price match."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Sits on my desk,"It's a fantastic little speaker. I've ignored Apple's recommendation to have it sit 6"" from the wall and simply placed it on the corner of my desk. Sound quality is a huge step up from my Macbook's speakers. The only potential issue is that the HomePod is completely dependent on WiFi, so I've had it lose connection with my iPhone and Mac when my WiFi cuts out."
2.0,3 weeks ago,Best Buy,"Great design, dated functionality","Easy to pair with my iPhone. However, it keeps on unable finding my Playlist. Searching internet does not work either. Hope the speaker is on rechargeable battery instead of hard wired."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Great sound, good hub","Sounds fantastic, the whole family is listening to music more. We already had Apple Music for the family on mobile devices so it made sense for us but, like most review articles say, if you don't have or don't want to get Apple Music, this might not be the best solution. The sound quality sure does provide a reason to get Apple Music."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Well...,"...I waited to long to purchase the Homepod(s) as it is working out better than I expected. Connected to my Apple TV and now also have great rear speakers for my viewing experience. Build quality, design and ease of use makes this a great addition to my tech goodies!"
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Great for Apple fans or users.,Really glad I bought this. It doesn’t disappoint. I like the fact Apple hasn’t rushed this product to market and has waited until it’s reached its high standards. The speaker has a very solid feel and sounds great. Ridiculously easy setup and works great with Apple Music directly with Siri or via airplay with another iPhone / iPad / iPod etc.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Very Convenient,"Siri cant do quite as much as google home, but if you have apple products this is perfect. Play music from your apple music, send and receive calls and texts, and sounds great. Also pairs with Apple TV and you can stream music to it from all devices. Must have for a smart home product if you're in the Apple club."
3.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Kinda meh,"This speaker sounds great, but doesn’t offer a great deal in the ‘smart’ speaker arena. There are very few household items it can control compared to some other smart speakers. It’s very Apple centric to its detriment. If you’re a total Applephile then you’ll love it, but if you’re looking for a smart speaker look elsewhere."
5.0,8 months ago,ebay.com,Exactly what I was after,"I had an Amazon Echo prior to buying this but found that I didnt use a lot of the features, and that the sound quality just wasnt what I wanted. Bought the HomePod and couldnt be happier, the sound quality is great and for the price its nice to have Siri integrated too"
3.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Meh,"Sound quality doesn’t meet my expectations and it does not get anywhere near loud enough for what it’s primary purpose is. Not as multi-functional as any Apple customer would expect of it either. I’m highly disappointed with this one, Apple. Do better!"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Sounds great,"I have all the newer Apple products (series 4 Apple Watch, AppleTV 4K, iPhone XS Max) so I was expecting absolute seamless user interface. But it still has some issues linking up for Airplay. It will work but sometimes takes excessive time to pair up to devices that I’m trying to airplay from. Sound quality is amazing."
4.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Great sound,Picking it up was a suprise - it was heavy but that's because it is full of tech & speakers which means the sound is fantastic regardless of where you put it in the room - apparently it self calibrates. The whole family use it which is great but I can't keep the kids off it.! Haven't asked it more than basic requests but no problem with voice recognition. It is more expensive than others so gave only 4 stars
4.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Okay but not smart,"Comparing with alexa, homepod is so limited, Apple need to make the system working with Spotify not only monopoly just for Apple music. Quality sound is more basses, if you like thump bass this is it. The price I got on sale so worth it."
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Smart speaker extraordinaire,"I absolutely adore this speaker, the quality of sound produced from something this small is truly amazing. Although pricier than some of its rivals, I believe it’s money well spent as the sound is room filling and of a much higher quality than anything close. Well done Apple! I will be purchasing another one and setting them up as a stereo pair."
5.0,4 months ago,Argos,Does what it says on the tin,"if you like everything Apple then this speaker is right up your street. Some would argue expensive, but sound quality is excellent and integration with the rest of your Apple kit is easy. It even turns the lights on so that has to be a bonus !"
3.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Good product but a few blatant limitations,"Setup is a breeze and sound quality is amazing. However, no integration with Amazon Music and other music services. Impossible to cast to the speaker from an Android phone (not everyone in the household has an iPhone Apple!!!!). No control of the volume from your phone o_O. Good option if you have HomeKit devices - the response time is pretty snappy since there's no round trip to the cloud required to control your accessories. Overall, I will stick to Alexa for the ""smart"" aspect of a smart speaker - but for the ""speaker"" part of it, the HomePod is clearly a winner"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Best home speaker,"Apple always makes the best product in my opinion, this is the best speaker I’ve ever used in my house as it synchronizes with my iCloud and Home kit. Only thing I would expect in future would if apple can make this portable, other than that, it sounds so great!"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Awesome some,"These speakers sound great. They sound even better when you have two paired in stereo mode. If you can get them on sale, it’s a great bargain. The apple HomeKit is lacking compared to Alexa and google smart capabilities. Buy this speaker if you’re truly an apple guy that subscribe to Apple Music."
4.0,a year ago,eglobalcentraluk.com,HomePod,Its a good device. Easy to use to airplay from your apple devices.However its very limited just to the apple family devices. I have already got Amazon music and I don't see the reason to say another premium to get apple music.So I have stick to amazon prime music for now. Sound production is good but with loud volume sometimes siri doesn't catch my command. Pitty.
5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,"Sounds great, simple to use, Airplay 2 gives me a whole-house solution.","Small, beautifully designed, and great sound quality. Combined with an Apple Music subscription, this thing was the best solution for my kitchen. When I need whole-house audio, I use Airplay 2 to play the same music from my kitchen and my living room Apple TV home stereo setup."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Awesome Sound, Siri is GREAT","- Sound volume and quality is great. - Siri is a HUGE improvement over what you get with an iOS device. - It’s made well, and is very heavy. - The 6 built-in voice microphones can hear me from anywhere in my house. - Apple’s privacy settings are a major plus. No worrying about what Amazon or Google is going to do with all my information."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Apple Pure Stereo,"Now have best of both Worlds, the JBL Charge for mobil outdoors and the Apple Homepod Twins for the great indoors. Awesome sound, great bass and Siri at your beckon, buy two when the next Price drops to $199.00 Enjoy!"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,a very great smart speaker,"while siri isn’t able to do as much as google home, or amazon alexa, it does what i want it to. i am a constant music listener and this speaker is able to seamlessly play music from my apple music library which is super lovely. the bass is exceptional and the quality is crisp. extremely easy to set up, just brought my phone close."
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Amazing Sound,"An amazing smart home speaker for the money, amazing sound and good features. Pros: Amazing sound, rich bass and clear highs Compact. Can hear you over itself even at really high volumes Cons: Siri not the best but functions very well for most of the features."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Greatest invention ever,Best thing I've ever bought for my home. So nice to add this kind of automation to my life. Works very well. Understands everything I say. Works great with my iPhone. Very usefull.
5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Excellent Value for an Open Box HomePod,"Excellent value, especially if you use current Apple hardware. The latest software update expanded capabilities significantly. For some, the sound may be bass heavy, but it works for me, and listen to a wide variety of music. Easy integration with HomeKit. This open box unit appears new to me."
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Apple Home Pod,"This Home Pod exceeded my expectations completely, if one didn't know any better they would think I had a home theatre system installed in my house, I could compare it to a Bose! don't listen to all of the negative reviews on these until you have tried one for yourself! this is simply amazing and I love it!"
5.0,10 months ago,ebay.com,A great speaker but only if you love Apple,Almost everything great about the HomePod is because youre using Apple only services. Perfect compliment to your existing Apple devices but avoid if youve an Android user or arent completely vested in the Apple ecosystem.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Love it,Very easy to use and sounds great. I use mine for music and my home hub for all of my smart devices including hunter fans lutron caseta switches and audio. Easily stream apple music with no need for a phone or computer ( with apple music subscription)
5.0,3 weeks ago,Best Buy,My second Home pod,"This is my second Home pod purchased in Best Buy, this time I purchased black for my bedroom. Both connect and pair simultaneously. Quality of sound is superb. what else I can said when a purchase the same product."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Big Sound, Small Package!",Great sound quality for the size but for $349 it could be louder. It does best in open spaces due to it always wanting to adjust the direction of the sound. I would recommend it to anyone in any taste in music. I play all types from mainly vocals to bass heavy music with little to no distortion. I mainly recommend this also when on sale.
5.0,3 weeks ago,Best Buy,Love the sound,"These little speakers are Impressive and loud. They do a great job replacing my old 5.1 surround sound speakers, sub and receiver combo. Just wish they worked with more than just the Apple ecosystem though."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Well designed and great speaker,"Disclaimer....I'm all in with Apple products. This was a great addition. I put in my den and request music in a.m. while reading paper. Also check on weather, time etc. Only works with Apple Music tho' which is limit. It is a very good speaker and looks great. Price a little high, but I got on sale at Best Buy and see Costco has on sale now."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,HomePod is Great!,"Despite what the critics (who say the same of every Apple product) say the HomePod is excellent, and a wonderful addition to the Apple ecosystem. Granted, if you use another ecosystem or a variety of tech from different companies the HomePod is not for you. But for someone who uses Apple exclusively and wants a killer speaker that works seamlessly with other Apple products, it is a home run! Siri answers anything I ask appropriately, and the sound quality is superb. Other than for music, I love the ease of pairing it to my Apple TV and filling the room with audio when I'm watching movies. Five stars!"
5.0,2 years ago,very.co.uk,"Fantastic sound, and Siri remarkably good","Lots of reviews of this on other sites comparing the HomePod to the Amazon echoes. Those are a smart assistant with a poor speaker, the focus is always going to be in the voice control and actions. The HomePod is the reverse, sound is the crucial selling point, and that part of the equation blows the competition away, no comparison at all. The Siri assistant is actually better than expected, focus is Apple Music queries, but have it linked up to HomeKit and can control all my Lights (hue and ikea) change temperature on thermostat and also can add items to shopping lists etc"
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,The Best Speakers for Apple TV 4k,"I have Apple TV 4K and let me tell you how amazing this speaker is when you use it with Apple TV 4K! It's the best speaker for Apple TV 4k, the sound is amazing! Especially when you watch live sports and movies!"
4.0,a year ago,Argos,HomePod- good bit not as good as Sonos,"I have Sonos but have an Apple household. Thought this would be great. It’s pretty good, but not great. The only benefit I have is that I can use it to synchronise to my work calendar and pass phone calls to it as I work from home. In all other respects - price, quality, voice activation, I recommend sticking to to Sonos."
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Perfect for the Apple Ecosystem,"Out of all the speakers I've tried, The Apple homepod has always impressed me because its simple, Siri accessable, and it sounds fantastic. I never had issues and the fact that Siri listens for your commands even when playing music is extremely convenient."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,In love,"Ima start by saying the sound is amazing! Is a speaker so that matters most of all... but apart from that I love Siri, how it can control my lights, my Apple TV, how I can ask her everything... the connectivity with all my Apple devices is just beyond cool!"
5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Fantastic sound!,"Bought my first HomePod a few weeks ago to use in my bedroom-cum-office for music & video streaming, and home control. So impressed that I've got another couple to pair up in stereo to replace a bulky cinema surround system in my living room. Set up is simple, the sound quality is excellent and ""room filling"", yet the HomePod is small and unobtrusive. Thoroughly recommended."
5.0,3 weeks ago,Best Buy,Awesome in Stereo,"Sounds great, even better if you subscribe to Apple Music. Now it can play the radio directly. Will be even better if it can play directly from other sources i.e. Bluetooth. It does play from Apple TV."
5.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,The HomePod is a great product,The HomePod has become central to our day to day life. It plays any song we have wanted to hear since purchasing. The information available for the asking has been invaluable in some circumstances. I don’t know how we managed before the HomePod.
2.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Amazing sound but Siri is dumber than on iPhone,"We wanted to love the HomePod but after testing it for a day, found that the sound was excellent but Siri was too limited and annoying, so we returned it and purchase Google Home Max instead. Siri could do very basic things like tell the time, the weather, or set a timer but most of the time she got music choices wrong and couldn't find albums in my Apple Music account. Apple shipped this half-baked and the smart assistant isn't smart at all."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Awesome Sounding Smart Speaker,Love this speaker the technology automatically sets it up for the best sound no matter where you place it. Siri will play all your Apple Music and you can stream any other source from your iPhone or iPad. You can also use it with your AppleTV. Once Apple updates it with more assistant features it will be awesome.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Love It!,"I wasn't sure about the HomePod, but I figured I could return it if I didn't enjoy it as the price is a little steep. Turns out that I love it and use it more than my Bose sound bar. I use ""Hey Siri"" to control my homes lighting and for playing music. The actual speaker is pretty incredible and easily fills the living room/dining/Kitchen from a tucked away location. It's barely noticeable."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"The sound is amazing, room for improvement","I'm a dyed-in-the-wool Apple apologist of 30 years and I will tell you that the HomePod is a lovely, lovely invention. The sound, especially when paired with another HomePod, is really something to behold. There is work to do to improve the HomePod version of Siri, which I hope Apple will do soon, as updates have helped incrementally."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great but,"For 350 - I can’t justify it. For 250, I really like it. I bought two at that sale price and the sound is great when they are paired. One is very good but not great. Muddy mids. Two is another game altogether. I don’t care about the smart speaker stuff so didn’t care how expansive siri is or is not. Would buy another - at 250."
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Super satisfied,Home pod connects through Bluetooth and uses Siri. Just like the “hey Alexa” home pod uses “hey Siri” and I like how I don’t always have to find my phone or manually do it. The sound is amazing. It is loud and really balanced.
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Obsessed!,"I absolutely LOVE the sound quality of the HomePod. I can hear it all over my house. Also, it can hear you say “hey Siri” even over the loudest volume. I use it so much, it’s so great to have instant access anytime verbally."
5.0,2 weeks ago,Best Buy,Beautiful Sound,"I think I listened to every speaker, and finally settled on the Apple HomePod. It looks beautiful and sounds beautiful and was priced right. Very high quality. I have it on most of the day. Brings joy into my home."
5.0,9 months ago,bestbuy.ca,Best Sound for a Smart Speaker,"This is my speaker for watching movies and it produces the best sound! I appreciate that Siri is always there and ready to answer basic questions. Apple will release updates as time goes on, but it still outdoes the competition."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Don’t buy the negative reviews,Yes I’m a fan boy. Yes I love apple. I also like nice things that work in general. This just happens to be one of those. It’s a premier product that - if you’re in the Apple ecosystem - is untouched. I have multiple soundlinks from Bose (love them) but this has the Apple Music thing down. If you can spare the 400 get one.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Great sound, perfect for small rooms","The sound is exceptional for such a small speaker. This is the first speaker anywhere near this size that I could imagine using as my primary music source in a small room. Siri works very well, and we're using it as the hub for a number of smart devices now without any problem. It may be pricey, but it is a great product."
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Awesome speaker for the home.,"I have wanted one of these s8mce it came out, it didn’t like the $349 price tag. So when it dropped to $250 I jumped on it. I love the speaker and the clarity. Siri is pretty efficient for what she is allowed to do. At $250 it was well worth the money spent."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Outstanding, as expected","Finally decided to go for it. With all my other Apple devices, it was anticipated to, and so far has, exceed(ed) my expectations. Great quality. Expensive, yes. Best sound ever experienced. Hoping for Siri updates to make it even better. Not yet purchased smart bulbs to go with it. But, next."
1.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Siri is painfully stupid,"I should have known Siri on HomePod would be as poor as on iPhone. The thing is, on iPhone I can choose not to use it, but on HomePod it’s sort of the point. Siri doesn’t understand basic questions like “what radio stations can you play” (it can play a set of UK stations if you ask for them in the right way) or “switch off” (only understand turn off) etc etc. The whole process quickly becomes painful, and I wish I hadn’t bought it."
1.0,4 months ago,Argos,The item was second hand!,Travelled 1 hour out of my way to collect the item. Argos had reboxed the device and tried to palm it off as brand new. It had and EU power cord! It had also been registered with Apple as well as no manual and had a poor attempt at repackaging.
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Surprisingly Quality Sound,"I’m a Apple consumer, so it was a great addition to compliment my other apple products. I still love my Sonos speakers and I wish Sonos would have Siri capabilities, so this is the only reason I purchased a set."
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Wonderful investment!,I’m getting a second one for the living room! It’s pricey but Apple always is and I’m glad I took the plunge. It’s loud enough to hear throughout the house but I’m wondering what possibilities await me with two! I may never need a DJ again!
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,The sound is amazing!!,"I didn't have high hopes for this. When they demo it in the store, it always ""sounds"" amazing. But then you get home and its not quite the same. But I was super impressed how good it sounds. Very clear and high quality sound from it, for just 1 speaker. Couldn't really tell the difference between this and my stereo system."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Apple makes great things,"The HomePod rocks. My son complained to me last night that I was too loud. I have many speakers. Bose, Polk etc. The sound link II sounds good but flat compared to the HomePod. This blows them all away. Don't even bring Echos, Homes, dots to the party. Keep them at home in shame. The sound is loud and clear. Fills our large living home nicely. The engineering behind this thing rocks. As with any Apple product it looks great."
4.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Great sound in small space,"I replaced a 1 cubic foot subwoofer amplifier, 2 speakers and 4 cables with the compact HomePod with its single power cable. Easily plays music, any audio with excellent sound quality from MacBook, iPhone. It’s also a major Siri portal but I mostly care about the audio. Very impressed."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great sound speaker,"Ok, so lets get it out of the way. If you have apple system in your home then you this is a must. great sound, my kids love it when they can play all the music they want, but you have to have apple music. Not only is it expensive, but the added expense of apple music does not help. But since i'm wrapped in apple ecosystem it's a great buy."
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Spectacular sound,"This is not an Alexa or Google Home. Siri has limitations on web data. However, if you subscribe to Apple Music this is a must. Sound is bigger than the size of this device and has great bass. I use it everyday"
5.0,5 days ago,Best Buy,Looove it,"I love my homepod. I use it alllll the time, so much more than I thought I was going to use it. I like the amount of bass that it contains as well. Being able to ask Siri anything anytime, whether your phone is near by or not, is a great feature too!"
5.0,a year ago,Argos,“Hey Siri take a Bow”,WOW! This speaker is amazing. Sound quality is just fantastic. Bass boost is awesome and Siri just makes it a whole lot better. Combine this with Apple Music and it’s all you’ll need in a home speaker. If you have Apple TV you can use it as a home theatre speaker too via AirPlay. You won’t regret paying the price for this.
4.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Great sound but only really works with apple,"I have two homepods, they sound great when paired together but they crash all of time. You can not use paired speakers with macbook other than with itunes. Hardware is great, software sucks."
5.0,a year ago,Argos,"Sounds amazing, perfect addition",Another awesome premium product from apple. I’m heavily into the apple eco system anyway so that was a main draw to me buying this product although I’m aware there are potentially cheaper products that offer the same kind of sound. Just do your research before jumping in as the lack of aux or Bluetooth streaming may not be for you.
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Great speaker with added bonus of being smart,The speaker looks stylish and fits in well with my lounge decor. The sound quality is excellent. It is easy to control via voice commands. I haven't used Siri much apart from weather forecasts which have been accurate. I have been able to connect my i-phone to it easily.
5.0,9 months ago,Overstock.com,"No set up needed. Just plugged it in and held my phone near it. The sound is nothing short of amazing, and I'm surprised it can pick up my siri commands while the volume is almost at max. Tried to get another one, but they sold out of these before I could get it that cheap again.","No set up needed. Just plugged it in and held my phone near it.

5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Great External Speaker for iMac,"I was looking for some external speakers for my new iMac. I tried other wireless options, but the delay between screen and speakers was too long. The HomePod fixes that issue and it sounds great."
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Perfect for the Apple ecosystem!,"With this new iOS 13 update coming soon, this device will be getting even better, but I already love this! For the price you get something that ties in seamlessly with HomeKit and Apple Music. Above all, the sound quality is impeccable."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,"Beautiful sound, great multi room","I bought this to replace a Sonos system that constantly went out of sync when playing in multiple rooms. The HomePod has no sync issues and sounds better, it fills the room better than Sonos."
5.0,3 weeks ago,Best Buy,Great sounding speaker,"Easy to set up; self installed via iPhone. Most of my music is older and not available on the match app so the speaker links to my iPhone for the times I want to listen to those, or to the match for more modern tunes. Siri has been improved too."
5.0,7 months ago,Target,Apple HomePod number 2,"Standard outstanding quality of Apple products. Exceptional sound from a small, compact speaker. Great depth and is outstanding when using two. Stereo at it's best."
5.0,5 months ago,BLINQ,First Experience with BLINQ . . . Excellent,This is my first purchase with BLINQ and everything went smoothly. I love the HomePod and hope to get another on in the near future. The product arrived undamaged. It looks and acts like a brand new product.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great quality sound,I purchased a pair of these speakers for a stereo effect and was able to mount them centrally I in a large living area. Beautiful sound from every spot of the room and even into other areas. Defininitely would do it all over again!!
3.0,a month ago,Best Buy,HomePod failure!,I purchased this item Black Friday 2019. I returned it after 10 days of trying to get it connected to my internet. I kept getting error messages and I did everything google suggested. Overall I love Apple products wish I could have gotten it to work.
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Well made. Great sound.,Smart piece of technology and is well made. Well worth the outlay and I bought a cover too so as to keep clean when not in use. Voice commands understood most of the time and Siri can tell you lots of interesting knowledgeable stuff as well to playing your music. So really pleased and would recommend.
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Great for Music, Dumb for a Smart Speaker","The Apple HomePods sound great, no doubt. But they are dumb for a smart speaker / digital assistant. This rating is for the sound quality, not for the functionality as a digital assistant."
5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Superior Sound!,"While the Siri functionality is not up to par yet with Alexa and Google, this speaker produces THE best sound! Period! You will not believe the bass sound this small speaker pumps out! I have experience with Bose, Alpine, Harmon Khardon, JBL, etc., etc. nothing beats the sound this speaker makes! Highly recommend!"
5.0,2 weeks ago,Best Buy,Amazing sound.,HomePod has amazing sound for a smart home speaker. Plus with Siri integrated it fits perfectly with the Apple ecosystem. If you own an iPhone I couldn’t recommend you buy this more over any other speaker.
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Amazing sound,"For the size, this speaker has a lot of heft and powerful sound. Planning on getting a 2nd one when Airplay 2 comes out. I can easily play music from iTunes on any of my Apple devices, and although I don't use Siri that much, it's responsive and has accurately responded with news or music play directions. Be aware that Siri will only respond to you, and be recognized by the Home app, if you've turned on 2-factor authentication, which is a pain w/Apple."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Amazing Clarity,"Years ago, I had an expensive audio system carefully put together by experts. Unbelievably, Apple has created a speaker that replicates the high fidelity of that audio system. Finally, I can truly enjoy the incredible assortment of music genres available by a simple voice command."
1.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Do not buy.,I had it for less than 2 minutes and out of the box it didn’t wanna work. I got it set up an hour later of this garbage not working and than it wouldn’t sync with the Apple Home app and constantly screwed up my requests. I tried it on 3 devices. All apple. Terrible. And the box is just stupid garbage. You can’t even put it back in the package. Just save yourself money and a return to Apple.
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Wow! Blown away by how good these sound.,This is my 2nd HomePod purchase. I wanted to expand by being able to use another one in a different room or pair as a stereo in same location. Boy was I blown away by how good these sound when paired as stereo!
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great but could be improved,"I know this is first generation, but I have an Echo and function-wise it is much better than HomePod. Siri is just not that great, unfortunately. BUT, the sound on this thing is fantastic. If you want to fill a room with great music, get a HomePod. Looks great too and is surprisingly heavy."
4.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,This speaker sounds good,"It sounds good, but not sure I would spend money on it again. I was really hoping Apple would make further investments into more speakers and create a Sonos type environment. Not so for so not sure I would buy any more."
4.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Amazing sound!,"Absolutely incredible sound. Zero distortion at max volume. Deep bass and solid treble. I’m already part of the Apple ecosystem, so a no brainer. I just wish it was a bit louder."
5.0,2 years ago,very.co.uk,Excellent sound and voice recognition,"HomePod is allot smaller than I was expecting, I have a Sonos Play 5 although it’s not quite as good in the sound department as my Sonos the sound that some from the small spherical speaker is amazing! Having Siri is a great help and she can hear me every time I speak, whereas Alexa sometimes has trouble hearing me over loud music. Would deffo recommend to anyone within the Apple ecosystem. Siri just needs a few updates to be as useful as she can be. As Alexa cuter my has the edge."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Amazing sound, not smart","Homepod is amazing when it comes to sound quality. So clear, loud, and crisp. You cannot go wrong with it if you are only interested in sound. However, Siri is not good and it does not connect to other users. I think Apple was focused on hardware and they are depending on software updates to improve the software."
5.0,7 months ago,ebay.com,Great sound but best for those firmly in the Apple ecosystem,Sound is excellent and it recalibrated itself to its position in the room when moved. Makes a great external speaker for my iMac. Going to buy a second one to have a stereo pair.
3.0,2 months ago,John Lewis,For Apple Music subscribers only!,"For its size, you can’t fault the quality of the sound but it’s almost useless unless you subscribe to Apple Music. As a family with Spotify accounts we’re not prepared to switch and lose all our music libraries so the speaker is getting returned."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Apple home pod,Amazing... the apple home pod highly recommend to everybody sound good when you play music it feel I like your inside a night club. You connect the Apple TV and use it as a home theatre and the sound comes out high quality.
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Does what you expect and more,First off. Sound quality is fantastic. Do not judge by a in store demo. Buy it and try at home. You will be blown away. As for Siri it’s great with room to grow. The best part is you don’t need to yell for Siri to hear you. In fact you can whisper or talk from other side of room. And very natural voice. Unlike other SSpkrs.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,High quality sound....NAILED IT!!,I bought the HomePod to try it out and I was literally shocked by how great it sounded. It fills the room with high quality sound and works seamlessly with all my Apple products. The design is very compact and in my opinion better looking and less bulky than other speakers out there. I would recommend!!
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Very bulky and heavy,"When I first bought this, I had the Amazon Alexa, but I would still rather have Alexa over this. I am a huge apple fan, as I have the latest MacBook Pro, Apple Watch, iPhone X, iPad Pro, Apple Pencil, but the HomePod could use work. It sounds and works great, but it can't order you things, make phone calls. On top of that, it has no personality traits and can not access wifi lightbulbs."
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Wow sound,Like I said. WOW SOUND. couldn’t be happier with Apple. The sound that I get out of this little speaker blows me away. My wife bought my first one for my computer room and everybody loved it so I got one for the downstairs
5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Amazing sound,"Amazing sound, you cant get anything sounding half as good at twice the price. I was able to compare it side by side with the acclaimed Naim Muso cube; not only is the Muso difficult to place in a room, but the HomePod sounded more natural and did not experience drop-outs. The Amazon, Google and Sonos speakers dont even begin to compare. For anyone in the Apple ecosystem its a no brainer choice."
3.0,a year ago,ebay.com,"Good sound and Apple integration, but HomeKit needs more features for controlling other Apple devices","Siri still has a bit of a ways to go in understanding certain sentence structures, but it integrates well with Apple services. Apple HomeKit still needs a bit of work to do things like open apps or videos on TVs. The sound quality is good overall."
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Love these,Are these for audio files... no. They sound very nice for the package size and I love how Siri/HomeKit interacts with them. Worth the price and sound better than many of the other options. The simple set up is a amazing.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Excellent sound!,Bought this for my grandson and his wife. They often have friends over for game night and he was using his phone for background music. Now he can play his music using this machine. He’s thrilled!
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Sounds great. Really handles the bass wonderfully.,Sounds great. Really handles the bass wonderfully. I’ve been using two of them in conjunction with my Apple TV to create surround sound and it works perfectly.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great sound all round !,"I got two HomePods to place on both sides of the end and I was astonished by the sound quality and bass from these little speakers. Overall worth the price! Siri isn’t that intelligent as Alexa but she gets the job done, assistant wise. As for audio the HomePod beats all other virtual assistant speakers I’ve owned."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Amazing Sound!,I’m pretty much wrapped in the apple ecosystem so I use iCloud music frequently. The HomePod is a great addition to the Apple products already own. It works well with the iPhone iPad and MacBook Pro and the sound is amazing. I would like a little more bass but the speaker fills the room nonetheless.
4.0,a year ago,Argos,Slightly disappointed.,Don’t get me wrong. It better than any Bluetooth speaker out there but it didn’t really blow my wig off. It’s very well made and the sound is great but it’s just not that loud. Siri works great too. Maybe I expected too much from it but that’s Apple hype for ya. Two in tandem would be amazing but your getting into silly money then.
5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,I love it,"Of course, I have two iPhones, 4 iPads, 2 MacBooks and 4 Mac desktops, 3 Apple TVs. My iTunes Match library is enormous. I dont watch TV, I watch Apple TV. This speaker sounds great and its a perfect match for my hardware and software. If you are invested in the Apple ecosystem, you cant go wrong."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Incredible sound for its size and price,"I was initially skeptical of the HomePod but after using it for several weeks I think it's a fantastic speaker. The sound is incredibly rich and projects in all directions. While Siri isn't perfect and is actually restricted in the HomePod compared to the iPhone, the controls work pretty well and it picks up my voice nearly everywhere."
5.0,3 months ago,John Lewis,Perfect!,"The HomePod is as title says perfect! The sound, style and overall ease of use is perfect! I had the Alexa and dropped it after 1 month as the sound quality was poor and Alexa kept mishearing. This is well worth the money."
5.0,2 years ago,very.co.uk,Perfect addition to the AppleEcosystem,"The sounds quality is outstanding for the price point. Siri does need some work, but I imagine that is just a software update away. If you use iTunes Match or iTunes Music then this is the speaker for you. If you use an alternative music streaming service, you’re not going to get the full benefit, although you can stream from your iPhone and control apps like Siri by voice. My speaker is sat on a wooden shelf, and so far have no issues with marking."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great addition to an Apple home,Fits in perfectly with all my other Apple products. I work from home and have been told on conference calls the sound is better than when I was using my speaker on my iPhone and there is no more sound feedback too.
1.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Horrible speaker,"I have purchased 2 of these speakers, and the do not respond. If they do respond when saying “Hey Siri”, it is after the 10th time. I have performed a factory reset, and the same issues persist. What a waste of $700 for 2- speakers."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Speaker first, smart speaker second","Amazing sound. Siri is limited based on how the individual uses her. If you use Siri a lot, she gets more useful over time. Bass is solid, mids and highs are tempered and clear. The speaker sounds amazing from ever section of the room! Pairing is super easy!"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,good idea but just ok,so far I would say the best thing is of course the sound and we have apple music already as a family so I figured I would try it out. I also have the echo and google smart speakers. this one is best for sound. google is best for answering questions and echo for notifications about the constant amazon packages we seem to get
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,"Great looks, great sound, just works!","As with most all the Apple products I have. They are excellent. Sure you can get a cheaper speaker, but none sound and work better. It is fun to use and Siri is much improved from days gone by."
4.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,"Great sound, stereo pairing is nice.","Overall I think these are the best sounding smart speaker I have used. I got a second to add more coverage in my home, and to occasionally use them in stereo. Great if you’re in the Apple ecosystem. A bit pricey."
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,"Solid, but Sonos was better.",Good speaker solid performance but Sonos not only sounded better but was 50 dollars cheaper. It should be noted that somehow the Sonos worked more seamlessly with my iPhone and music apps including Apple Music.
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Amazing sounds quality,I’m blown away by the sound of this speaker for the size that it is. This could easily compete with some of the more high end speakers like Bose or Naim. It’s not a smart device so controlling your home won’t be an option for it but it’s a convenient way to extend the use of Siri and it pairs with your Apple TV as the speaker and some limited controll functions.
5.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Beautiful product.,"On par quality-wise with AirPods Pro, sound is brilliant, Siri is eerily more human with seemingly new verbal ticks, Siri digital swirling led indicator atop very H.A.L.-like. It works so well with HomeKit anything and Apple Music."
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Fidelity Dissapointing,I expected the quality of the sound to be much better. Using mostly to play Apple Music service. It appears that Apple chooses to supply lower resolution sound. Like MP3. From reviews I expected full range. PS: I am not ready for Suri (or Alexa) to spy on me all day. Have feature OFF.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Excellent speaker,I love my Apple HomePod. The sound quality is amazing. Has great bass and crisp clear sounds. Perfect pair for my Apple TV. This things so loud that if I bought another it would blow my Bose home theatre speaker out the water. Overall great speaker
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Easy set up and easy/fun to use,It was easy to set up the Home Pod and it becomes something to ask our random questions to so we've come to depend on it. It's handsome and blends in with our kitchen. Its plug in cord is thick and supple which gives it a durable look.
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Amazing Sound Quality,"I am very impressed the quality of these speakers. The mid range and the base are very well balanced. There I things I can hear using the Homepods I never noticed using my pair of Braven 850s. Plus even at 100% volume there is barely any distortion. Yes, it requires Airplay. That make sense given that the algorithms employed need lossless audio digital data that only Airplay can deliver. I have noticed no issues using airplay to stream Spotify."
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Better than a sound bar,Love it! I also have whole home surround sound in the ceiling and I prefer this sound better. Going to get another one too!! Great sound and Siri is a huge plus!! We use it as a hub for a smart house!
2.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Not a fan,I love apple products and I have different things that have all been great but this was too bulky. Did not like it and didn’t like that it had to use WiFi not just blu tooth. Great sound but not worth the price. Was returned the same day.
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Sounds awesome!,"Great speaker however don’t use Best Buy’s shipping, it came late the tracking sucked and the product box and outer box were severely dented! I will never have a Best Buy product shipped again! Apple HomePod is awesome!"
5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,"Great sound, Siri needs a little work","As for the sound: I have no idea how they got such a solid low end to the music, not boomy, just smooth lows, and the vocal are super clear, its a pleasure to listen to. As for the tech: Siri is not as refined as the Google assistant. It does work with Spotify and other music apps, but its best with Apple Music because its built in, with 9.99 a month subscription mind you."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Buy two!,"Awesome sounding speaker that will only get better. This is my second HomePod... and I’m very happy with my decision to get a second. When in stereo mode they sound amazing. The sound is clear and the bass is spot on. One HomePod is great, but two in stereo mode is perfect. If you’re a music lover with high fidelity... try it out!"
5.0,5 months ago,walmart.com,Sonically fantastic,"Get two, they’ll blow your mind. Siri isn’t the smartest but the light and music control with the sound quality makes it all worth it. I went to school for sound engineering and can tell these are definitely worth the money sonically."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Best home speaker I have ever heard!!!,HOMEPOD sounds amazing! Crisp clear sound with great bass. Siri can hear you so well....and not having to keep saying hey Siri....she hears you the first time unlike my kids. Does all the smart home stuff I need could not be happier. The HOMEPOD is shockingly small with a good quality build quality feel. Have never had a echo or google device because of security concerns..... all products I buy support HomeKit. Would buy again no doubt!
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,The sound is amazing!,"I had my doubts about the usefulness of Apple’s HomePod. We have used Google assistant and Alexa. Both have their pros and cons. Apple isn’t without that, but the sound is amazingly superior. I gladly play music on this all day long. It even rivals my Sonos speakers."
3.0,11 months ago,ebay.com,Worth your money,"The product is fine, hasn't any obvious issue. But the plug has obvious scratch. No introduction and warranty card in the box. Should call it pre-owned product. Overall, worth money."
3.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,I wanted to like it but...,I really wanted to like it but just couldn't. I guess i've got used to working with the google assistant and alexa. The speaker is pretty good but its not so smart. The inability to recognize multiple voices is a big security risk. Not being able to play spotify directly (can do it via airplay) and Siri as a whole is a big letdown. This is not ready for primetime. I bought two of them and returned and got two sonos one instead. The three stars are for the sound it produces.
4.0,2 weeks ago,Best Buy,Great smart speaker for music,The speaker has a really good sound quality and has new voice control that also for certain radio stations to play if you have the radio app installed on your apple device. Only downside is the siri on your phone gets confused with the speaker when trying to speak to the speaker
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Mainly used as a speaker - love it!,"We used this primarily as a speaker in our main living room - fantastic sound. We have Apple Music running through it most of the time, which has been nice. I really can't compare it to other similar products, but we've been happy with it so far."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Love this speaker!,"I’m glad I picked up one of these. Based on how I’ve positioned it in my home, it helps bathe my home in music. Combined with the AppleTVs, this speaker perfectly compliments my sound system. Yes, there are less expensive sound systems out there but if you’re tied into Apple ecosystem, you’ll appreciate adding one (or more) to your home."
3.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Not That Good,These Speaker is ok but to much Money. I will get another one so i can have the sound in Stereo. I like the Google Max much better or the Sonos there ok also but there not the greatest thing also. Iam a new Costumer for Apple Products just getting started. Its just to bad that that Apple Speaker does not sound much better. only 3 stars
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great Speakers,"These speakers are top quality sounding speakers. The bass is full & crisp, along with great treble sounds. Clearly a richer sound than most other smart speakers."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Amazing sound, but limited Siri.","Apple did a wonderful job fitting such great sound into a small speaker. The bass sounds great anywhere I stand in the room. However, the Siri functions are very limited. The sound alone is a reason to get a speaker though, and I'm sure Apple will add more Siri functions over time."
4.0,a year ago,very.co.uk,Great sound,Really good sounding speaker. I use it mostly for low level listening and the homepod does the job well. Siri needs more work as some requests for certain songs or artists bring up some peculiar results. I usually end using airplay which I prefer. Overall a great product.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Wow.,This speaker sound is closer to some of the speakers that are offered through magnolia. While I don’t find voice assistants helpful I rarely use Siri and I use the HomePod for a speaker when I have people over. The speaker is very clear with a good amount of bass and the full volume oh my god. No distortion at all. Great quality all around.
5.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Little cylinders of goodness,"These are great, they're unobtrusive visually but sound fantastic. The Siri feature is useful but not the main element. The sound is significantly better (imho) than the Sonos One or equivalent. I'm really enjoying them and glad that I picked these."
4.0,a year ago,Currys,Linda's review of Apple HomePod,"Pros: Love the connection to Apple Music and the speed your requests are granted! Cons: Dose not always understand your requests, which can be quite amusing or frustrating. But you need to learn how to phase them. Haven’t yet worked out how to sync more than one phones playlist. The only music radio stations is beats!"
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Great Sound and Features,Perfect compliment to my living room. Sound is amazing and I ability to connect it my other Apple products is a major plus. Getting weather reports or selecting music in a split second is even better.
5.0,a year ago,samsclub.com,HomePod,I have two of these and I’m looking to get a third. Sound quality is very good and interaction with my home automation is amazing. I can be anywhere in the house and even with just having the two speakers I can request Siri to turn on whatever automation I want and it works perfectly the only time I have trouble is when there’s a lot of background noise not coming from the HomePod.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Excellent sound quality,"While interested, I had been reluctant to get a HomePod given the price premium, so when it went on sale I snapped one up and I’m very pleased that I did. Amazing sound quality and microphones that can hear my voice even when music is playing makes for a good experience. So easy to set up as well, as it used the settings from my phone during initializing."
5.0,8 months ago,Overstock.com,"Great product! Only thing is I wish they wouldve tapped the HomePod box cuz when I opened the shipping box and took it out the HomePod fell out... but that was partly due to my clumsiness as well.

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Siri with Sound Quality,"If your looking for this to be just a Smart Speaker to ask questions look somewhere else, but if you want a great speaker with some smarts to control your music and homekit stuff this is awesome. I can't believe the sound quality in such a small speaker. This thing isn't google smart but Apple doesn't do search, so it is a niche product for sure."
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,I love this speaker,If you are part of the Apple ecosystem then this is a no brainer. The sound is awesome and Siri is getting better and better. The only issue I have is that airplay loses connection after using it for a long period of time.
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,All these reviews are fake!,"Not one single review is from a verified purchaser except for me :). The HomePod blows away any other smart speaker in terms of sound quality. The Clarity and Bass will amaze you for about 10 minutes. To answer your question, Yes...Siri is still stupid. But that’s fine. Oh yeah when using FaceTime audio, the HomePod is the best speaker phone on the planet. :). I will always buy anything and everything that Apple releases. I spare no expense!"
5.0,9 months ago,Argos,Brilliant,"We love the home pod, the sound is so clear and crisp. If you have a Apple TV you can also use it as a sound bar and it’s great while watching films. Another feature we love is, you can ask Siri to dj for you. Works great with home kit as well."
5.0,a year ago,Target,"Great product, packaging not new","Great product but the packaging it was in was obviously not from a new item. Apple products always come wrapped in thin plastic to protect the boxes and to show it hasn't been opened. The box I got from Target that the HomePod came in was clearly opened because the plastic wrap was missing, although the item itself appeared to be new."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Sound! Siri is Pretty Good,"I am very pleased with the sound quality. It fills whatever room I have it in. If you are in the Apple ecosystem then this is the smart speaker for you! The microphones pickup your voice really well, and Siri is improving with the shortcuts application."
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great product,Bought two of them and the music quality is fantastic! The only guideline I subtract is its functionality. These days the dot and home devices have become much better I fail to see the overall usefulness of the product.
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Love Apple Homepod,I’m a big Apple person. Speaker is pricey but well worth it. Sounds good and powerful. Would recommend having Apple Music subscription. Would suggest doing a little research before buying. There is no Bluetooth option but iPhone can connect using Airplay.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Excellent sound. Perfection at its finest.,"At the beginning I was kind of skeptical about spending $350 in a speaker, but was already so developed in the Apple ecosystem I knew it would have to be done. I am beyond satisfied with my purchase and it exceeds all my exceptstions across the board. Worth every penny and I love it. So I’m begging you to spend your 35,000 pennies as well!!"
4.0,a year ago,Argos,Great speaker,This was touted as apple toe in to smart speaker as a smart speaker it’s not the best and most of the time Siri on my phone is quicker and more easy to use. The speaker quality on these things is amazing! I now have two and thinking of getting a third soon. Be aware to set this up you have to have an iPhone. And to get the most of it an Apple subscription is required.
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Awesome stereo with pairing,"Bought first HomePod as early adopter... Is a good single speaker and Apple Music has me listening to tons of new songs. With the second HomePod and pairing, the sound is incredible. I use with AppleTV for enhanced audio with my entertainment system."
5.0,4 months ago,Argos,Apple does it again,Another class product from Apple. If you live in the world of Apple the HomePod will fit right in with quality deep sound and a small clean modern design. Siri needs work but will get better with updates.
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,The Home pod is amazing!,"I love that the HomePod has the capability to grant every request I ask of it by just saying “Hey Siri”. Also, the Lyfx bulbs work exceptionally well with the home pod. I truly feel like I have an imaginary assistant!"
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,I Love It!,"Well this speaker is very nice, I have a few Sonos speakers around the house & decided to give this a try. Now I’m thinking about selling my Play 1’s & replacing them with Apple Home Pods. But I will keep my Play 5’s in my Man Room, the Home Pod doesn’t sound nearly as good as the Play 5’s."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"1 small step for Apple, 1 giant leap for mankind.","Purchased this on sale for $249.99 and I am totally loving the product. It is the sole object on my night stand now and it definitely fills every corner of the room with rich sound. Hearing it in store is much different but definitely pull the trigger if you love music and have, of course, Apple Music."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great product,"Nice looking sound system fits nicely in any decor. Incredible sound, better than my old system that was twice the cost. Good response from Siri on all subjects. A must have for Apple product fans"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,LOVE this product,"We purchased 2 of these for our living room. We can ask Siri to play anything (we have an Apple Music subscription), which makes this even more fun. She actually listens and understands us. We can make her turn the music up or down, the sound is great, and we have it hooked into our Apple TV so we can also use it for surround sound for the TV when we want. Love this product!!!"
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Great sounds!,"I already had Apple Music on my iPhone and iPad and was looking at the HomePod for awhile, but my wife was looking at Amazon Echo. I bought this, took it home and set it up. When my wife heard the sound quality, she was amazed. We love it."
5.0,6 months ago,officeworks.com.au,Fantastic Sound,Been using this product for several months and I continue to be blown away by the amazing sound quality. Very easy to use with Apple music as well. Makes it easy to control my smart home from one central location
4.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,"great sound, little else","I got this primarily as a speaker for the kitchen to listen to while I cook or while we eat. It serves that purpose well. As far as a smart speaker goes, it's got Siri, so anything you are used to with Siri you can use on the speaker."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great sound!,By far the best sound of the speakers i have been using. It is an extension of the Apple world so it is essentially an airplay speaker. Unlike Echo you can't simply ask it to play NPR or Spotify or Satellite radio. I have an ipad next to it and use it as the source. Also got it when it was on sale for $250 which made more sense .
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Decent,"Good sound when using Airplay 2, however there's noticeable sound deterioration when streaming. Siri OK. Also sound lag when Airplaying from Safari on Mac. Too bad."
5.0,6 months ago,ebay.com,Audio Star,The HomePod truly a tech wonder. How so much sound comes from this small device is a marvel. I even have it AirPlaying the sound from tv shows and it sounds crisp. I cannot wait to purchase another one and stereo pair them
3.0,8 months ago,ebay.com,"Looks good, sounds bad","It definitely looks used but not horrible. The sound though, not good. Even when volume is low, bass is so busted that it rattles every beat. Not even worth listening to."
5.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,"Easy Setup, Excellent sound",We bought two of these so that we could use them upstairs and downstairs in our house. We were able to stream music off of Spotify and play it to both speakers simultaneously over airplay. Sounds awesome!
1.0,a month ago,Currys,Craig's review of Apple HomePod,"Cons: Does nothing, but play music. It’s aimed to compete against google home and Alexa. Trust me it’s nowhere near advanced. Apple have made a completely useless dud"
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Mixed feelings - Apple HomePod,"I have mixed feelings with this homepod. I like that it works very well with Apple's ecosystem. However, it's very limited compared to Sonos speakers. I have the Sonos Playbar and One and this Homepod is nothing compared to them. The sound is okay, but not great."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Best speaker out there!,"I recently purchased a second homepod to utilize the stereo sound feature that comes with owning a pair. These speakers sound great on their own, but stereo sound is truly the way to go. They are extremely simple to pair and begin using and sound incredible! Very pleased with my purchase."
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Great,The sound projects well it’s good over all that’s a pretty deep sound a lot of bass Siri is excellent isn’t as knowledgeable as Alexa yet I’m mostly use this while my dad was on hospice It took him a while to realize he could ask the HomePod what the weather was going to be it was pretty funny. “Hey Siri what’s the weather?”
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Glad i waited but now i wish i hadn't,Got it on sale and couldn't believe how much i love using it . Im an Apple addict so i have just about everything Apple and i love Apple music and it works great with my video speaker system and Apple TV so its a win win. Ive turned it way up and its clear and clean sound is super.
1.0,a year ago,very.co.uk,Disappointing,"Constantly on the phone to Apple, but I still cannot get this to work properly. Since day one I have had an issue where it doesn’t show up properly in the Home app & I therefore cannot change any settings or use all its features. This is a known issue & I am simply told (by Apple) to wait for an update later this year. It has been over 6 months now. I wish I had returned it when I could."
5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,A great whole house experience,"We have 5 of these strategically placed throughout the house. Control your stuff, play your music, fill the house with birds or crickets sounds for relaxing atmosphere. As for funny sounds to mess with your kids or dogs. Amazing sound at a great value."
3.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Great Sound but Needs Work,"I loved my Homepod so much I bought this second one so I could listen in stereo, however it will not play both speakers when I stream via airplay. Apple needs to fix this problem ASAP. Therefore if you stream your music from your computer's itunes don't buy two for stereo. It doesn 't work."
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,HomePod is awesome!,HomePod is the best. It is loud! The sound quality is great throughout the entire volume range. It is also nice not having to carry my iPhone around the house to talk to Siri. Best Father’s Day present!
1.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Returned it.,"Was super excited to try the HomePod but after researching, discovered that HomeKit doesn’t work with half of our smart electronics at home. Seemed pointless outside of the incredible sound everyone raves about. Not to mention the price is way too high for a smart speaker that doesn’t work for whole home audio setups."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Awesome,Love HomePod. I have three and will get more. Used air play in the same room on Apple tv thru an $800 sony soundbar. The soundbar sounded like a tin box compared to HomePod. HomePod is excellent as a smart home device also. HomePods work great near each other too
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Well worth the money,Amazing sound from such a small speaker. I have owned everything from full tower speakers from Definitive Tech to Sonos and more. Sound quality is better than any smart speaker on the market. You are limited to Apple Music for voice control but I would prefer switching to gain superior sound rather staying with another music service for inferior sound quality. Quality build and materials. Super easy set up!!!!
4.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Great sound,"I have a Sonos 3 and now the HomePod. The HomePod quality of sound is even better than the Sonos, very impressed! Great for working out and can change the sound, or the song by talking rather than having to push any buttons."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Best smart speaker on the market.,"If you have invested in apple products, then this little but large speaker is the one for you. The sound is great for such a small speaker, and with the new update, you can do so much more. Love how I can tell it to unlock my doors, turn on lights, turn down the ac, and ect. Great product with a lot of potential."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Sound!,"I purchased this unit and it plays wonderful great sound as its compact size speaker. the down side is that I had end up returning it because I dont use much apple music as thats what this unit is compatible with, I wished they had made it work with other applications such as Spotify or etc......but overall a great sound unit."
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Great sound quality!,"Excellent home audio device. Will work seamlessly with all your other Apple products, and provides arguably the easiest setup for a home speaker. Definitely worth the purchase!"
1.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Horrible,"Sound is ok the problems are in the inconsistent connection to the internet , Siri doesn’t know anything and airplay from Mac to Apple TV results in a disconnection which means it doesn’t work MAC to Apple TV = no HomePod sound . Don’t waist your money it’s totaly agrivating to reconnect your speakers every time you turn on Apple TV"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Better than Sonos???,"In my opinion, YES. The sound quality in my own experience was way better than my Sono One with Alexa. I had both in same room and went back and forth and HomePod really was top notch. Not to mention that I believe Apple music is way better than Amazon. I just ordered my 5th one today and could not be happier!!"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great speaker for those in the Apple ecosystem,"The HomePod is a great sounding speaker. No question. Siri isn’t as useful as some of the other voice assistants, but if you’re in the Apple ecosystem, it has the best integration you can get."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Outstanding,"Holy Wow!! The Home Pod is such an Amazing Speaker. it is more than a premium Speaker it is in a class all of its own. The Clarity of the Sound even at High Volumes is perfect, no Distortion. this one Speaker almost puts my entire Bose Home Theatre System to Shame. Bravo Apple, another Great Product."
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Better than I expected,I had high hopes for the HomePod and they were exceeded. The responsiveness is excellent with great sound. I’m planning to purchase another for our basement so I can exercise without headphones.
5.0,8 months ago,ebay.com,Makes my old stereo sound very inferior. Im hearing instruments in well known songs Id not heard before,"Not cheap but hey, this level of sound quality!! If you can afford too buy a pair and set them up as stereo, you will be blown away."
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Amazing Sound Quality!!,"Such an amazing device with immense sound quality! Turning it on for the first time I was blown away and still am! Those saying Siri isn’t very good on it are wrong. It works flawlessly for everything I need it for - basic questions, playing music or controlling my HomeKit devices. Would highly recommend!"
4.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Sounds terrific,I now own two of these and have them paired for stereo listening. It was great sound with one but two together sounds outstanding. Siri however is definitely the dumb blonde in the home assistant battle
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Simply Awesome Sound!,“Say hello to my little friend!” I was seriously blown away that something this small could sound so good. I was leaning towards Alexa for it’s features but the sound quality was nothing close to this. The features are going to grow with future updates. I’m satisfied with my purchase that’s for sure!
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Awesome theater or stereo compliment,I had been reading and researching this product since it was released. It compliments my AppleTV. Sound and quality construction is unrivaled. I wish they would have added Bluetooth capabilities along with AirPlay. I am still learning how to operate them properly.
1.0,a month ago,bestbuy.ca,Refurb lasted only a year,"I purchased a refurbished model here and it only lasted a year. Now it's a $400 paper weight. Apple won't even help me, what a horrible waste of money!!!!!! I will never trust refurbished products from here ever again!!!!!!!"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Home Pod,"The HomePod is great if you’re and apple customer and if you also have WiFi. It does not work via Bluetooth and if you don’t have Apple Music your options are also very limited. If you fill the 3 requirements thought, you will love this speaker. The quality is decent, and it is also a lot of fun playing with your musi and Siri!"
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Amazing sound!,Easy to set up and amazing sound! Able to play all my music from my favorite streaming apps. Siri is also helpful and easy to use. Even my 4yr old love to ask Siri to play KIDZ Bop songs.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Fantastic Speaker,"The HomePod brings functionality as a home assistant in a fantastic speaker with excellent sound quality. The handshake with other Apple devices works seamlessly as well. If you are at all invested in Apple’s universe of products, you will not be disappointed!"
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Not quite there.,"Mac user since 1990. This has to be the first product of Apple that lags behind its competitors. Siri is frustrating, and quite honest the sound -which is supposed to be its big advantage- is not an improvement over what it replaced (a JAM Symphony ). A big disappointment that was returned."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Amazing,"Great speakers to have if you are all things apple. Syncs up great with MacBook, apple tv, and iPhone. I bought 2 when they were on sale and they have added a new experience to watching movies with my setup."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Works exactly as advertised,"If you buy it to use as a good sounding speaker you will be very happy. Siri is Siri, but she hears you incredibly well even over music. Pair a second one with it for stereo sound and it is incredible. My only gripe is that I ordered Space Gray and received White. It worked out so I'm not going to cause a stink about it."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Works well,"This is a product it is obviously design for someone that is using the Apple Music service. I have used it for multiple conference calls in the responses been very good, people seem to think that it’s very clear. You can either initiate the call from the speaker assuming that the contact is in your phone, and it uses the phone to make the call Or you can start the call on your phone and then transfer the audio over to the speaker."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Decent product, great with Apple Music",This product is decent; the sound quality is okay compared to my $2000+ speaker. But using Siri and Apple Music on this thing is easy and really convenient. I'd recommend this to anyone who is only going to spend under $500 for a decent speaker and uses Apple Music.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Device for the Apple Ecosystem,"I already owned a google home mini which stays in the kitchen but I knew that when this came out I was going to get it. Siri is not the best assistant by far, but the one I use. The sound quality is amazing and setting up stereo pairing was very fast. I love this speaker!"
1.0,a year ago,Best Buy,wait for the next version,Wait for next version of the HomePod Does sound good but not better than my Bose Revolve plus! So to actually use this it’s is gonna cost you $120 a year To play music that you already have on iTunes you have to Use the app (ridiculous) Homepod should have Bluetooth I hear no difference in the quality of sound with AirPlay This is one of the few products that I ever took back Made by apple Been a Mac user since 1997
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Great value,"B&H discounted the HomePod by $100 before Xmas. Great speaker, outstanding sound from such a small device. Far and away the best sound of all the smart speakers. Have 6 of them in three separate rooms. Getting rid of all my old audio equipment and speakers."
5.0,2 months ago,bhphotovideo.com,Great purchase,"The sound from this unit is so good that I bought a second unit to make it stereo. Set up is simple. The only puzzling issue is I am not sure what what the source the speaker is playing. (phone, computer or Apple TV )"
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,HomePod Devliers,"I have the Bose Resolve+ and initially thought that HomePod wouldn't be as good. While the Bose is great, HomePod is next level. The HomePod doesn't distort at high volume, is incredibly clear, Siri can hear you over the music from across the room, and the BASS is amazing! I love bass and know that sometimes bass compromises quality, however this is not the case for HomePod. For those who want the best audio quality first and smart features second, this is the speaker for you!"
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Siri is STOOPID,"Just so you know... Siri here, on the Homepad was, is and remains crazy stupid. Can't do much - I waited for firmware upgrades and fixes but not one additional benefit since day one. I barely use the thing. I tell her to add things to my grocery list that she always screws up and then when I'm in the store I'm like ""what the heck is this?"". Oh, music you ask? Eh."
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Perfect Pair!!!,I purchased the HomePod to pair with my AppleTV to give my bedroom a surround sound effect w/o the bulky equipment. Bonus!!! Also became a white noise speaker for my 7 mo old. He’s out in 3 minutes tops.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,LOVE HOMEPOD,"I was hesitant to get the HomePod at launch, but when it went on sale I jumped on it. I love it. It sounds amazing and Siri hears you well. Having Phillips Hue and Apple Music makes the experience however. If you do not own smart accessories or have an Apple Music Subscription I would avoid."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Boom Boom,"I am impressed with the sound from this speaker. I wish the volume could just a tad louder because I like my music loud, but it has a nice sound and deep bass sound. I purchased two. Even though both are not in the same room as recommended for pairing, I can pair both for surround sound (one is in the living room and one is in the bedroom)."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Product for Apple Devotees,"Setup is super easy on a new unit; not sure about open box items. Great sound will please almost any audiophile. Not cheap, but which Apple products are? Other Siri features still could be improved, but you can’t beat the sound in a unit of this size."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,As good as advertised!,"Sound from this is incredible! So easy to use, my 4 year old no says, ""Hey Siri, play Frozen music!"" Although not as cheap as amazon products, the sound from this is unbeatable! So glad I finally purchased it."
5.0,2 years ago,John Lewis,HomePod,I purchased the HomePod as a speaker first and foremost and it doesn’t disappoint! Im really impressed by the sound and not just for a speaker of its size. I’ve used more ‘smart’ features than I expected and I’m sure more options will be integrated with future updates. I have an Apple Music subscription which helps but you can also airplay direct from a compatible device. As with most Apple products it looks fantastic and feels high quality too.
4.0,a year ago,Argos,It’s good but .....,The HomePod was good but Apple need to do a lot more work on improving the sound quality and needs to be louder !! Siri is sadly a massive fail compared to the others But for me ... Sonos still leads the way in this game by a long shot in absolutely everything Maybe in 6 months time when Apple improves Siri and sound it’ll be well worth the price tag it’s asking ?
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Great sound, stupid Siri","Homepod is good for the sound. So if you are buying because you care about the sound more than anything else, then homepod is great for you. If you want a smart AI, then look somewhere else really. Siri is not that functional. I bought it because i care about sound more than AI"
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Great Sound!!,HomePod was easy to set up and the sound is incredible. Bought the HomePod to automate my home and it just makes it much easier. No scrambling for my phone to turn things on or off. “Hey Siri“ makes it a breeze.
5.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Apple Homepod,"I wanted something that could play all my digital music, as well as the internet radio. This fits the bill perfectly. Linked with Apple Music I can play anything that is available, plus any of the internet radio stations because of the appleplay link. Overall, a good product."
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Buy two for best sound experience,I bought one and sounded pretty decent however when connecting two it’s a complete and total difference in experience. They sound amazing! No joke. I bought them when they were 199
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great sound,"Although this is the first iteration for Apple, this speaker sounds awesome. Like all smart speakers, there’s room for improvement but I have yet to run into any major problems using Siri with HomePod. I’m looking into getting a second. If you are a part of the Apple ecosystem, this is the speaker for you."
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Speaker,"This is a great speaker. However, I found that the interface with my iPhone and iPad was spotty. Also, the fact that it does not do bluetooth is a real drawback. The sound quality of the HomePod is excellent. Because its interface is spotty, I chose ""not"" for recommending to a friend."
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Amazing Sound and accessibility,"This speaker sounds great and connects flawless with Apple HomePod kit. However, I don’t recommend for college dorms because it really doesn’t connect to university WiFi well."
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Apple HomePod,"You won't be disappointed with the Apple HomePod! The speaker is a great addition to any room. We have several other non-Apple speakers, but the Apple is the best for sound in high ceiling rooms."
5.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Obsessed,"Got this for my fiancé and i because we’re obsessed with unnecessary things lol and to our surprise it’s actually very helpful. i listen to podcasts/music while i cook & this is awesome to speak to and change, rewind, skip or fast forward without getting screens dirty. love it"
5.0,a year ago,harveynorman.com.au,Perfect if you’re within the Apple ecosystem,Perfect if you are within the Apple ecosystem. The sound quality is outstanding. Siri is not on the same level as Google but this could be improved with a software update. If you’re an Android user or use Google home or Alexa I would recommend the Sonos One.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Best Speakers for Apple Fans,"I bought two of these, and let me tell you, in stereo configuration they are absolutely incredible. I was amazed by one: I stood next to it and admired the quality and volume, and then stood 15' away, and it sounded as if it was the same volume and quality--unbelievable. I bought a second one the next day and couldn't be happier!"
5.0,7 months ago,ebay.com,Sounds great & home automation is cool.,Used Homepod in perfect shape as described. Had some initial problems that surfaced which software updates and/or removing Homepod & adding back resolved. Sounds great!
3.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,"Good sound, mine talked randomly",The sound was good. The Siri works well in the Apple ecosystem. Mine was a little weird. It spoke slot unprompted. Ended up returning it but I might buy another and try again
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great solution for my bedroom/office,Was looking for an Airplay speaker for my bedroom and office. Opted for the HomePod over the Sonos One due to the review about sound output and clarity. In my lofted bed/office space this can produce enough sound to fill my apartment with a high degree of clarity.
4.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Nice but limited speaker,A mixed bag. Loved the way it works with Apple Music. I decided to stick with my Sonos One’s and sub. I believe the clarity of the Sonos One’s for music is better than the HomePod.
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Nice Speaker!,"Bought HomePod today. Wow! Sound quality is superb! Louder than I expected. Very nice integration with phone and easy to set up. I like how I can access it from the control center and in music to play my music from library. Using Echo Dot, I had to open the Alexa app. Answers all my questions like my phone does except it can’t access my calendar and it can’t make calls or emails. I would recomend to anyone with an iPhone."
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Love it,"Added another pod the home and it sounds good and dose what I need it to do. Good sound minor things like timers, music control, and can play anything from my iPhone or iPad to the speakers, nothing fancy just good sound."
2.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Not A Fan,"While this is a nice little speaker for your desk at home or for a dorm, it does not get very loud at all. As an Apple Fan Boy for basically my whole life, they missed the mark. It is difficult to get set up in other places if you decide to take it somewhere else."
4.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,A speaker that does other tasks,This is a great sounding speaker. It’s like other smart speakers but really shines in the Apple system. Setting up is a matter of bringing your phone or iPad next to it.
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Apple Home Pod A+++,The Apple Home pod is very easy to use. I got my first one for Christmas and since have asked for a second one for my birthday. Great sound and easy to use voice command allow me to play my music right from my itunes library.
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Great Sounding Speaker,I bought this speaker to use as a speaker in my bedroom for tv and music. Setup was easy and the sound is fantastic. I simply speak to have Siri play the news in the morning and the same with music.
4.0,a year ago,Target,Great sounding home smart speaker,Wonderful sound. Looks terrific. Works great with Apple Music. It will be nicer when Apple adds some more functionality. Love how well it hears commends even with fairly loud audio playing.
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Great sound,I love my new Homepod that I got for my birthday. It has a great sound and it’s loud and Siri works great with Apply Music and it’s so easy asking Siri to play a song or an artist. You can control the volume by touching the buttons or asking Siri to do it for you.
3.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Sounds great,"The sound quality is great, but it is NOT compatible with any of the third party music company (ie: Pandora, Spotify, etc.). To maximize the features from the HomePod you have to have Apple Music subscription to have it working through Siri."
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,"Great sound, a little expensive","The Apple HomePod has great sound quality, and works very well with my Apple products. It has tremendous voice recognition. It is very expensive, but we were able to get a deal on it during Black Friday shopping."
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Great Sound,Fantastic sound quality for small smart speaker. Siri homekit integration is great. Changed all of my light switches to Lutron Caseta Wireless switches and now can control all of my lights with simple Siri commands. BIG plus.
2.0,2 years ago,John Lewis,Disappointed,"I have apple products so decided to purchase the HomePod instead of Sonos, what a mistake! The speaker looks great, but the bass is so overpowering if you place the speaker next to other objects, even with adjusting the equaliser through Apple Music, it was awful and not useable. The speaker has to be placed in an open space to work, which in every day life is not always possible. The HomePod was returned, it is overpriced and over hyped, I’ll be buying Sonos speakers."
5.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,"Great speaker, just what I needed",I have heard that it doesn’t do as much as other brands as far as directing it to do things but perfect for what I wanted. No complaints. It does have a higher price point but if sound is important to you than it is way better then Alexa.
4.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Works as expected and product is good!,"All around the HomePod is as good as the tech reviews say it is. Sound quality is great (I've actually purchased 2) but the lack delivery on AirPlay 2 for multiroom streaming is a challenge. Additionally, some level of integration with AppleTV is expected but not delivered at this time. Always room for improvement but great start!"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Super,"I love music and this HomePod delivers. It sounds noticeably better than my Bose or Sonos. Siri works just great even when the music is loud. It has some limitation but if you don't know them without me telling you, you probably wouldn't miss them anyway. My my purpose is music for this speaker and its amazing ."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Another Hit from Apple,"Have the convenience of home hub and great TV sound ( dont need sound bar). Set up was so easy, anyone should be able to do it from their iPhone or TV screen using Apple TV device"
5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,"Great sound, good product!","Great sound! I read many reviews before buying this speaker. It is everything they said and more. It produces beautiful hi fidelity sound and siri works just fine! I recommend this Apple product to anyone who enjoys good, quality sound!"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Sounds amazing,"It is nit flimsily built unlike the 30$ smart speakers from amazon and google. Sounds very crisp. The thumpy bass is of audiophile quality, I control my home lights and multi room with it and it catches my commands even in a lot of ambient noise . Well done apple"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Awesome sound,"Awesome sound for a small speaker. The ability to talk to Siri over any music is awesome. Compared to the google home, this was more expensive, but worth every additional penny. Playing TV sound via AppleTV eliminated the need for a sound bar. It’s awesome."
5.0,7 months ago,ebay.com,Home pod in stereo,One home pod is great add a second joined in stereo to the 1st and your on another planet. I dont listen to my own music now I ask Siri to find new things / genres and then the quality of play back is further enhanced Best product I have purchased in along time.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,I love it!,Got it on a sale for $50 less. I’m fully invested in Apple HomeKit and this helps control everything. My kids use it more than me for the music capability but I like it as a hub for my smart devices. The sound is very good. I just wish it was cordless. Siri picks up on everything even while the music is playing!
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Speaker & more!,"The Apple HomePod is fantastic! It plays whatever I want, when I want it - and the sound is fabulous! Of course, it also answers my various historic and encyclopedic questions, puts appointments in my calendar and much, much more. I highly recommend the Apple HomePod."
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Good but not great,"The sound from the HomePod is good....I just wish it was great. Yes, it is better than the Amazon device but 3 times the price. If you plan to use this as a hub for your smart home...you cannot set it to play music for an automated scene. Recently, Siri appears to be slowing down as well. Apple has a lot of work to do to catch up with Alexus."
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Apple Home Pod,Apple Home Pod is overall awesome in everything you want it to do. All you need is great WiFi in your home and your set. Excellent playlists that study my music on my phone and does everything Siri does. I love it!!!!!
5.0,a week ago,ebay.com,Great speaker and complement to your Apple Ecosystem.,HomePod is a beautiful speaker with astonishing audio quality and magic features that pair beautifully with other Apple products. Simple and easy to use. Very recommended.
5.0,11 months ago,bhphotovideo.com,Great for Apple homes and offices,"I have a pair each in my home and office. Both are all Apple,and setting them up was seamless and easy. Sound is terrific, though not as great as my JBL-100’s I had in college. Then again nothing is as good as those."
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Awesome,Deep bass and crystal clear sound! Who wants a speaker to order junk from Amazon? I want a speaker that sounds good and thanks to B&H at a great price. I would definitely choose this speaker over inferior options from Amazon and Google or even Sonos. Siri is right on in understanding whose music I want to hear.
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Apple Loyalist,"It's no Alexa, but I'm hoping with future updates, it'll be more in tune with accessing internet so answer questions asked, like ""hey Siri, What is...."" for example. Also have to remind yourself to always say "" 'HEY' Siri"". Other than that, great sound! I keep it in the kitchen so I always have music, news and a timer."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Perfect for apple integrated household,"I love listening to music. The sound quality of this HomePod is excellent. If you have an Apple Music subscription, this is a perfect compliment."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Sounding Speaker,"Apple's HomePod is probably not as versatile as Amazon's Alexa in terms of what it can do, but if your primary reason for buying a speaker is to listen to music, HomePod's sound is superior. Apple is increasing the list of things Siri can do for you through HomePod, and it's superior sound for music makes it right for me. I have two, and plan to add a third."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great sound !,"I waited to buy this HomePod because I just wasn’t sure even tho I’m a total Apple junkie!!!! I got it 100$ off and the sound quality is awesome. Very easy to set up. Glad I bought it! Doesn’t do as much as amazon echo, but I’m sure in time it will be very competitive, with sound quality way superior."
4.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Nice Speaker,"The Apple HomePod is a nice speaker with quality sound. However, if I could go back, I would have purchased the Bose Home Speaker 500 because of the features and its compatibility with non-Apple devices."
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Love it!!!,This is my second HomePod and I couldn’t be happier. I use them as my stereo sound in my bedroom and it gives a great immersive experience for the cost. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good sounding smart speaker.
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Great Smart Speaket,"The HomePod has great sound, and if you have Apple Music, its a no brainer. I seem to have better luck with Siri than many. The HomePod handles smart home commands quicker and more consistently than the Amazon dot"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Easy setup - Beautiful Product from Apple,"Very easy to setup, had to update IOS but thats normal. Classy product Workhorse with 8 speakers and 6 microphones. Beautiful sound quality!"
5.0,a month ago,John Lewis,Great HomeKit and Siri speaker,"This is a fantastic speaker (even better when two are paired for stereo) with HomeKit, AirPlay 2 and Siri functionality. An absolute must for anyone who’s in the Apple ecosystem."
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Bought to pair with another,"Pairing with my first HomePod was easy. Can quickly unpair to take outside and repair it with the other when brought back in. Also use it to control my lights, air conditioning/furnace and Lutron shades."
1.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Don’t Buy!!,"The HomePodOS is extremely buggy. The HomePod barely works as it’s supposed to. Audio quality is amazing but it’s not worth your frustration. I’ve had way too many issues with the HomePod, as well as others."
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Awesome,"I bought this product because I heard it could connect with my Apple TV. Once I got it connected (which wasn’t hard, go to settings audio and video) it gave sound to go along with my sound bar. Along with having Siri, it’s a win, win."
2.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Siri is still dumb,I returned for 2 main reasons. Siri is still stupid compared to Google. And to obtain stereo sounds you’ll need 2 HomePod. Apple needs to drop the price to make that happened.
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"good sound quality, bad smart features","Got this speaker when it was on sale. The sound quality is better than all of its competitors including Amazon Echo and Google Home. However, it falls short on the Siri part: bad voice recognition, cannot search the web, and limited music streaming services."
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Not as smart as other smart speakers,"I bought this and returned after a few days. It is a great sounding speaker. It is great if you use Apple Music, I do not. I have other smart speakers that sound pretty good for less money. Siri needs work still."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Audio king,"This is my third HomePod and with this one, I created a stereo setup with Apple’s AirPlay 2 feature. HomePod sounds incredible playing any music and the left and right speakers now give a much better television sound effect. I stream everything so this setup is perfect for me."
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Amazing sound ... can't wait for stereo functinality,"These sound stunning – deep, rich bass, and highs and mid-tones that are undistorted even at top volume. I can't wait until stereo functionality is enabled so that all three of my HomePods can work in harmony. Airplay2 is going to be a game changer!"
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Great booming sound !,I purchased this on sale ($100 off) so my normal disclaimer of the apple tax does not apply here ! The sound quality is great. Some may find the bass to be a little bit too much. I however love it.
5.0,3 weeks ago,Best Buy,Quality over Function,"Great speaker and design is excellent but the purchase is for the sound and not the integrations. It definitely lacks integration with other services, but when you use this for sound alone it is worth the price."
1.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Terrible speaker,"$300 for what ? I wasn't even told it wasn't wireless, you can't even tell its plugged in at the store, doesn't even work under certain wifi, barely does anything, & I have definitely heard way louder speakers, so disappointed in this product."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great sound!,Set up was quick and easy. Tie in to phone and smart devises easy as well. Music sounds great on it. Siri responds well to questions or controlling smart devices.
4.0,a month ago,Currys,Robert's review of Apple HomePod,Pros: Bass at low level volumes is very impressive for such a small unit. Cons: Don’t seem to be able to adjust EQ on device sending music to HomePod. I’d like to boost treble.
5.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Brilliant!,"This is a great sounding speaker and Siri makes a decent voice assistant, whos software will only improve over time. The HomePod projects a high quality, strong sound from all directions and has powerful microphones which hear you even when the speaker is playing at full volume. I can’t wait to buy another!"
2.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,No Compatibility = Deal Breaker,"There is 0 compatibility with third party music services like pandora/google play/spotify. Both the google home systems and Amazon Echo's have this, plus better assistants. For $350 this thing is a joke, it was great sound quality but Siri is horrible at processing commands and needs a ton of work. Maybe next year this thing will be worth it but right now you can deck out your whole home with google or amazon for the same price as one of these."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Amazing speaker for the Apple ecosystem,"Siri shines her way through within HomePod. The sound blazes throughout the room in every direction and with the new iOS 11.4 update, AirPlay 2 lets me listen to my movies and shows both on my tv and HomePod for a more surround sound-like experience. HomePod is worth it. Get it."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great sound,"This is great sound in a small package. It’s easy to set up with your iPhone. Siri could use some improvements, but works well enough. If you buy two homepods, you can set them up as left and right stereo speakers, and the soundstage is really expanded."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Better than Alexa!,"Great product and build. However, while it’s better than any of its competitors, it doesn’t give the volume of sound like the $400 JBL Bluetooth speaker. If you are looking for good sounding music AND you want to connect with other products, this is a great buy."
5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Awesome device,"Better than I thought it was going to be and sound. Setup is so simple its crazy. Great value if purchased for under $300, normal retail of 349 is too expensive even for such a high quality product. Would purchase again. Shipped and delivered a day earlier than expected also."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,I love it.,"Siri can hear you from across the ocean with 20 elephants trumpeting right beside it. That might be an exaggeration, but that’s what it feels like. I was surprised by the sound quality. I wouldn’t trade your car stereo for them, but for a large sized living room it is more than exceptional."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Love the Rich Sound,I bought a HomePod for my home office and use it everyday. The sound is fantastic and having Apple Music behind it gives me the best quality streaming music and the HomePod makes it sound as good as it can get. I ended up buying three more HomePods - one for my living room and two as gifts. I love the HomePod.
5.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Just what you expect from Apple,"The HomePod is a high quality item, the sound quality is exceptional, the ""Smart"" part is not as advanced as others, but it will improve with software updates. We have 3 of these and use MAC's, iPhones & Apple TV's all of which interact well with the HomePod, we also use it for controlling our Tado central heating controls via HomeKit."
4.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Love the sound quality,"I love the sound quality and convenience of no wires, apart from the power cord. I’ve taken advantage of the Apple Music free trial and love being able to choose what to hear from more than just my own music collection/library. Siri is a bonus, in my opinion, as I was more interested in the sound quality."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Very capable device, great sound!",Sounds AMAZING. Fills the large space where I have it very well. Coupled with an Apple Music Subscription it was a great give for my wife's parents who are a bit older. They love the ability to call up any song they'd like to hear in English or Spanish.
4.0,5 months ago,bhphotovideo.com,Great Product,"I love this product, the sound quality is amazing Missing better integration with apps such as Spotify and also missing more languages for siri. iPhone supports way more languages than the homepod which in my case was a bit misleading."
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,No Regrets,"The clarity of the sound are awesome, the best to yet to have hear and I have hear them all. A little tedious to use in the beginning, but Ill overcome that, like I have on many tech issue. I will pick up a second one. With or without iTunes or iPod or any Apple product this product will not be a No Regrets."
5.0,6 months ago,ebay.com,Apple HomePod,Amazing sound Ive paired it with another HomePod for true stereo sound and love the sound quality so much better when listening to the music has it was performed instruments and vocals swapping from left and right speakers takes me back to when playing my old vinyl collection
3.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Great product but.,"I’m an Apple fan and these are great sounding speakers very responsive to request, but that being said they need voice recognition and able to support more than one user. I’ve had a few times when audible said hey seriously Siri took it as a command."
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Sound does not disappoint. Siri does.,"Great speaker, airplay 2 is nice if for gatherings. Can have something playing through different parts of the house. Siri can be a let down at times."
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great sound,"I currently have the Bose sound touch 300 sounder and sub for my tv and able to stream iheartradio, pandora, and my library. I will agree that the sound from the HomePod is great, has deep bass and crisp however its missing on being able to stream from 3rd party. You can currently only listen to your music library from iTunes or beats1 if you don't have Apple Music subscription and this was a slight deal breaker for me."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,I love my HomePod!!,I bought this at a great price for Black Friday. I love the HomePod! I use it everyday. Very easy to setup and connect to other items around the house. It sounds amazing.
3.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Sounds is great. Siri is as smart as a 1 year old,Definitely the worst “smart” speaker. Probably the best speaker. No Spotify. No Bluetooth.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Worthy Competitor, Must have if you use HomeKit","The speaker sounds amazing, but I still find myself using my Sonos out of habit. Since HomeKit beats Alexa for my automation needs - the HomePod is a necessity to control these accessories. Siri literally will hear a whisper versus screaming at Alexa."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Honest Apple Geek Review,"I am a Huge Apple Geek...we own every Apple product and most entire product lines (every version of the iPad) etc. The HomePod can be used as a HomeKit hub, a great Apple Music DJ, a great speaker for it's size/class. Setup was very quick and the same setup as AirPods. We have 2 HomePods and look forward to AirPlay2!"
5.0,3 months ago,ao.com,Just love this Apple HomePod. The sound is crystal clear. A good thing about this is when you ask it to do something you don’t have to shout at it a normal talking voice will suffice. I can not recommend this highly enough.,Just love this Apple HomePod. The sound is crystal clear. A good thing about this is when you ask it to do something you don’t have to shout at it a normal talking voice will suffice. I can not recommend this highly enough.
5.0,a year ago,John Lewis,A wonderful item for home entertainment,What a wonderful piece of technology the Apple Home Pod is. My grandchildren really love it as much as I do and I find it amazing that it can find virtually any song or piece of music that you ask of it. You can even ask it to play you a selection of the group or artist of your choice. I think every home should have one.
4.0,2 years ago,Currys,Lee's review of Apple HomePod,"Pros: Well made, sounds good, loud, links to iTunes. Being Apple should be future prood. Good weight Cons: No display . Can only be paired with another HomePod for stereo playback. I would like to see a omega unit that is just the speaker part for less money"
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,My second one!,"I adored my first Homepod since 2018’s launch. I didn’t care for Homekit or Siri being an Alexa competitor. All I wanted was the sound quality. I got it the first time, and now in stereo I’m extremely satisfied."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great product,"Like all Apple products, the HomePod is sleek and of great quality. Excellent sound and I like that it has a long cord for easy placement in various spots. There are a couple things I wish Siri would do, like adjust the bass, but it’s possible I just haven’t quite figured out how yet."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Exceptional Sound,"This is one of the best sounding speakers around that will give you the clarity and bass many desire in such a small package. As Apple improves Siri, the HomePod will even be unmatched."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Awesome Sound & Easy to Use,We love the Apple Home Pod is a wonderful addition to our home. The kids from 2 year old to 11 year old and adults like to take turns telling Siri what music to play. Even the toddlers can tell her to play their favorite songs. Biggest issues we have is everyone remembering to take turns.
3.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Buggy,"I have two homepods linked and they on occasion disconnect, one plays the other doesn’t. Siri is hit and miss. Sometimes she works sometimes she doesn’t. They are not cheap and are frustrating."
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Worth it,"The ease of setup is astounding. I think the price might be a bit much (we bought it on sale on B&H), but I have a feeling we will be paying full price for another one. The quality is high, and the sound is very pleasant: from classical to classic rock to rap to k-pop this little speaker is amazing. It fills a room very well for its size."
5.0,2 months ago,ebay.com,Excellent sound quality and Siri connection,The sound is amazing from any room in the house. I love the Siri aspect. It plays practically any kind of music I ask it to. I wasn't expecting that.
2.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Cool speaker, nothing else","I purchased the HomePod on sale (-100) for a more impressive speaker in my office, as well as a better “speaker phone.” Siri is basically useless beyond the two reasons I purchased this thing. Pros: compact design and sounds great. Cons: too many to list..."
4.0,4 weeks ago,Best Buy,Great quality sound HomePod,My wife and love this HomePod. We have it in the kitchen and the sound quality is great! We are Apple users so this works out better for us then the google home and amazon dot.
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Good sound and comfort but,","Audio lag is a deal breaker as I watch a lot of YouTube. Netflix and Amazon prime video sync well. Battery life is very good. Build quality, comfort and sound are excellent. Would recommend them to a friend with caveat regarding audio lag."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Elder Geek,"Liked the Apple Home Pod so much I bought two, it's nice to just say hey Siri play any song or songs by an artist you like and its done. I have iPhone X. Apple Watch and I mac can use all devices to play and control music. I also use Home Pod to control Phillips smart lights in my house. Home Pod works Great and Sounds really good."
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Not Worth the Money,If you are looking for a premium speaker for your home and dont already have a Bluetooth or other speaker system JUST for music then this is 100% what you want. However as always Apple is late to the game.... if the HomePod has a screen like the google Home stuff does now it would be my fav and 10 stars. however for 350 or more its not really worth it.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Sounding Speaker,"This is a great sounding speaker. It is a perfect addition to a family with other Apple Products. It is not as ""smart"" as some of the competition but it I prefer it hands down to anything else on the market. The sound is unmatched and it works great in the Apple ecosystem."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Awesome,I bought a bunch for gifts for some over achieving students. Had to return two that arrived with a plastic wrap. My kids are loving it. The parents came back with feedback that the children play songs on this speaker and the sound is exceptional. Very pleased with this choice.
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Sound but Expensive,"HomePod gives a great sound and interacts with Siri and the whole Apple Universe so very well. However, you cannot hook up anything else using Bluetooth to this speaker. Also, at $349 it’s expensive. If your an Apple person living in the Apple Universe its just great!"
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,"It is awesome, my kids love it.",It is so cool for my four year old granddaughter to play a song by giving a loud command on the song she wants to hear. My older daughter loves to here her music and enjoys it more than anyone else. Great gadget for all ages.
5.0,2 years ago,Argos,Great Design even down to the power cord.,"Apple have again waited for the others then come out with a really great product, sounds great. Siri control. Works with Spotify. But really comes into its own with Apple Music., also will only work with Apple products Iphone iPad Shame no Bluetooth connection for Android."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Love My HomePod,"I love this speaker. The sound is great. “Hey Siri” works wonderfully. Please be aware that this speaker only works with Apple Music or music that’s in your iTunes library and you must have WiFi. You cannot use Pandora, Spotify or any other music service."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Simply perfect,Incredible sound for its size. Very easy to use. Best speaker I got so far (and I also have bang and Olufsen products) Only issue : having a Apple Music subscription is mandatory if you want to use the voice recognition.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,This speaker Rocks !,"Wow is all I can say. I can feel the music on the surface of my desk at work. Very enjoyable even at low volumes but it will rock out at higher volumes. I have Bose SoundTouch 10 and 20, JBL extreme neither of which can vibrate the surface or give 360 degrees of sound from any angle. Worth every penny!"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Sounds Better than a Google Home Max,"I bough both a Homepod and a Google Max and the clear winner in Homepod. The sound quality is amazing and if you already own an iphone and apple tv then this is a no think buy. Google Home Max does offer better smart home compatibility, quirks, and triva."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Love!,"Amazing sound and sleek looking. Snagged two during the lower price for Black Friday. Extremely happy we did! Listen with tv, music, phone calls, and smart light to mention a few."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Great sound, easy setup",I chose the HomePod over other devices because of the excellent sound and ease of use.

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Excellent sounding speaker,This speaker sounds amazing & I love the built in Siri functionality. Siri might not be as “smart” as Alexa or google home but for my purposes of playing music & basic questions or commands she works perfectly. I can’t wait to start getting HomeKit enabled smart devices to connect to my HomePod.
5.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Great sound,The sound that come out of these is incredible. I was blown away. I wish Siri was a little more helpful but we bought it for the sound quality. Works great with our phones and Apple TVs too.

Well worth the money and would recommend to anyone with an iPhone or iPad.

I do use the voice commands a lot, and they do work great, but I've used the Alexa and her commands are broader and more nuanced. That said, the HomePod is out of the box amazing sound!!! I haven't stopped listening since the day it arrived."

5.0,a year ago,Argos,HomePod sound quality best smartspeaker,When it comes to sound quality- one homepod sounds amazing- two homepods are sublime. Set up is unbelievably simple- but you do need to be an apple household with apple music to get the most from this amazing music centre. Highly recommended for apple fans.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Sound quailty is amazing,Put this in my bedroom and the sound quailty sounds so amazing it sounds way be then all those echos speakers from amazon... the only thing i wish it had that amazon echo has better is smart home feature..

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,A great speaker,"The Homepod May be a half-baked Apple product, but it sounds great. If you’re already in the Apple ecosystem, you can’t go wrong with this thing. Siri is lagging behind compared to Alexa and Google Assistant, but it is more responsive when it comes to smart devices and should only get better over time."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Incredible sound and responsiveness.,"If you're in the Mac universe, this is the only one to buy. The sound is very impresive, the responsiveness of Siri is a quantum leap better than the past versions and the ease of set up is remarkable."

4.0,5 months ago,ebay.com,Good sound quality and easy setup,Everything about this speaker is good except that it's not really a true Bluetooth speaker in the sense that you can't just pair it with any bluetooth device and expect it to work as an external Bluetooth speaker.
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Amazing speaker,"Very easy set up, fantastic sound. If not in the Apple Ecosystem then don’t bother with it. When Airplay2 comes sometime this year we will see he ability pair up speakers. Fully recommend this product which is well built and packs some amazing technology into it."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,HomePod is worth it,"I got this on a little sale, but wish I would have bought it earlier. I use it everyday to blast music for breakfast, parties, working out at home or so many other things. It works so great and looks so good."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,My son loves it!,Got this as one of my son's gifts for Christmas. He needed a good speaker and loves the functionality on the Homepod. He hasn't had much time to play around with it because we've been busy over the holidays but I will update this review with any pertinent info once he returns to college and has time to play around with it.
5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Very pleased,"I am very impressed with the HomePod, I have invested in Homekit, smart home components and use Apple Music as my prime source, so the HomePod integrates so well. Sound quality is fantastic. I couldnt be happier. Looking to put in a second one in the great room."
5.0,2 years ago,very.co.uk,Great item. Top quality. Recommend,"Quality of the device is unrivalled. Easy to setup, took literally minutes and is very simple to use. Sound quality is excellent. I won’t lie Siri has a couple of issues but with the update coming out these short comings I expect to be rectified. Highly recommend and works seamlessly with my Apple devices. Quickly delivery and great service."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Excellent Sound Quality. Lack Of Homekit Support,"The sound quality is really good. Its sound spectrum is full. But Apple still has to update their homekit app to support it better, especially with automation. For now, with homekit app, we can only turn it on/off or volumn up/down."
5.0,6 months ago,ebay.com,Amazing!,"The sound honestly blew me away. While its not as smart as other smart speakers, if youre setting up a ton of HomeKit devices, its quite a rather helpful hub. I will be buying a second one to dual up."
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,"Got it on the sale, and I’m VERY happy with it!","I waited to get the homepod even though I wanted one because $700 for 2 crossed a line somehow. (I paid $250 per homepod instead of the normal $350) But I bought two, and I love them. They sound good, Siri works extremely well (I have an Echo and a Google Home as well). Very happy with my purchase, if only they were $250 all the time!"
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Amazing Sound in a Small Package,We have a mix of smart speakers and this is the latest addition. It has amazing sound packed into a small device. It is also great to stream my iTunes content.
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Fun,Fun. I love that all I have to say is hey Siri in and she will play whatever song or playlist I ask. So easy. And always a crowd pleaser. Everyone wants to hear their favorite party song. Lol
4.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Quality Apple Siri/Sound system,"I found the sound quality to be very good. Sound is clear with good low end bass quality. Sounds good with one unit, very good with two linked together."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Love my homepod,"The sound quality on the HomePod is by far the best of any digital assistant out there. The HomePod doesn't have as many skills as it's competitors, but it can return basic information like weather, traffic, news, etc. It would be great if it would work natively with Spotify rather than forcing you to use Apple Music"
5.0,a year ago,abt.com,Great Sound,"After having an Alexa, we decide that sound quality and ease of use in the Apple environment was important. The sound is incredible. Now with AirPlay2, you can control individual HomePods and combine them for stereo sound. I might need to buy a second."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Outstanding!,The HomePod is phenomenal. I absolutely love this product. Siri and I have great one-sided conversations. :) I love music and love to rock out with all genres of music from blues to classical. I use the HomePod from sunrise to bedtime. Very happy I purchased this item.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Easy to use with Incredible Sound,The HomePod is simple to set up and sounds great! It has a very cool design and is a great addition to any home especially if you live in an Apple ecosystem already.
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Apple HomePod,"I got it for my wife for Christmas and she loves it! Too easy to set up, just plugged it in and it asked a couple of questions and it was done. We use it all the time and the sound is great! Thinking about getting another one for another room. Again the sound is great! Norrie J."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,HomePod Rocks!!!!,This little speaker packs a punch. Wow!!! I love it. If your Invested in Apple then this is a must have. Apple Music works perfectly on here with Siri. She plays everything I ask her too. Turns the volume down whatever I need. There’s not much too it. Remember you need Apple Music and you have too keep HomePod plugged in at all times. It’s not wireless. I find it better to be plugged in instead of charging on a battery for hours.
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Great sound and fun to use,These speakers sound so good. And I love talking to siri. I have even made phone calls with them. They are so convenient as well as being incredible speakers.
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Unbelievable Sound!,"Great sound with excellent base response for such a small package. Love having my iTunes library so easily accessible. I have Amazon Alexa and it excels over HomePod for a home personal assistant, but doesn’t even come close sound wise."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Amazing Sound,Have enjoyed owning the HomePod for about a year. Amazing quality sound. Works very well with iPhone to stream almost any audio. Highly recommended!
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,The sound is really attractive.,"If you listen to a song with a stereo configuration using Apple HomePod, you may feel as if you are listening to a song at a concert. Very well made Apple's home pot. It is recommended to buy all."
4.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,the apple eco system,"not. it is not as smart as Alexa. but it truly works great with apple ecosystem. if you got everything apple, this is the way to go. oh and the sound is fantastic!"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,This is awesome!,This is awesome. I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He loves it. It is so much better than our google mini. We can play our apple music through it and all kinds of other things.
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,If it’s great sound you want to hear....,Then this is a great buy! I was able to purchase it new for $250 where other competitors were selling it for $100 more. Siri has some catching up to do as far as what it can do or how it responds. When it comes to music and sound quality then I would give it a 5 start but overall 4 stars seems right.
2.0,2 years ago,very.co.uk,Not so good,"Expected great things from Apple and I have several other bluetooth speakers. Sound Quality was good, however volume was not very loud even at maximum. Even my Amazon Alexa plays louder. In addition the seven microphones don't work, you have to shout loud at it when music is playing to do anything, not as claimed. First apple product I have returned."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,This speaker is the best,"After researching all the other tech savvy speakers out there, this one is my favorite. Not only did I purchase one but I definitely went back and bought a second one for our home. It is very helpful with helping me keep up to the minute on news and even weather and also helps with hands off help.This beauty can read my text back to me and all."
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Great for quality sound,"Excellent sound. Very capable with music. Two paired in stereo is a very immersive experience. Siri via HomePod is not as good as others, which is well known."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Amazing Product,"At first we thought this might be more hype than substance, but after setting it up, it has amazing sound. Makes our other nodes obsolete. Best Buy had a terrific holiday deal on it, which prompted the purchase, and I have to say we are totally delighted with the product, and Best Buy for that matter."
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Simply excellent,"I bought this one on Black Friday. What a deal :) Of course, best sound quality among smart speakers. I thought Siri would be dumb, but she was quite smarter than I expected. Turning on the Hue light with Siri was faster than Alexa for me. I LOVE this."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Speaker,Great speaker... SIRI is limited but I'm sure with time Apple will improve this. Exceptionally easy to set up which is usually the case with Apple products. Four stars because SIRI needs work... but definitely the best sounding speaker out there!!!
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,GREAT Deal,I am very happy with the purchase of my HomePod from B&H! GREAT price for a great product. Item was carefully packaged to avoid damage and arrived before the expected delivery date. Shipped via FedEx with signature required to guard against the dreaded “porch pirate.” B&H has earned my business.
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great speaker,HomePod has great sound and is fun to use with the interactive voice assistant Siri. Only downfall is functionality as it doesn’t serve much of a purpose other than a speaker without other smart devices in the home. Best sounding smart speaker on the market.
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Sound is perfect,"Listened to this in store and was impressed by the sound. I bought it and placed it in my home and am extremely happy with how fantastic the music sounds, doesn't matter if you are in the same room or in the next room your ears will be happy! Only issue was some wifi connection as I tried to place it outside and the range is somewhat limited than other products."
4.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Great,This is a must for Apple Users especially with an Apple Music subscription as well. Your Android friends can't use it which is always a plus. The sound is fantastic and you will soon be wanting a second for your place.
5.0,3 months ago,John Lewis,"""I love it""","Purchased for our daughter. When asked what she thought of it, she replied, ""I love it. It always works. 'Hey Siri', have become the words that bring musical happiness"". Need I say more?"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Amazing speaker,"Great sound quality! The bass is really loud, which is exactly what I wanted. Siri works well and can hear you even when it’s loud around you. I don’t want to switch to Apple Music from Spotify, but if I did this product would be perfect."
4.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Easy music,"This was quite expensive but the sound was superior to the other brands. It can be a bit erratic and sometimes doesn’t respond and sometimes comes on, on its own, but I am still getting use to it. The beauty of this product is I can listen to any music without going through hundreds of CDs and its immediate."
4.0,a year ago,very.co.uk,Best sound,As a speaker this is an amazing device has the best sound with deep base and no distortion at the highest volume. The only let down is that Siri isn’t capable of doing much right now but I have no doubt that this is something that Apple will solve with an update in the near future. if you run an Apple system I recommend you get yourself one.
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,Best sounding speaker,Best sounding speaker I’ve ever owned. The sound quality fills the first floor of the house with ease and I am going to purchase a second one to put them together for a more immersive experience. I think the $349 price is worth every penny but especially discounted by B&H to $249 this is a steal!
4.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Beautiful Sound,It sounds great! Great Bass. Only issue is sometimes it disconnects from my WiFi. Possible due to my WiFi connection but I have had to unplug and plug it in 2x since I’ve bought it.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Easy to use and sounds amazing!,I jumped at the chance to purchase this at a recent sale and even splurged to get two and the sound quality rocks! And the functionality of having something like this in a HomeKit enabled home is invaluable.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Audio quality and Ease of Use,"I mostly use it as a Siri speaker to make my desk more hands free. Love it. It's not perfect but if you can work how apple wants you to, then it's perfect so... not for everyone. But if you have a bunch of apple devices, iOS, Apple TV, etc. It's a perfect addition."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Good but could be better,I had a sonos speaker before this but wanted to integrate into the apple system so I purchased this. Speaker sounds good but the capabilities of the speaker are limited you cannot call someone on it but you can answer a call. Maybe there will be a upgrade in the future but for now only gets 4 stars.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Amazing sound,The sound on this is incredible. I also use it to control my hue lights. I have both a echo dot and several google minis. HomePod’s voice recognition and ability to control my lighting system far exceeds both echo dot and the google mini.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,great addition to the others in place,this is the fourth installation and essentially is a simplistic whole house sound system. Lots of flexibility and overall good sound for the purpose intended.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Love to use it and no problem to set up,"I love the HomePod. I mainly use it to listen to my music collection, but also control Hue lights, get some news and also weather reports. I also have it connected to my Messages, Reminders, Grocery list, etc. No effort to set up with an iPhone, iPad or the latest iPod."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Small yet powerful,I always wanted to buy a homepod but it is so expensive. On black Friday there was a good deal. I finally decided to buy it. In fact that was the very last one on black friday that I picked up from the store in mountain view. I am very happy with it. The sound quality is just amazing.
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,I love it,"I don’t have a surround sound syste, the only audio from my tv is the tv speakers. The sound on this is amazing, the bass everything I love it. I haven’t tried the other features that much but if you are in my shoes, buy it. As for the smart speaker features, I hear it’s getting better."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,You think you don't need it until you get it,"I wasn't sure about buying a HomePod, I bought it because I need a hub for my HomeKit accessories. Once I installed it, I was amazed. the sound is better than any other speaker on my house. And it is very convenient to ask Siri to play music, set times, turn off lights, etc."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Absolute Best Bluetooth Speaker Out There!,"I love my HomePod! The ease of set up, the sound quality, and oh my goodness the bass! Great product by Apple. I use mine every day."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Apple HomePod is a good product,"I bought the new Apple HomePod for starting a new home automation system. It has integrated well with all of our other Apple products. The new home automation system is still a work in progress, but so far so good. Will update review as new items are added."
5.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,"Easy setup, easy to use, and great sound!","The mic on the HomePod is also great, it hears you almost every time even with the music is loud. I use it everyday, it's a great addition to my Apple family."
2.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Great Sound, but Disconnects","This speaker sounds good and out of the box, it connected flawlessly. Then it disconnected. Then again. Then again. I've had to unplug and run set up three times now. And I see from others trying to troubleshoot this online that my case is not isolated."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Love the HomePod!,"I recently purchased the HomePod and I love it! The sound quality is great and because of it's circular design, I have equally distributed sound/music throughout my kitchen, dining room, and living room. Looking forward to adding smart home features in order to make Siri the central brains of my home!"
5.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,great speaker plus assistant,"definitely a good buy if your looking for a nice portable speaker for the backyard or something, plus if you also have some phillips hue lights you can adjust lighting through the hey siri feature"
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Unreal sound quality,Sounds like a real home stereo. It’s almost not believable since it sounds so good The down side is you have to use an apple product to control/use it. Wish it had a standard Bluetooth system
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,homepod roomate,I LOVE how homie this product was made. I can ask siri questions and she answers differently than on the an Iphone. With my bloetooth products the homepod works like nothing else out there. And with the price best buy has it going on for. Its an apple steal!
5.0,a year ago,Argos,Awesome Sound,"As a speaker this is an incredible product greatly enhanced by the ability to link two together for immersive stereo sound. Setup couldn't be simpler. As a smart speaker not so clever, but who needs it to be smart? Its a speaker first and foremost and at this it is superb."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Great Speaker,"I bought this item to accompany my new iMac computer, and to listen to my music library. This HomePod has excellent sound quality. I really love my homepod."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Blown away by this SmartSpeaker,"This is my first smart speaker and I was hesitant to spend this much for the HomePod but it was worth it. It was easy to set up and easy to use. I can ask questions, get answers, and endless supply of music. Also, the speaker quality is simply amazing. It auto calibrates for each song based on the room positioning, so you always get the best sound quality. Overall, I highly recommend the Apple HomePod"
5.0,3 weeks ago,ebay.com,As Good as You've Heard,"I was happily surprised to hear the sound quality was great, and the mic pickup is eerily good even when the music is cranked up. It could hear me, when I could barely hear myself with the music playing."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,It’s an awesome speaker!,"Truthfully, I think this speaker has a bit more to go before I would consider it worth buying for $350, but my buddy and I got it for $230 and that definitely made it worth it. The size is bigger than I thought, the sound quality is just flawless, and I feel like Siri is just a tad smarter on the HomePod in certain areas than on iPhones."
5.0,2 years ago,John Lewis,Marvellous I am delighted,"I am sixty five, like good sound but hopeless setting things up, but this is up and working in about two minutes. The sound is simply astonishing, this has taken the place of a very expensive piece of kit I bought a year ago and the sound at different volumes, the clarity are just something else. And Siri is working just fine. Whilst an Apple convert I have no connection with them whatsoever."
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,I love this so much I bought a second one!,"The Apple HomePod is amazing. Sure Siri isn’t Alexa when it comes to AI, but when it comes to audio performance and sound quality, I liked it so much I bought a second one."
5.0,2 years ago,John Lewis,Very good product! - Well Done Apple,"The HomePod was easy to setup, Siri works very well, just ask it to play a track, an artist, an album it will do this without fail (if you have Apple music) I haven't found a way for it to play from my music library just yet. The sound quality isn't as good as the Sonos Play5 (unable to compare to Sonos Play1) overall the sound is very nice and crisp, maybe a little bit pricey, it's a very good product and very happy with the purchase. Looking forward to getting another when multi-room is avaliable"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Excellent sound and great companion for lcd,"I installed a bedroom tv and wall mounted but the sound was very quiet as expected. Using an Apple TV, I bought the HomePod and had it set to play all Audio through the HomePod. Now I have movie like sound in the bedroom!"
5.0,a year ago,bhphotovideo.com,iTunes Match Works Fine,"For those lamenting having to buy Apple Music in order to access their personal library, iTunes Match is still available and works perfectly with Siri on the HomePod. It’s only $25/year and accommodates libraries as large as 100,000 songs. No need for Apple Music."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Excellent Speaker and Sound!!,"Excellent Speaker and Sound, but in terms of intelligent assistance lags behind Amazon and Google. If you’re already into the Apple ecosystem and you are more inclined into sound than AI this is your best option. Also Siri will eventually get better with time as more updates keep coming from Apple in the future."
4.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Great sound quality,"I wanted a smart speaker, but i’m in the Apple community. I like how you can connect to and make a surround sound. I use it on my Phillips Hue lights also. So far, no complaints."
5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,A good deal!,"Great fidelity and clarity (not quite Bose highs for classical, but much better for rock and so all around better speakers). Siri and AirPlay 2 outstanding features and conveniences. Conditon looks like new. Arrived quickly. A good deal at $250."
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Great Personal Assistant,Was a bit skeptical to pay over 300 dollars for a glorified speaker but turns out to be so much more than expected. If you use other apple products I def would reccomend as as the center of any room/home.
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Incredible device,I absolutely live my HomePod. I live being able to control my lights and things around my home. The sound is perfect. I have owned it for a year and I am still just as happy as day one.
4.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Nice Speaker but does nothing else,"Is a good speaker was hoping it would be the Apple version of Alexa but it requires the phone and/or my MacBook to do anything meaningful other than play music. It could be user error, but the documentation is lacking, and I am not able to figure it out (or have the time)."
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Apple home pod,Get this home pod for Christmas and Best Buy had a great price on it . Sound quality is great and works well with Apple Music. Alexa is better than Seri however. Just saying...
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Good sound , not so smart",Kept at the center of the room it sounds really good. Works great on its own and when connected to Apple TV or via airplay from the phone. But Siri isn’t as smart as the she is on the iPhone. I get a lot of ‘cannot answer that’ responses. Hopefully it gets more capabilities down the road .
4.0,4 months ago,John Lewis,Good as a speaker. Lacking as a smart speaker,Sounds great but if you want a smart speaker as flexible as Alexia you’ll be disappointed. You also really need to subscribe to Apple Music to get the most out of it as a speaker
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great speaker and smart system,The sound is pretty amazing with very nice quality. The Siri feature is very convenient to play music and ask questions and etc. I would recommend to all my friends. Another great device from Apple!
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Big sound in a small package,Deep bass and clear sound. Put two of these together and it competes with conventional stereo systems. Weakness is no ability to adjust sound settings. Sometimes the bass is too dominant.
5.0,9 months ago,bhphotovideo.com,Great Product and Service from B&H,B&H offered a great price and delivery window. The HomePad at around $280 is a great performer. Can’t decide between the audio difference of the HomePod versus the Sonos Five.
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,The second one makes a HUGE difference,I bought one HomePod when they first came out. I though it was kinda meh. I bought a second one because it was on sale and HOLY COW! It makes a HUGE difference. Love it!
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Sound Can’t be Beat!,"The HomePod is definitely best for the Apple-Centric, but the sound quality is amazing, HomeKit interfaces with a wide variety of smart devices, and it works pretty seamlessly right out of the box."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Awesome Quality Speaker,"Apple managed to make a great speaker, the sound was loud and clear, very crisp sound. Using Siri to control music, lights, and other HomeKit devices was fantastic, but limited in other features. Ultimately I returned it because I couldn’t justify the price."
4.0,a month ago,ebay.com,Good item. Great Sound,Great product although always a little tricky to install. All the Homepods now need updating which takes a little time. Be patient!
5.0,6 months ago,ebay.com,Audiophile grade product,If you're using this with your Apple gear you will not be disappointed; I have two of them as stereo setup surrounding an iMac and it's amazing I have paradigm studios and prestige speakers for two other systems in my home with marantz and emotiva and parasound amps -- that's my audiophile background If you're worried about not having droid capability or BT connectivity or portability then do not buy this and look for another product
5.0,9 months ago,Argos,HomePod,Very good quality speaker with powerful sound. Apple as always delivered something remarkable Purchasing it from Argos: as always very good experience (friendly staff and super quick)
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Super sound and Apple experience,IF you're in the apple ecosystem look no further! works amazing. I ended up getting 2 for that surround sound stereo experience. Highly recommend.
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Good purchase!,Good size for our kitchen and doesn't take up much counterspace. Sleek design blends in. Sound quality is good although we mostly use it for background music. Overall happy with purchase aside from wishing the cost was a bit less.
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Nice speaker but Sonos is just a little better,"The speaker has an amazing bass but my pair of Sonos one in stereo are a little better. Sonos gets louder than the HomePod and streaming through WiFi beats AirPlay any day, for the simple fact that whatever you’re doing on your phone won’t play through the speaker or stop the music. I’ll buy again once some improvement are made"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Big sound in a small speaker,I love the quality and clarity of my music from the homepod. I tested it against some of the competition and it wasn't even close for me. Would definitely recommend and at the new cheaper price it's a steal
5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,"Great price, just do a factory reset.",Great product. Great price for an open box Homepod. Only thing to note is that you'll need to do a factory reset. Mine was still paired to a past user's device and I noticed another reviewer had that issue as well. Minor problem
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Amazing sound,Amazing sound. Easy to setup. Works perfect as a home hub for anyone who uses the homekit ecosystem. Siri is lacking but she will get smarter over time. If you have invested in the Apple ecosystem then a HomePod will work great for you.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Sound,The HomePod provides excellent sound quality and distributes the sound well in any room. Siri responds promptly even when playing my tunes loudly. A subscription to Apple Music will help you get the most out of this smart speaker.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Excellent,"A no-brainer for the Apple enthusiast, this speaker is also a GREAT sounding device all around. I have two of these, and the sound they project together easily competes with my analog setup (source notwithstanding). PLUS, it's voice controlled and a breeze to setup"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Big things in a small-ish package,"Awesome sound levels, especially the bass lows. Siri is a very useful tool as well as the three months of Apple Music for free as a nice perk. Pairs well with other apple devices, would hiighly recommend."
5.0,a year ago,very.co.uk,Super impressive sound!,"Although sceptical about the big price tag, the sound alone from this speaker sells it. Working with Siri and Apple Music it is a dream pairing. Luckily bought this with the money off offer (covering my insurance, thanks Very!), very happy with the leap. A lovely gift to myself!"
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Absolutely love!,I bought 2 of these last year but we have moved into a bigger house so I had to get another one! The way they work together with my Apple TV’s too they are always aligned together in unison with audio!
5.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Fantastic speaker.,"Wow. This little speaker packs a huge punch with lots of bass for such a little package. If you’re in the Apple world, it works wonderful as a HomeKit hub and voice assistant."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Wow!,"I have many blu tooth speakers, but this by far is the best. You don’ t need your companion device , like phone, tablet, etc. It stands alone and the sound is incredible. Paired with Apple Music it is the best.I’ve had it playing since Santa came and it is now8 hours later."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Great sound,"My husband had tons of speakers for different occasions and this one might honestly replace all of them. Sound is great, portability is good, and looks nice not bulky or awkward looking to have out"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Limited, but AMAZING sound!","I got this so I can use my apple music sub with it easier than I can the crappy Echo I got that only allows very specific ways to listen to music, and your own library, isn't one of them. The sound blows away anything I have used, and although limited in comparison to what Alexa can do, what it does do, is fantastic!"
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Homepod,awesome smart speaker with Siri. Has very nice sound with nice bass too. Also with additional accessories you can have it turn lights on and off.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Super Home Pod,"Siri works great with good sound. Apple needs to add more acknowledgment to hey Siri because The Home Pod overides the phones and iPads. Need option to change the names to Yo Siri, Hello Siri or whatever. I have to whisper to my phone and even that doesnt always work."

4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Great sound, but pricey","The sonics and build quality of this little speaker are impressive. Sounds really nice across the living room. I plan to pick up another for the opposite end of the room at some point. Would love to hear this vs. a pair of Sonos Ones, which can be had for the same price."
5.0,a year ago,Argos,"HomePod, grey","Very detailed and full bodied sound comes out of this unassuming little speaker. Only downside for me is the bass can be too much on some tracks, used the bass reducer option on AirPlay but doesn’t do much. Hopefully future updates will give more control ? Otherwise very happy"
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,The sound,Yep it's great. easy setup if you have an iPhone. The sound is great seems to have just the right bass and lows. I would recommend and get two if you want the best sound.
5.0,2 years ago,littlewoods.com,"Small speaker, BIG sound","I bought this for launch day and it is incredible. The speaker is capabale of filling the entire room with even, high quality sound wherever you stand in the room, something that most speakers can’t do. Siri on the speaker is great with Apple Music and controlling your home so far but with a few software updates, it will only get even more better. Easy for the whole family to use."

5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,"Great Speaker, YES you can stream music","The best sounding speaker I have heard. People complaining about not able to stream 3rd party music services. YOU CAN STREAM 3rd PARTY MUSIC SERIVCES. Use your iPhone or what I use to keep from draining the battery on my iPhone I use my iPod. You can use AIRPLAY to play music through the HomePod. I listen to iHeartRadio, SiriusXM all the time with great sound."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Awesome acoustics,I paired two of them and would have gave 5 stars except that there are times they would unpair and pair again while playing. They do what they are supposed to do and Siri works great as well. I enjoy them.
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great sound not loud,"I have 4 of these throughout the house. They are good, they don’t always communicate with each other so that gets frustrating when trying to play all. Also they just aren’t loud enough... they stay clear at the loudest setting but just need a little more power."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Love my HomePods!,"I know these are expensive but I'm so glad to have waited for Apple's smart speaker. Best sound, best music selection (thanks to Apple Music) and best way for my 70+ year old mom to have Siri control our HomeKit accessories. My only complaint is that I would love for them to be a little cheaper so I can have one in each room."
4.0,a year ago,Argos,Apple Homepod,This is a great speaker for music but it’s not an Alexa yet? If you are looking for one speaker of the highest sound quality and you are an Apple fan this is a must.

5.0,a year ago,Argos,Apple HomePod Space Grey,Superb audio quality and Siri controls that actually work better than expected. Requires I device to set up which proved to be very simple and straightforward. Not for an Android purist as no Bluetooth connectivity and needs an Apple Music subscription to get best results.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Fantastic Audio,"I have several Amazon Echos, but I use Apple Music, so I wanted to try the HomePod. The audio is fantastic.

4.0,10 months ago,Argos,"Spectacular sound - however, Siri needs help",The sound from the HomePod really is room filling and is a joy to listen to. Siri needs a little work and native radio apps would be a bonus too.
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,What can I say?,This speaker has changed my life honestly. Saves me so much times it’s rediculous. So I’m return it’s added more usefullness to my time than scrolling to find a song or trying to find my phone to Change the station.

5.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Fantastic,"Really good quality, fantastic sound but the only down side is that the tone is non-adjustable. The only way to do this is by playing through iTunes from a computer and using the graphic equaliser which is not always convenient. If this could be fixed it would be perfect."
5.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Great Speakers On Sale,Very good speakers for the sale price especially when you have other apple products because they communicate seamless together. Do recommend having two speakers in a home office or small studio.

4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,This thing rocks,I am waiting for the software update where you can pair two of them together. I wish I can hook it to my OLED however via HDMI.

4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Wish there were more native streaming sources,Love the speaker. Wish it had more of the features that the amazon ones do. Would love to be able stream SiriusXM and iHeartRadio stations directly and not through an iPad/phone to the speaker. But Apple truly protects your privacy so...

2.0,a year ago,harveynorman.com.au,It only works well with Apple Music.,"It only works properly if you are using Apple Music and not to mention there is no way whatsoever to connect it to other non-Apple devices which I don't mind, but the fact that Spotify and YouTube Music only works through Airplay. That's a big let down. I'm just going to get a Google Home and put up with the lesser audio quality."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Best bluetooth speaker for the size,There’s better Bluetooth speakers out there for sure but not for this size. The sound fills a small to medium room perfectly. Demos in a very open store like Best Buy may actually sound slightly worse.

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Sound,I bought a pair for stereo. Once I set up iTunes match (24.99 per year) was able to access all iTunes music on my network. Apparently Apple wants you to subscribe to Apple music for 119.88 a year so they make it very difficult to find iTunes match. Compare to B and W or B and O not amazon.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great speaker! Small and unassuming.,If you have everything apple this is definitely a must have specially if you use Apple Music!

4.0,2 years ago,very.co.uk,Same speaker with lots of potential,Amazing sound for a speaker so small. A good addition to any room in the home. Lots of new features coming in the future too. Airplay2 and the ability for Siri to recognise multiple voices (different user accounts). I love the fact that I now have a personal assistant in my living room who plays music on voice command.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Another great product by Apple !!,Sounds amazing. Can't compare to Amazon echo or Google Home in terms of Virtual assistant features. Home Pod will get there pretty soon. Right now only works with apple music or streams anything from mobile. No complaints.
4.0,9 months ago,Argos,Excellent Sound but its a Poor Smart Speaker,"Easy set up, excellent sound, but its not a smart speaker, you need to have an Apple account to use it, and it will only work as a stand alone speaker with Apple apps (ie Apple Music and Podcasts) you can airplay to it from an Apple device but then that device becomes useless as it needs to be in range of the speaker to work If you are into Apple then the sound alone makes it worthwhile, if your not into Apple don't buy it,"
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,"Awesome audio devide, not so awesome voice assista","Siri has a lot to catch up on. While music audio quality is fantastic, Siri is lackluster, doesn’t hold contextual conversations. Hopefully Apple updates the software to make it better."

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Home Pod,Ok right out the door set up was great. Just hold your device and done. However you can not make calls or messages unless your phone is on. It can not access your iCal from the Home Pod I get first generation but the calendar should be available. The sound is wonderful and it hears me from anywhere in the room. HomeKit works easily.

5.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Fantastic speakers and Siri integration,"I now have 3 of these, shame there is no way of bulk buying to get a discount. But it’s worth the outlay if you want your Apple Music around the house and full Siri integration. Limited instructions in the box bit the phone helps you through installing and was very simple."
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Awesome,This is a great speaker if you have all or a majority of apple products. I am not as worried about the virtual assistant part but as an Apple TV speaker and home hub it does a great job and is extremely easy to setup.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Outstanding sound.,The best part of these is the sound. I find that Alexa can do more and understand more but the Siri function on this can hear your voice with loud noise in the background better than the echo dot.
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Apple,"My household is all apple, we believe in their products. Best Buy Gad the best price for this item and the store associates we’re extremely friendly and helpful in finding it and checking out."

3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Not quite ready,Sound quality is decent with good bass from such a small speaker. Ended up purchasing two Sonos speakers for less money and they unquestionably sound better. Siri not connecting to web is shameful.

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great product.,The sound quality is unbelievable I think it rivals Bose speakers. I wish Siri could do more like answers questions than tell me can not find that on HomePod. I do love that it can play all the millions of songs that are part of Apple Music or control your HomeKit accessories.
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Great sound, not great smart features","Sound quality is excellent and arguably competitively priced even at 350 (but especially at the 250 I got it for), however lack of Bluetooth and the underwhelming capabilities and quirks of Siri and HomeKit leave a bit to be desired. Would recommend for a smart Sonos alternative but not much else"
4.0,a year ago,Argos,Love the Apple HomePod,Easy to set up (although my daughter did it for me) but she said it synchs to the iPhone really easily. Sound quality is great but waiting to download the app that allows you to get more from the HomePod. Might even buy another one later to get stereo sound!
5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Lovely product,Very high quality and great sounding speakers. Really fills the room and Siri picks up even the faintest voice when calling it. Can easily hear you over music even at 100%. Would highly recommend to everybody

5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,"Look & Sound Great, but...","I bought two Apple Homepods so that I could have them for stereo in my lounge. They look good, sound excellent and were easy to set up. I haven't given ""good value"" because Homepods are quite expensive and not as versatile as some other offerings."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great!!!,I purchased two home pods and they sound amazing together. Sound wise these are the best speakers I've had. Siri isn't as useful as other assistants but I'm not much of an assistant user. I do use it every morning for news and the weather.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Excellent for a purpose,"Won’t compete with a (very) good 2.1 setup, but excellent for situations that call for minimal hardware presence. Could be primary or secondary home, dorm, you name it. Best used with an iTunes library or Apple Music subscription."

1.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Seriously?,Setup was more painful then it should have been. Took several minutes for my iPhone X to pick it up. Sound is crisp and clean but where is the volume???! Compared next to a pair of Sonos play 1’s and I would highly recommend them over the HomePod for the same price. Very disappointing as I’m a huge apple fan but I will be returning tomorrow and sticking with my Sonos system
4.0,a year ago,very.co.uk,Quality sound,"For a small speaker the sound quality is fantastic. I’ve found a few glitches with the software/home automation etc, but hopefully these will be ironed out in the planned software update.

1.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Not a great buy,I bought this thinking I could use it to get recipes and everything but it didn't meet my expectations. You ask it something and all it tells you is that it can't help you. And it only plays Apple music which you have to buy

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Amazing sound,"Although the store makes it difficult to buy (it’s not even on display and you have to ask for it in the back), this smart speaker Is worth the fine. You’re not going to find sound like this elsewhere in a speaker of its size. Despite what you may hear about Siri not being as smart as others, it does everything I ask you to do."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Actually Great!,"i was unsure about getting this speaker but this speaker has the best sound quality I've ever heard, i thought that siri was going to suck but it actually works better then on the phone. i can actually talk to siri like normal and she works every time. the bass i can feel through the floor and the sound is crisp and clear, i think apple will make siri more capable of features in updates so im not worried about that, its a little pricey but i think its well worth the money now"

5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Love it!,Love my HomePod. Sound is amazing. Much easier to connect via airplay over bluetooth. I even hooked up my appletv to it and it sounds better than my Sony soundbar. I can’t wait for airplay 2 and I’ll buy another to use as my living room surround sound. I’m an all around Apple person so it fits my needs perfectly. I do have Amazon dots and now use Siri exclusively.

My only complaint is that while trying to talk to Siri on my phone, HomePod often answers by saying, “I can’t do that.” I find myself trying to whisper to my phone so HomePod won’t hear me. Silly."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,I didn’t want to like it!,I didn’t want to like it! But it convinced me. The home pod can only get better from this point. The sound quality is great. It’s looks are perfect and the controls are awesome. It made me want to get an Apple Music subscription.

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Awesome Sound,"We set the homepod up in our living room-setup was super easy, and the sound is very impressive.

3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,It’s my biggest disappointment,"You can’t connect the device to Bluetooth, it does not play in stereo and you can’t play your music library by using Siri, you have to play it through your iPhone or iPod to get your library I recommend the Bose 500 speaker which blows this speaker away. You need 3 homepods to have stereo"

3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great With Apple Music Subscription,Apple has perfected the sound quality with this device. Siri is not a powerful force yet. I would suggest google home device if you are looking for something that offers more.

4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Works for Me,"I bought a second HomePod to use them in stereo. They sound great and are fast to trigger HomeKit commands. They’re not as “smart” in the sense of having as many skills as an Alexa device. But what they can do, they do well."

5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,POWERFUL!,This thing is powerful and I absolutely love it! I had to turn it down because the BASS is insane. I want to turn it all the way up just to test it out but that's the apartment life for ya! I will order another one maybe midyear! Siri does the job although limited in function for now! If you're android then I don't recommend you buying this ;)
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,"Good sound quality, big price tag",It's a great speaker but comes with a hefty price. Offers good features with Apple ecosystem.
5.0,2 years ago,Argos,Simply the best,It was worth waiting for and now Amazon and Google really need to worry. The Home Pod was a joy to unbox right through to setting up the Phillips Hue smart lights around the house. The sound is deep and full with the internal microphones controlling the sound depending where you place the Home Pod in the room. This will not be the last Home Pod we have!
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Couldn’t be happier.,Couldn’t be happier. It fills the room with music. Will go out and buy another one so I have stereo. Siri is better with the HomePod.

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great sound - could use more integrations,"Once you figure out how to use airplay to do more than just play your songs in the cloud, it's wonderful! Listening to podcasts and radio stations with this means I can actually hear them!"

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,This thing is a beast,I’m really enjoying the HomePod. I have this connected to my Appletv as an actual soundbar for DirecTv Now and my other tv apps. I can’t wait until Airplay2 arrives so that I can buy another one to create stereo and surround sound.
4.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Great,"I love this and the sound is amazing for music, podcasts, as well as watching movies with it in my Apple TV. Only thing that I have a problem with is that Siri on the HomePod is kind of stupid."

5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,I love it.,"Just a great gadget. I love that sound. Is true that is not available in Spanish (and I am in Mexico), but no doubts it will be soon....even that is not a problem. Just some simple commands and everyone can use it. In a fact, sounds great."
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Serves its purpose,"The perfect speaker for Apple users. It also connects to your HomeKit so you can control your lights if you have lutron or another home smart app set up. My only concern is that sometimes it doesn’t work (turning on the lights) because Siri doesn’t recognize what i want turned on, but i think it’s a problem via Home app, not the HomePod itself."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great sounding speaker,Great sounding speaker not as well for smart speaker but great for music also can assess Apple Music love it

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Sounds amazing,The sound quality and music selection with Apple Music makes this a must. Alexa has better connection with smart home stuff but the sound sucks and she plays the same music every over and over.
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Siri is still dumb,I’m an Apple fan and this is a good speaker in its own right and it’s neat being able to control HomeKit devices without being tethered to a device. Siri just doesn’t do things like google or Alexa.
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Not good enough yet,As you may already know it sounds pretty good. The base was too much for me. The microphones are incredible. It does not sound as good as stereo speakers and you can’t pair two of them to work as stereo speakers.
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Amazing speaker,Christmas gift for daughter. Seen other reviews that said it can’t do much but I’m giving this to her to be a speaker and a treat sounding one at that she is deeply invested in apples ecosystem. I know she will love this.

3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Disappointed,Not the high tech masterpiece I hoped for! Very pricey but I just don’t see the value or the high end sound Apple promises. If you don’t have Apple Music and/or Apple TV you limit its uses tremendously.
4.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Great for a bedroom.,"We bought this for my daughters bedroom, she loves it and it sounds great! Easy to connect and no drop out of connection- like the JBL she previously had."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great Sounding Speaker,Really an outstanding speaker - especially when paired w another one. Personally I don’t use it much for Siri etc...

3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Not worth the money,First Gen Apple Product. Sounds OK to me for the price. Harman Kardon Onyx Studio has better speakers from my experience. You can find it for under $150 online or in best buy some times.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Kids love it,It works as advertised. Only downside is the kids fight about what song to have Siri play. Not apples fault my kids love to use it

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Recommended,One of the best products. Perfect sound. Deep bass. But it’s impossible to connect to tv
2.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Ok but typical Apple,The sound was okay but unfortunately this is one of those times that Apple doesn’t want to play in the sand box with other. Can’t stream Spotify and you’re better off getting a speaker that works across many platforms.
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Pretty good for what it is,"Slightly disappointed that the AirPlay 2.0 is still unavailable, this doesn't work as advertised. Apple has taken over a year to enable it. The sound is pretty darn good, looking forward to add on subwoofer options."
