5.0,3 months ago,lowes.com,"Great way to get started with a ""smart home""","Not only has this been fun to use, it's making my life a whole lot simpler. So, here's the scoop on this very affordable way to make your home a smart home. Google mini vs Google Home and Google Nest. Basically, it's the speaker size (and Home has a screen) as each of them basically do the same thing. The mini is a lot less expensive and this package also comes with a smart light bulb which will save you $20 right off the top. The speaker size is fine for me as I just want to listen to the music I don't need to blast it throughout the entire house. However, with that being said, if I wanted to blast it throughout the house, I would just ask Google to turn on the other speakers I've paired with the mini. Set up was easy, all you need is a smart phone to download the Google home app and do the set up, then you'll need WiFi reaching anywhere you've got a smart device you want to add and run through the mini. It's really that simple. The cool thing about having the app installed on your smart phone is that you can also run the smart devices through your phone anywhere in the world, rather than the mini. I've got the following things running through this mini. 15 lights throughout the house 6 outlets Home Security system Smart thermostat 7 speakers ( no more yelling to find people on different floors) Garage door opener Unreachable window blinds Smart refrigerator Things I'm now able to do with the mini: See inside my frig too see what I need to buy while at the store Access my grocery list Set timers while cooking Get reminders about tasks Adjust the blinds by just saying ""hey Google, close the blinds"" Leave messages for others in the home Turn on and off special lighting like Christmas trees Turn lights on and off without having to access a switch in the dark Change the temp in the house through the app or by asking the mini Arm and disarm the security system Open and close the garage door in case someone needs to get in and we're not home. Turn the TV on/off change channels, find particular movies, change volume any function you could need to do on your tv. (This uses Chromecast) Stream music Hear the current and forecasted weather without having to touch my phone Get news in real time Get answers to basically any question you can think of Communicate with others in different areas of the house without having to yell. I'm sure there are many more things I'll add as I continue learning more of what's available and adding more smart devices. All in all, I love this and have found it to be a very handy and fun item to have. The only negative thing I could add is that adding other smart light bulbs is rather costly, expect to pay $20 for EACH bulb... I definitely recommend the mini though."
5.0,3 months ago,lowes.com,Functional small speaker with big sound,"The “Smart Light Starter Kit” consists of 2 products – the Google Mini Smart Speaker and as Smart Light. You need to 1st set up the speaker in order to set up the light, unless you already have existing Google hub. Setting up the speaker was a breeze – I already had Google Home app on my phone, it recognized the speaker and in few minutes it was up and running. Setting up the light was even faster – I turned it on and the app took over and in a minute or so it was ready to go. You can assign each product to a room, which makes it easier to control down the road – i.e. “Game room”, “Bathroom”, “Tony’s room” and so on. The kit gets 5 stars for set up. The light is easily controlled both – from the app or through the Mini by using common sense commands. For example “Hey Google, set the light in the Movie Room at 30%” and the light will deem appropriately, or set it at 100% and it’ll glow at its full brightness. I tested it’s functionality by using the app on my phone while on mobile network (not on home’s WiFi and the light reacted accordingly, which comes handy if you’d like to use it while away on vacation. You should be able to set a vacation schedule as well, but I’ve not tested that yet. The only downside of the light is that it’s 60W equivalent with about 800 lumens of light output, which is OK for a small room, but in a larger room you’ll need several of these to be able to achieve the necessary brightness in the room. The Mini executes verbal commands really quick, and given the fact that I have an accent – it does a really good job! The Mini is surprisingly good speaker, given the tiny size – under 4” diameter and under 1.5” thick. It’s loud enough to fill in very large living area – it feels like you can clearly hear the music in the entire house. Google did a good job in adjusting the equalizer of the speaker as you change the volume up or down so that you don’t hear the annoying distortion that’s common at high volume for most small speakers. In my own tests I find the sweet spot to be around 60-65% of the volume. That will vary depending on source (streaming online directly from the speaker, cast from your phone or computer), type of music, and quality of the records, but in general above that level the speaker will start cutting down the lows and while the sound remains clear, you will notice the missing bass. When you lower the volume to about 40% you’ll notice amazing details and really pleasant low frequency fullness of the music. You can control the volume level with you voice by saying “Hey Google, set the volume of Game room speaker at 60%”, use the Google Home app on your phone, or use the “tap” sensitive areas on both sides of the speaker to increase or decrease it. One thing you need to keep in mind though – when you play your musing loud, you will have to communicate with your Mini much louder than normal :-) One of the best things I like about the Mini is the fact that it has a hardware click/slider button to turn the mic off or on as you wish. When you slid the button of the microphone control to “Off” position – the 4 speaker lights on top of it will turn amber color and each time you shake the speaker or turn it on it’ll tell you that “By the way, the microphone is turned off” The mini comes with a wall charger with hard wired to the plug cable with USB micro to be plugged into the speaker. The plug is rated for output of 5V at 1.8A, which in general is more than what you need for a phone and less from what you need for a tablet. Given these characteristics I tried to use the speaker as a portable speaker by plugging it into a USB battery pack that has 2A rated output. This didn’t go really smooth… - the speaker rebooted several times for no apparent reason, so I’d guess it didn’t have proper power supply. I then connected it to a “brand name” battery and it did better – played for some time, but when I cranked the volume to 90% the speaker rebooted. I’m not frustrated with this findings as the product is designed to be plugged into a 120V outlet, but would be convenient to take it with you from the office to the bathroom without interrupting you audiobook or podcast. I also used the “Google Home” app on my phone to “Call Home” and it immediately invoked “Duo” and called the Mini – very convenient (I can call my son to lower the volume of his game without leaving my bed on Sunday morning :) ) I’d definitely recommend this product. It really worked as advertized - both the speaker and the light."
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Solid Combo Makes a Good Smart Home Starting Point,"If you're invested in the Google ecosystem and just starting out with smart devices this combo is a great introduction, and if you already have Google smart devices in your home then this could be a convenient way to extend coverage into additional rooms. These are Google Assistant devices so people who are already using other Google products and services will get the most out of this combo. Set up and integration between the Home Mini and the Smart Light is quick and painless - surprisingly painless, in fact. I tend to have low expectations when setting up new devices but I was glad to be proven wrong in this case. Within minutes I was controlling the light through the Home Mini, listening to my music, and playing content on a Chromecast. Prior to purchasing this combo I had used my phone to stream content from Google services and I can unequivocally say that using the Home Mini to control content selection and playback is a clearly better experience. Interactions are quick, accurate, and consistent and the default voice has a pleasantly personable quality without falling into the uncanny valley. I had been using a Gen 1 Echo Dot before purchasing this combo and I'm impressed with the quality of the Home Mini compared to the Dot. The build quality feels more substantial, I prefer the industrial design, and to my ears the Home Mini produces better sound. I've also found that the responses to general questions from Google Assistant tend to be more accurate than the responses from Alexa. Also, when using Alexa I felt as though purchases were suggested more frequently and forcefully. For example, if a specific song requested was only available through a subscription, Alexa would inform you that the song required a subscription, play a snippet of the song and then continue with a related playlist. Google Assistant, on the other hand, only made a note of the subscription requirement and went directly to a related playlist. The Smart Light is... well, it's a dimmable smart home connected soft white light bulb. It paired quickly to the Home Mini and works consistently. As far as negatives - any concerns one may have with connected home devices as a product category certainly still exist with the Home Mini. You're sending a lot of information to a third party, and your feelings about that are going to depend on how you feel about that third party. If you don't trust Google then a speaker puck and light bulb combo aren't going to change that. This is just more Google in more places, for good or ill."
1.0,2 months ago,lowes.com,I don't know what went wrong??? Bulb doesn't work,"I bought the kit on Black Friday 2019 for $20 because I couldn't pass up such a great deal and an extra two pack of the c-life bulbs priced at $9.99 from $24.99 to scatter some ""smart lights"" around the house. I got home and placed the bulb from the kit in the lamp. I followed the setup on my app for Google home as I already have the main Google device in another room of the house, so I was already familiar with the way it works. Well, the light blinked and was found by the app, but during the process, somewhere along the line, the connection dropped off. I was getting a ""something went wrong"" screen and the light bulb and app couldn't finish setup. So then I went online to see what people said about issues and potential fixes. I came across the Youtube video about resetting the bulb - because essentially it's a little computer brain in the bulb, right? Well, I kid you not, for almost two hours and different locations throughout my home, I repeated the factory reset and tried the google home setup process over, and over, and over. I turned my phone on an off, Bluetooth on and off multiple times, reset the bulb multiple times, updated my Google home app, downloaded the c-life app, all to no avail. I guess you could call me a millennial, although I argue I am in a set of micro-generations as I can't fully identify with all of the millennial attributes (lol), but my point is that due to my age and technical experience, I'm pretty good at ""internet stuff"". So the set up for this bulb to the google home mini was extremely irritating to me. The Google mini works great, I am happy with the purchase if only to get the mini at the price of $20 to add to my room, but the whole idea was to be able to control at least one light if we are away and want to appear to be at home. SO, if you take away anything from my review, it's to be prepared for an issue with the bulb at setup, watching the Youtube video for factory reset, only to be let down, and then eventually giving up and deciding the bulb will act as a bulb in the cabinet until I can muster enough patience to try this again one day. I didn't read any reviews until AFTER the setup failed...but to be honest, I would've bought it anyway at $20 :) One star since the duo doesn't work. If there was an option to add stars for value, it would be 5."
4.0,4 months ago,lowes.com,Nice if you don't mind privacy issues,"First off, let's be clear. The kit includes a smart bulb and a Google mini. You don't have to have one to use the other and I'm not sure why they say to put them in the same room. Maybe during setup but afterwards you can put them anywhere your wifi reaches. Although this review is for the Mini and smart bulb combo, since the Mini is so closely integrated with Google Home, it should be mentioned: I have twenty something devices already, other brand smart switches, plugs, and security cameras and they all integrated with no problem into the Google Home app. The Google Mini, once succesfully added to the Home app picked all the devices right up and worked perfectly. I also connected my Pandora app to the Mini for music streaming but I expect I'll use my Onkyo receiver that has Pandora built in because choosing between streaming music on a surround system versus a single little tabletop speaker... well, yeah. You can also cast from your Mini to other devices but, although I didn't test it, I'm sure it requires ChromeCast. There are not a lot of detailed directions other than basic setup and a few examples of different ways to use your Mini. When using voice commands in Google Home via the Mini, it's helpful to rename your devices to short common identifiers you can easily remember versus what title they may have in other apps. For example, my Kasa app has things listed by what they are, then by their specific name, i.e.; my living room table lamp is called ""light - living room table"". Rather than have to use that specific phrase, I can rename it within the Google Home app to just Table Lamp and use that phrase to control that lamp. The Home app separates devices by room where my other apps just list them by name so when I say ""turn on the living room table lamp"", I can have multiple table lamps in different rooms and it knows that I'm talking about the ""table lamp"" in the ""living room"". If you just say turn on the ""table lamp"" and you have multiple devices labeled ""table lamp"", it will turn them all on so you probably want to specify the room. This seems elementary but it took me a while to figure it out and maybe this will help the new user. I'm sure this little cloth covered eavesdropper does lots more. You can turn off the built in microphone with a little switch on the side, although that pretty much eliminates it's usefulness. I see where it can help me find my phone. That might be helpful when I've set it down and can't remember where."
5.0,3 months ago,lowes.com,Good smart speaker + home automation platform,"I have been using SmartThings for several years, so have much of my house automated and have been happy with the way it works (from my phone). However, I decided to give this platform a chance to compare as well as to add a smart speaker and additional smart bulb. Given this, I'm very familiar with zigbee, zwave, bluetooth, wifi smart products. I was hoping to see the automation platforms be significantly advanced from my 2nd generation SmartThings, therefore I was disappointed that it took me 3 tries to pair the bulb to the Google Home Mini. The Mini immediately recognized the light and the bulb blinked 3x, so it was recognized... but after going through the steps to add it on the app, it somehow got lost. I searched for how to reset the light and went through the process of turning it on for 8 seconds and then off for 2 seconds (repeat 5x), then tried to add again with zero success. Once again, I had to reset. 3rd time was the charm... same experience I've had with SmartThings, so I'd recommend not trying to automate your home unless you're ready to learn how to overcome the issues. It's still not as easy as plug-and-play. That said, once I got through the 3rd time, the bulb has worked perfectly. Having a smart speaker is a nice addition. Being able to ask google to turn something on and off (or dim) is nice, but I am ok with simply picking up my phone and pushing a button too. The speaker comes in handy when doing other things though, like cooking with your hands dirty and asking to set a timer, asking for a specific radio station or type of music, etc. Kids love asking it questions, but we had a couple times where we got curse words back and had to quickly stop it (there are ways to block explicit lyrics if you set it up to recognize a kids voice / set up parental controls). Overall, we like it, but we keep the microphone turned off most of the time. A little privacy is good, and that's our favorite part of the entire hub... the ability to cut off the microphones at a hardware level. Without that switch, I would have given this product 4 stars... but the microphone mute switch knocked it back up to 5."
5.0,3 months ago,lowes.com,WARNING – You’ll Want More!,"This was my first experience with any smart home tech, and I absolutely LOVE IT! Not only can you control the light bulb with simply your voice, but you also have the option to control it from an app on your phone from anywhere in the world (as long as you have internet connection to both your phone and your bulb). It should be noted that this bulb will require a constant power supply even when it’s ‘off’, for it to work properly. So, you probably won’t be using this bulb in your ceiling lights, unless you want to leave the switch on 24/7. If you are looking for that kind of control, you should look into getting a smart switch instead. This bulb is best suited in something like a bedside lamp – something that is always plugged in. I found this to be rather useful for that very purpose. Not only has this solved the fight every night about who’s going to get out of bed to turn off the light, but you can also setup routines through the Google app to automate turning on and off the light. As a practical example, I have an automated routine set to turn on the light 10 minutes before my alarm goes off every morning. This has allowed me to have already begun waking up by the time my alarm rings, which helps me to feel better rested and ready to get up instead of the normal shock that comes from being jarred awake out of a dead sleep. As far as the Google Home Mini itself, I’ve been super impressed with its volume and range. Its max volume is more than you’d ever need, even in a large open room. And, I’ve consistently had it recognize my command from the next room (when I’m shouting of course). But, that said, if you’re in the general vicinity of the device, you never really have to raise your voice for it to recognize your request. Additionally, I love the built in games, sleep sounds, news and music options, etc. This starter kit has awoken a NEED for smart home tech inside of me! I’ve already purchased a smart garage door opener, which is controlled seamlessly with the Google Home Mini. Additionally, I’m looking to purchase a couple more of these for around the house, and upgrade some of my existing ‘dumb’ light switches to smart switches. Smart Home products are no longer the way of the future… they are here now! And this package is a great starting place for anyone looking to dip their toe in the water!"
5.0,3 months ago,lowes.com,An easy way the start the home automation journey!,"With regards to my background, I have setup every room of my house with Google Assistant devices, smart lights, outlets and/or switches. I used this kit to extend that automation into one last room that was not previously in range of any of my existing voice assistants and had a lamp that I wanted to be able to both turn on/off and adjust brightness. The setup required to get this kit up and running was negligible for my situation and would be very easy for those that had no previous home automation. It took me about 5 minutes to have the room up and running with this kit. If I had to start from scratch, it might take a whole 10 minutes. Aside from this kit and and wifi, all you need is electricity and the ""Home"" app by google. The Google Home Mini is easy to install and use. Once configured (via the Home app) to your location and wifi, it is ready to start responding to your requests and instructions. Whether you are telling it to dim the lights or asking it what the current time is in Bangkok, Thailand, it is ready to respond. Honestly, the more you use it, the more you will use it. The smart light bulb looks like a standard light bulb. All you need to do is screw it into a light socket and turn the socket on, then use the Home app to discover and control it. Generally speaking, most devices that interface with either Google Home or ... the other massive online retailer's voice assistant app ... require that you setup another app (and another account) that actually controls the device. Your voice assistant would then interface with the other app in order to control the device. This works, but you will soon discover that either you need to standardize on a limited number of brands of smart devices or face having a large number of apps and accounts spread across all of your devices. Not so with the light bulb included with this kit. No additional apps are required and it sets up the interface for the Google Assistant to use. It is practically invisible to you. This makes the setup even easier and less prone to issues. Now for a dose of reality, follow the directions to setup the light bulb very precisely. I would even encourage you to read the instructions completely before starting the install (something that I seldom do). If you make a mistake installing the bulb ... and if you need to factory reset the bulb in order to start over ... be prepared for a process that is anything but obvious. In order to factory reset the bulb, you must go through a timed sequence of manually turning it on and off (it is something like ""off for 2 seconds, on for 8 seconds"" repeated 5 times followed by ""off for 2 seconds, on for 2 seconds, off for 2 seconds, then on""). The timing has to be pretty close and it took me several tries to reset my bulb after I did something that I should not have and lost my app access to the bulb. This could be extremely frustrating, but if you follow the instructions, you should not have to live through this particular purgatory. Finally, who is this kit for? My suggestions would be: apartment dwellers, those who live in dorm rooms, those that are curious about trying home automation, and, finally, those like me, that just need to extend their existing automation to another space."
4.0,3 months ago,lowes.com,Great Start Kit for Smart Home,"I am a professional geek, and I have had an Amazon Echo for years, but the Google Nest Hub Mini is currently a much better option today in my opinion. Buying a Google Nest Hub is the only way to get access to the Google Assistant, which I think is much nicer than the Amazon Echo Alexa. The Hub Mini is not perfect, but it is really a leap in the right direction. It ties in with my other Nest Thermostats too. I won't waste time on how you can get the news, weather, sports, recipes and other information right when you need them just by asking. You do need a smart phone or tablet to set up the device with Google Home App, and you can't even adjust the audio bass and treble without the App. Why can't they add some voice requests so I don't need to go find my phone or tablet just to adjust the sound? You also can't add a Nest Thermostat or smart bulb directly from the Hub, you must use a phone or tablet. It does have a touch volume control, but is awkward to use. And on the back, a mic cutoff switch. I'm hoping in another ten years the technology will catch up with our expectations, as I can't understand why I need a seperate App only on smart phones or tablets to set this up. This could be easily achieved today by just providing this as an App on a Google Chrome Book. We all would probably get more use out of a smart home laptop/tablet while still buying a Google device. I would also like it rechargeable with a wireless dock so that I can pick up the speaker and take it with me around the house. The bulbs are a natural color, but I prefer bright white instead, and are easily dimmable by voice control. I would like options in the bulb wattage for larger rooms. I nice starter kit, but still room for improvement.Less"
5.0,3 months ago,lowes.com,Amazing device,"The Google mini is an absolute necessity after having tried it. At first I did have a hard time figuring out the settings to get it to work with my contact list and finding my grocery list and some other things. Once I finally figured it out and was able to really use it to its full potential it has been amazing. I can find my phone with the ringer off and stuck in the couch somewhere by asking Google. It turns the ringer on loud and will call your phone. This is the most genius feature I have ever used on any device. That in itself is a selling point alone Lol. I can ask it to set timers, alarms, shut off lights, play music, ask it jokes, weather, the meaning of a word, calculations, text or call my husband, anything you want. It will play quiz games with you, read you a book, the list goes on. My husband and I who are 38 and 39 have never had one of these AI types of devices and I love this thing so much. I can ask it to give me a recipe on the fly, to add to my grocery list and so on. It's small, lightweight, gorgeous aesthetics, you can ask it to volume up or down without touching it or can just taps the side with your finger, it won't respond just by saying Google which is nice. You have to say hey Google or ok Google. They make it so you do need one for every room however. My living room is right next to my open kitchen and the unit is maybe 10 or so feet away but you have to yell at it for it to hear you from that distance otherwise it can hear you fine in a closer proximity without any problems. However having one in every room is not bad because then you can talk to people in other rooms by broadcasting to them or you can listen to music on all the speakers simultaneously if you chose to maybe while cleaning your house, an elegant party with a house full of guests and light music throughout, or something to that effect. Honestly I am not sure how we lived without it all this time and wouldn't want to go back. I do like utilizing it More than I ever would have for the phones Mic because you have to wake the phone, unlock the phone, and then say hey Google such and such. For me it was too much effort so I just never utilized it but this you just talk to and whatever it is, is acknowledged without having to touch anything. One thing to note is if you are using your phone and talking to the Google mini, your phone will pick up your question or command and sometimes it gets annoying. Not a deal breaker, just worth noting. I definitely want more components that go to this system in the future. It can turn the smart light on and off as well as dim to any shade needed and programmed to have different settings for different atmosphere. The cord is nice and long to plug into the wall and a quality cord. I plan on buying more bulbs to go with this. All in all I am very impressed with this unit, so much so this is definitely going g to be on a Xmas list for my 71 year old mother. I think she will get a kick out of this."
4.0,3 months ago,lowes.com,"Nice combo pack, but with a warning.","(NOTE - the bulb NEEDS the Mini to work, so don't think you can split this duo up like I wanted to do. I thought I could just use the app for the bulb, but no.) I enjoy using the GE C-Life lightbulb in my bedside lamp! When moving to my new home and after getting setup with my new cable company, I learned that a lot of the smart plugs out there do not work with the new 5ghz wifi, so my plugs were no longer usable. With this GE light I am able to once again have my bedside lamp automatically turn on in the evening so I do not have to walk across a dark room. The other thing I love is that I can adjust the brightness - too cool! I'm thinking of seeing if I can get another bulb to work outside on my front porch so that we don't have to keep remembering to turn it off and on each morning and night. We mainly use the backdoor as our main entrance so the front door is not often on our minds. WARNING: I did not realize that in order for any of the GE C-Life lightbulbs to work, it has to be connected to a hub, which is why the Goolge Home Mini is included since it will work as the hub. I am an Amazon Alexa household so I was not prepared to have 2 pucks on my nightstand. But during setup I realized that as long as I had the Google Home app installed on my phone, I could use that to control the bulb and have the Mini in another NEARBY location (my master bath). So through the app I set the on and off times, can turn it off and on, and change the brightness. Since I always have my phone, this is not a problem. I can even say ""Hey Google, turn off the lamp"" and let my phone do the work for me. I was hoping to give the Mini to my mother to use in her room across the home, but the bulb needs the Mini to work. As for the Mini, I thought it would be smaller. Its the exact size of an Echo Dot if that helps anyone. The one drawback I have come across is that there are no buttons on it to adjust volume. I know you can tell it to adjust the volume, but I always used the buttons on my Dots if I was next to it as it is just faster that way to go up or down multiple levels. This is a pretty nice combo pack and looks to be at a great price for what you get."
4.0,3 months ago,lowes.com,Smart light starter kit,"Inside the Smart Light Starter Kit you get a Google Home Mini smart speaker and a GE smart led light. The Google Home Mini is a miniature version of the Google Home with the major differences being cost and the speaker sound quality. The GE smart led bulb is a very basic bulb that can be turned on and off using the mini or the switch on your wall (the switch must me on for the Mini to control it). If you are considering experimenting with smart home technology, but are a bit nervous, a light is an easy and straightforward start. Once you set up your kit (and name your light ie. “attic light”), then all it takes is “OK GOOGLE”, “Turn on attic light.” That’s all there is to it. With that being said, the setup is always the frightening part. The kit does make it very easy. To set up the system, 1. Screw in the light and turn on the wall switch, 2, Plug in power to the Mini and it instructs you to download the app on your phone or tablet, 3. Open the app and it connects to the Mini, 4. Simply follow the instruction on the app and answer a few questions. The app will automatically search for “smart” devices such as your light. You tell the app where the device is (living room, attic etc), name the device (ie. “attic light” or whatever you want) and the system is then ready to use. There are a number of options you can defer during setup and change later if you want, so don’t get concerned if you click “Later” during setup. The Google Home Mini really should get a review all to itself, but there is not enough space here for that... Just to say the Mini is so much more powerful than simply a light switch and could become relied on as part of your everyday life (much like our smart phones). At about $45, the starter kit is an inexpensive survey into smart home tech. The Mini is approximately $35-$40 depending on where you shop and the bulb is around $8 so you could get both separately for about the same money. Honestly, there are much nicer bulbs for only a dollar or two more that, to me, would have been a better choice to include in the kit to show off the capability, and of course, the versatility of the technology with no more setup. For $3 to $5 dollars you can get a dimmable, color changing (soft white, bright white or even blue, green, red…) light that would generate an awe factor, instead of just off and on. Pros: Easily set, inexpensive kit, expandable Cons: Very basic bulb Conclusion: The kit is easy to set up. The bulb is basic and a good choice for an attic or closet. The Google Home Mini is extremely versatile and is categorically under-utilized with only a light. If you are interested and want to explore smart home tech, then the Smart Light Starter kit is an economical choice, but a more versatile light in the kit would have been a great addition."
4.0,3 months ago,lowes.com,"Mini Device, Huge Possibilities","With any purchase of a product, you need to make sure that it will cover your needs or do what you want it to do. With any smart device, you want it to be compatible with as many other smart devices you may have so you have a cohesive network. If you are purchasing this to be the one and only smart device in your home then you may not need to pay much attention to that. This little device is a standalone hub so you can connect devices directly to it such as the lightbulb that it comes with and operate them with voice commands. I mainly run SmartThings in my home to which the Google Home Mini runs seamlessly. This hub hears commands very clearly and responds promptly. We mainly run Amazon Echo’s throughout our home so it was nice to get a side by side comparison. The sound quality is very good and comparable to the Echo Dot 3. Because the Nest Hub is backed by Google, it can find relevant answers to just about any question you throw at it whereas the Echo sometimes just can’t find one. The one thing I have a love/hate relationship with is the volume control. You can easily adjust the volume by just touching the sides at the same time. This also means anytime you pick up the device, you inadvertently adjust the volume.

5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,The best smart speaker for most people,"I have perhaps too many smart devices in my household. I don't really use light switches anymore - I have an app for that. The same goes for running the vacuum, mopping the kitchen, and choosing what to watch on Netflix. Pretty much the only way my home functions at all is thanks to smart speakers and personal assistants like this one - and I have quite a few. From massive electric monoliths to wearables to smart screens, I've tried just about every variant of the Google home you can get. And so far I don't think I've found any that can beat the Home Mini. Yes, there are some areas where it's underwhelming. The built in speakers are just okay. It doesn't have a screen to watch videos on, or a clock. And you can't stick batteries in it and take it camping with you. But you also can't just stick any of the devices that do have all those on a wall behind a desk and pretend like you're Captain Picard as you turn off the lights with your voice. While those more complex Home devices all have their purposes, the mini is the only one cheap enough and versatile enough to fill your house with. They are essentially the backbone that enables my home automation system, and I rarely ever find that I miss the better speakers or colorful touchscreens. If you've got any kind of interest in home automation or simply rely on your Google Assistant on your phone to manage your schedule, this is where you should start looking.Less"
4.0,3 months ago,lowes.com,Great dimmable light,"I already had the Google Home app on my phone. So, setting up the included Google Home Mini was very easy to do. I don't like the volume of the thing when I plugged it in and couldn't figure out how to adjust it prior to connecting to the app. Very limited instructions come with the kit. After the mini connected, I tried to add the bulb. The Home app recognized the bulb, the bulb flashed like it was connecting, and then, nothing. The Google help link was actually not that helpful. I Googled ""can't connect ge smart bulb to google home,"" which took me to a Google support thread, where someone provided a link to a GE support page for the bulb. The bottom line fix is that if the bulb doesn't connect, you'll need to reset it--and the instructions for doing so are...something else: ""Start with your bulb off for at least 5 seconds. Turn on for 8 seconds Turn off for 2 seconds Turn on for 8 seconds Turn off for 2 seconds Turn on for 8 seconds Turn off for 2 seconds Turn on for 8 seconds Turn off for 2 seconds Turn on for 8 seconds Turn off for 2 seconds Turn on Bulb will flash on and off 3 times if it has been successfully reset."" {Whew!} It worked! The bulb reset and I was able to easily connect. Google should find a way to put these reset instructions on the help link that's in the Home app. Anyhow, off, on, dimming the bulb down to 2% of light are great features. Missing feature (or one I can't seem to find): setting a schedule to have the light turn off/on at preset times. There's a link in the Home app to buy more bulbs, but not one to set a schedule. The Mini is helpful too. I can find out the weather, a recipe, the weird stuff I regularly Google, and easily voice-control my other Google-connected or linked devices (e.g., Nest thermostat, ecobee). Both the bulb and Mini are great. I gave four stars because I still haven't figured out how to turn the volume down on the Mini outside of the app (where are the instructions!), not being able to setup a schedule, the bulb connection issue, and the need to go outside of the help section of the Home app and ""Google it"" in order to find a solution."
5.0,4 months ago,lowes.com,Easy setup and nice features,"I've been a fan and owner of that ""other"" smart home assistant for as long as it has been out. But some smart home upgrades I've made lately weren't so easy to pair - and the fact that she rarely understands what I say when I ask her questions, or can't find the answer - it has left me wanting more. In comes the Google Home Mini, with GE C-Life Smart Light. The setup for both items couldn't have been easier. Just download the Google Home app and the rest is very intuitive. I had both the mini and light set up in under 10 minutes. There was a slight snag on the Home Mini setup where it was telling me it couldn't link my account- try again. I tried again 3 times to no avail. Then I went back to the main screen and it showed up as linked. So if I could dock 1/2 star, I might do it for that. Otherwise I was very impressed- even more impressed when the Google Home app started picking up some of my other smart home devices on its own. I realized just how intelligent the Google Home system is in comparison to the ""other"" where you have to enable skills, tell it to locate devices which sometimes doesn't work, or even have to buy extra hubs and bridges to get things connected. The GE C-Life lightbulb is also wonderful. For those that don't have the means or opportunity to install smart switches, these are a great way to expand your smart home array. I'm going to buy more of them (actually already ordered), because I have some table lamps that can't be connected to smart switches, and I've never found a smart plug I liked. So the smart bulb is really a perfect solution. Once again, easy to setup with Google Home Mini, but I couldn't get my ""other"" device to find it at all - apparently it needs an extra hub to work with that one- ugh! The light output is decent and the color is on the warm/yellow side. The dimming option is also nice - I'll probably never use it, but it's nice that it's an option. Overall I'm happy and impressed with both products.Less"
1.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,"Used to be great, not after recent update","I purchased this item about a month or so ago from Best Buy. Previous this last week, I would give this item 4 stars. It played my owned music on Google Play Music, and would play playlists on YouTube. You couldn't ask for specific songs unless you pay for a YouTube Premium subscription, but you could cast from your YouTube phone app onto the mini. I didn't like that restriction, as the home hub has no restrictions like that, but considering the cost, I understand their marketing choice. They do want people to subscribe on their YouTube premium service after all. I could still cast to the mini in those specific instances where I wanted a specific song playing. The audio was good, with a good balanced sound across the spectrum. Overall, not bad considering the price. After the recent update, however, I would rate it 1 star. They added a new restriction through the YouTube and YouTube Music app in relation to this product. You can no longer cast to the mini from your phone or other device unless you subscribe to YouTube premium. I could live with their previous restrictions on non-subscribers. With their new restriction, however, I find this product worthless. There are times where my son wants a specific song in the bathroom, and I can no longer play him that song thanks to their update. I'm not gonna pay 10 bucks a month just for 1 or 2 songs a few times a week. I should still have the option to cast to the device in those sparse instances. If they don't remove the restriction, then I will likely switch to their competitor's products. The latest restriction additions actually drop their products value and usefulness to well below their main competitors. I recommend not buying, go with another product.Less"
5.0,4 months ago,lowes.com,Seamless Set Up & Responsive,"I've been using this set-up now for a week and I wanted to leave a feedback of my first impressions. 1. Set-up was a breeze with the use of the Smart Light and the app. Much easier than it ever was setting up our smart-plugs, so that was a huge plus. I love the fact that you can control the dimming action of the bulb and I will definitely be purchasing more of these for our home. 2. The Google Hub Mini is fantastic! Listen, we have two of those other hockey pucks from another company and the joke that A., as we will call her, spends the day drinking because she either can't understand or won't respond to any commands or randomly just signs off. The Google Hub Mini is extremely intuitive and you can speak to it in full sentences and it gives much better information. Again, set up was a breeze and a huge plus is that both of these items are now integrated into the Google Home app with our Nest security cameras and thermostat. The look of the Hub mini is also not as industrial and fits better into our home. We're still learning everything it can do, but so far, so good and it is highly responsive. Everything is in one spot together which is very nice. It's also learning our routines and adjusting as necessary, but in a good way in order to help. Not just taking over and doing random things like the other hockey pucks used to. Being able to speak through to the Hub Mini is fun and I've been able to broadcast and call into the house to check in to our daughter and the dogs. Remotely turning the light off and on is great and I don't have to just go into the Nest app, but can do it all from Google Home. I am very grateful for the opportunity to have received this and, although we had been fully operational using the A. items in our home, I am much more impressed with 'Hey Google' and am now a full fan. Highly recommend both of these products.Less"
5.0,3 months ago,lowes.com,Great Smart Home entry,"Whether you're looking to take your first step into adding smart home devices or looking to expand your existing smart home profile, this is a great choice for you. The kit contains two essential smart home items, an assistant speaker and a smart light bulb. The bulb itself is very nice, I love the control options you have with this bulb. It's great being able to dim light by my voice or phone, and set scenes to automatically adjust based on the time of day. The ability to control these through geofencing is awesome, I love being able to turn the lights on as I am pulling up to my house. The difference with this bulb is it is Bluetooth and not wi-fi, so you will need a Google Home speaker or GE hub nearby to control these. As for the Home Mini speaker, I'm pleasantly surprised with the output level. It can definitely fill a room with sound. However, the depth of sound is a bit lacking as one would expect for such a small speaker. The cost of these speakers I can see how nice it would be to have several located throughout the house. All in all, this is a great set if you are looking for an entry into smart home devices or looking to expand your existing smart home setup.Less"
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Great Tech for any Smart Home or Skynet Supporter,"Super handy gadget that once I saw it I had to have it. My wife and I live a minimal life so we opted to forego installing any light in our house other than what the sun decides to provide for us. No lamps, no lightbulbs, not even a bat signal type of flood light. This lifestyle isn't for everyone or anyone for that matter, including us so we picked up a Google Mini and a couple smart bulbs to place around the house. It can do a lot more than just turn on/off the lights by a simple command but that is the feature we utilize the most. One of the unexpected features I didn't realize it was capable of is how funny it is to be in one room and then you hear it answering questions nobody asked it or when you randomly walk past it and hear it whisper little sweet nothings from time to time. As soon as I realized it was listening to us and became self aware I decided to add a few more to the house so I could really speed up it's learning curve and utilize it's neural net processor. Now that I have multiple units sprawled across the house, I rarely ask it to do trivial things like turn on the lights for me. It's an insult to the tech. Now I consistently ask Google to broadcast flatulence across all devices. I can't begin to tell you how awesome it is to hear Google Rip Wet AF Alabama Mud Clumps in sync all over the house. It's like I'm engulfed in a Stank Symphony of sorts. It's not for everyone, especially my wife but I suggest you look up other reviews to see how others might utilize it's features but all in all I can't rave about it enough.Less"
5.0,3 months ago,lowes.com,Remember your WIFI password,"If this is your first experience with smart home gadgets, then this is an excellent starter kit. The light bulb included in this kit is a dimmable bulb that connects to the Google mini via bluetooth. It can all be controlled thru your smartphone. Download the App, connect with your WIFI and add the device (“light” or whatever you want to call it). Together, the two devices (the mini and the light bulb) will get you up and running to voice control a light in any part of your house. I set mine up in the guest bedroom. The most difficult part of the entire process for me was syncing my WIFI to the mini. The reason is because I actually forgot my WIFI password, but it didn’t stop me from expressing a few choice words about the Google mini starter kit. I have since asked Google for forgiveness. After I figured out the password… the setup and connection was so easy even a blonde could do it. (Pardon the old joke; I mean it is ultra easy to set-up) Following the instructions, getting the bulb connected was a snap; I gave the light bulb a name that I could actually remember (“light”), and was immediately able to tell Google mini to turn the light on and off. The best mini feature that I like the best, though, is the microphone on/off switch. Yes—privacy!!! One disappointment—If you want to control the light when you're away from home you can’t, unless you purchase a thingamajig that will hook-up to your WIFI. Something else to remember—if you add other devices, e.g., more light bulbs, smart switches, sensors etc., you might be better off going with a hub. If you’re looking to test the smart home waters, the Google Smart Light Starter Kit is a good way to go. It's extremely simple to set-up (providing you don’t forget your WIFI password); and the commands are straightforward: “Google, turn on the light.” “Google, dim the light.” “Google, how many ounces are in a pound?” “Google, play Neil Diamond music.” “Google, turn down the volume.” I’m confident you’ll be addicted to using it and wonder how you ever lived without it."
5.0,6 months ago,ebay.com,"Google Mini, a Must-Have!","The google mini is a great starter for someone not sure if they want to turn their home into a smart home. Start with a Google mini (or two! They are very affordable-watch for sales & auctions.) And add a smart light bulb or two. The system is fairly easy to set up, nothing to it at all, if you are tech savvy. I have several google minis in different rooms in my house now, with google assistant compatible smart bulbs in several of the same rooms. I can turn on my lights by voice command when I walk into a dark room and can turn the lights on and off when in bed. My google home is connected to my home security system (ADT) as well, so I can arm and disarm security and adjust my thermostat by voice. I can broadcast messages across the different rooms which have google minis. Even when I am not at home. I broadcast my message to my cell phone google assistant app away from home and my message will be heard from each google mini in the house. (Great way to communicate with kids that forget to charge their phones or chronically leave their phones on silent! Or maybe they were just telling me that and they were really just ignoring my calls. Well, can you hear me now? Yes, I know you can, because the whole heard what I just said!) The google mini is not the most powerful speaker out there, but it is perfect for home use. I have one in the bathroom to listen to while showering or getting ready for work. (Please note, they are not waterproof. Mine is mounted on the wall above my lightswitch. I have one in my bedroom to listen to news and use as an alarm clock. When doing housework, I will broadcast my playlist across ALL the google mini speakers so the music is in stereo and I can move from room to room and keep listening to my music. (The Ramones are my housework standard, but you could easily do an audio book or listen to a news program instead). I put two minis in my kitchen so I have my work music in stereo. Besides asking Google for random bits of information (what the weather is, is asked most frequently, and the reason I felt completely justified in calling it quits with the yard work this past weekend when google told me the ""feels-like"" temp was 105 degrees F!) Asking for commute times and locations of nearby commercial businesses is also helpful, as well as math equations and measurement conversions. I can keep track of my shopping lists as well. I notice that I am out of something so I say, ""hey google, add shampoo to the shopping list"" and it is on the list when I am ready to do my shopping. Before, I used to tell myself that I needed this, that and the other thing from the store and (goofy me) would expect to be able to remember all 30 or 40 items when I got there. It rarely worked out well. Ever walk into a store to buy one thing, just to buy 10 other items and forget to buy what you were supposed to get, forgetting the ONE thing you actually needed? I don't do that anymore! Google Assistant keeps track of my list for me. Do not forget to set up your routines. You are missing one of the best functions of the google mini if you don't set up morning and bedtime routines. I have a Google mini and smart bulbs in my bedroom. I tell google goodnight, my lights are turned off, security armed, thermostat adjusted, tomorrow's weather is given as well as my calendar items and reminders. Then google asks me what time do I need for my morning alarm. The good morning routine works the opposite. ""Hey google, good morning."" My bedroom and kitchen lights go on, today's weather given, commute estimates to work, my calendar and reminders are gone over and then the headlines from half a dozen news sources are gone over. All while I am still stretching and trying to figure out how many minutes do I have left before I ABSOLUTELY have to get out of bed! When the news gets to be just too awful to deal with in the morning and I decide to start my day with something that puts me in a good mood, I can either temporarily turn off the auto-news recitation and go straight to my favorite music. Nothing too relaxing or I'll never get out of bed. One current limitation is that routines can only be operated on one google mini. Consequently I do not have ""leaving home"" routines set up. Hopefully this limiation will be corrected in the future. All in all, my offspring and I are very happy with our google minis and are finding new uses for them all the time. We can't wait to see what new features will become available next and what new compatible products we can try. (I have a couple of smart plugs for outlets so I have the means to google-fy some electronics that are not actually google assistant compatible. Plug an item in the google compatible outlet adapter and leave the device in on mode. You control the on-off power of this item by voice controlling the on-off power of the outlet it's plugged into. Not sure what I will google-fy next, but I can't wait to try it!"
4.0,3 months ago,lowes.com,Great product bundle for the price,"Pros: The Google Hub offers good sound quality and is fairly easy to set up. The Philips Smart Light is excellent and also fairly easy to set up. You can control the light by voice and even change it brightness, which is the feature I like the most. The combination price for this set is unbeatable. Cons: Setup for the smart hub had an initial hiccup, but then worked flawlessly. Note I already had a Google Home account before adding this new device. Set up for the Smart Light failed the first 2 times, then worked on the third attempt. It's hard to figure out, or find out, exactly what th Smart Hube can do since there is no master list of commands for it. For example, you can link your Spotify account to the Google Home account and play songs from Spotify, but there is no way to play any of your self created Spotify playlists! It took a whole lot of internet searching to discover that. Still can't find how to make a schedule for the Smart Light. Recommendations: This is a great starter package for home automation. The basic Google Hub does virtually everything you will need a smart speaker to do. The Smart Light was perfect. On / off/ and brightness control. For the price this is one of the best starter kits on the market.Less"
4.0,4 months ago,lowes.com,Does The Job,"This smart speaker does the job. Set up of the home mini was pretty easy. Plug it in, download the home app, pretty self explanatory. The quality of sound is good for most functions. However, if you want to use this to stream music then you should probably go with a different device. I only knocked off one star for this because most people probably know not to expect amazing sound quality from this small speaker. The C Life by GE smart bulb was slightly harder only because I was unaware at first that if you are using the Google Home app to control the light that you SHOULD NOT set up the light through ANY OTHER APPS. If you do this, then you will painfully have to go through a series of turning the light on for 8 seconds and off for two and on for 8 and blah blah blah in order to factory reset the light so you can then set it up through the Google Home app. TRUST ME, just begin with whatever app you will be using and do not set it up under multiple apps. Otherwise, the light works well, and Google Home and the mini control the light as they should. If you are looking to start a smart home with a small (pretty easy to hide and fit into most decor) assistant and smart light then this should do the trick.Less"
5.0,3 months ago,lowes.com,My First Hub Product - Nice!,"Google Smart Light Start Kit I am new to hub managed technology and this is my first item. The box comes complete with a GE dimming smart bulb, a Google Hub, and a simple “quick start instructions” which I followed even though there was another set of instructions inside the box containing the hub. Set up was simple: 1 Plug in the hub to a wall socket. 2 Install the bulb in a lamp in the same room. 3 Download the Google Home Ap to a Smartphone. 4 Turn the light on. 5 Follow the setup instructions on the Smartphone. I had to do an update of the hub which took about 4 minutes. During this time the light flashed a few times. The hub will do a lot more than just turn the light on and off. Since it is connected to my home internet, it will answer many questions. I will not delve into the additional capabilities here. Once set up, I said “hey Google, turn the light off” and it did. When I told Google to turn it on again, it returned to the same brightness that it was when I shut it off. I told it to turn on to the brightest and then said “hey Google, dim the light”. I did that repeatedly and on the 7th command it turned the bulb off. Regarding the hub itself, you can touch the sides to increase or decrease volume. There is also a slide switch that will disable the microphone. The ap also has many features and opportunities to link other smart items in your home to the hub such as Dish TV and smart thermostats. The ap includes a microphone feature that allows you to speak to the phone as if it were the hub. This is set up in a large room upstairs and will be very convenient as the lights that I use are not near the doorway. This is a nice entry level hub product to get you hooked on connecting everything in your house to it.Less"
5.0,4 months ago,lowes.com,Almost too powerful to be called Mini,"My family started using the Google Smart Light Starter Kit Bridge Home Automation Hub, which includes a Google Home Mini and a GE c-life light bulb just a couple of days ago and use the items with a Google Nest Hub Max that we already had. Set up could not have been easier. All we had to do was exchange a previous light bulb with the GE c-life light bulb, plug in the Google Home Mini in the same room and open up the Google Home app on a smart phone or tablet. Since we already had a Google Nest Hub Max, most of the setup was automatic. In just a few minutes, we were able to start using the Mini just as we have been doing with the Max. You can say, “Hey Google, turn on the light” or “dim the light” or “turn off the light,” etc. You can also ask it to tell you the weather, what is on your calendar for the day, to play music, what the stock market is doing, and on and on. If you are cooking dinner and find you ran out of salt, you can ask it to add salt to your shopping list. If you have a Nest thermostat, are cold, and want the house warmed, you can ask it to turn up the thermostat to the desired temperature. The Google Home Mini is attractive on our living room end table and not an eye sore to see. The sound quality is outstanding for the size of speaker and it picks up your voice even when calling to it from another room. Now that my family has tested this Mini out, we plan to buy one for several rooms of the house along with smart lights and plugs.Less"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,4.5-star Google Home mini w/about 4-star LED bulbs,"PROs: - If you are having trouble setting up the Google Home Mini, the bulbs thankfully still function as regular LED bulbs upon initial power-up--no flashing, blinking, blanking or waiting for an app or voice assistant to pair - Though the Mini is the draw here, there is a 'C by GE' app that still allows Bluetooth-distance remote control for power, brightness, schedule/timer setting, and one-touch ""scene"" settings (Good morning, I'm home, Party, etc.) - The color temperature is not tunable (for that, you would need the C-Sleep bulbs), but the 2700K preset has a pretty comfortable incandescent bulb-like hue that is reasonably conservative and therefore versatile for typical duty - With the Google Home Mini, setup and integration into a fledgling (or even more extensive) home network is pretty much instantaneous and you get all the hands-free voice activation you could want for power, scheduling, brightness levels, and out-of-the-home control - Take the bulbs out of the equation, and you have a smart speaker which handles natural language pretty well providing all the personal voice assistance and trappings of a Google-enabled device you could possibly want (okay, except for maybe a screen) - Once you have the Google Home app on the go, you can control all the lights via the Home app and the Mini from anywhere you have a network connection--nice for adjustments while on the road - Voice Match was actually an intriguing feature; you can set up the Mini to recognize different voices in your household and then Google will respond accordingly--for example, not including your 9 year-old's music requests in your music search/playback history CONs: - This is truly a ""mini"" smart-home starter kit--with no smart outlets or other sensors, what you get are the bulbs for about a $5 premium over the full-priced Google Home Mini...that's a decent value if you were paying full price for the Mini to begin with, but a harder sell with the Mini at a discount because the lights are just decent smart bulbs in and of themselves (there are certainly better and more capable bulbs out there) - The smart speaker and streaming media playback on the Mini tends to work best with a Youtube and/or Google Play subscription--I have neither, and would often ask Google to play me some ""X"" only be to be told I'd need a subscription for THAT particular band, song, album, etc...but here was a streaming radio station that probably offered something similar. I get it, you don't get something for nothing, and if you're fine with commercials in your Spotify or just whatever Pandora serves up free you'll likely be fine, just be aware that maximum responsiveness to your musical whims is probably going to come with an extra price tag! - Though the bulbs are set at a pretty comfortable color temperature, you cannot change the ""color"" of white for this set--if you are looking for daylight or more blueish hues (or even colors), you need to look elsewhere, or just get the Mini by its lonesome and grab a different set of smart bulbs - The bulbs are not WIFI enabled--they are Bluetooth, which means at least one needs to be within 40-50 unobstructed feet of the Mini, and the other bulb at least the same to its mate (if they are not in the same general area). This somewhat limits how deeply you can dip your toe in the smart-home waters--if you want to put a bulb out in the entryway and the other on the back porch, the Mini needs to placed such that it can reach both bulbs (or at least one which then daisy-chains to the other) - If you mess up during the bulbs setup, or just need to start over, there is an 11-step factory reset procedure that alternates between on/off cycles that vary from 2 seconds to 5-10 seconds each. I was able to get the bulbs reset multiple times while switching between the 'C by GE' app control, and using the Google Home Mini, I sometimes needed 3-5 extra on/off cycles to finally get the reset confirmation blinks in the bulbs Summary review: I can see why these are sold together as a starter kit...but the truth is, you don't NEED the Mini to use/configure the LED bulbs...any Bluetooth-enabled device and the C by GE app can provide the same sort of control; at least within Bluetooth connectivity distances. So I approached this set from the perspective that it's an easy way to see what sorts of things are POSSIBLE if I had a smart home centered around something like the Mini. In that sense, this starter kit definitely gets things going, especially if you use the bulbs in a pronounced location like a dark basement or entryway where you'd love to be able to control the lights with your voice. But otherwise, the draw here is really the Mini itself. It does so much more than just control THESE particular bulbs, or even control smart appliances/objects in general. With constant voice assistant capabilities, you'll be surprised how often you end up saying ""Okay Google""...and then querying the ""verbal Internet"" for answers to all things serious (how can I tell if I'm having a heart attack) and mundane (what's the weather going to be like tomorrow?). As a smart speaker...well, it's a smart object that has a speaker built in, and you'd be surprised how loud it can get, but the fidelity is only okay. With a number of these dotted around the house, I think they would make great ""ambience"" speakers all streaming the same soundtrack to your life (or maybe even something different from speaker to speaker), but I wouldn't want to do any critical or even loud party listening as the ""oomph"" just isn't there...and I did notice just a hint of distortion start to creep in at higher playback volumes. So is this set for you...honestly, I would think the answer comes down to the value proposition. If you were prepared to pay nearly full price for a Google Home Mini anyway (or if you can snag this starter set on a sale), I think it's a no-brainer. You get everything you were going to get from the Mini anyway, and you can set some home lighting automation or program some cool effects like ""Okay Google, get ready for the movies"" and your voice will magically activate a scene (that you've pre-programmed of course) that lowers the bulb's brightness to a home theater-friendly level. The bulbs themselves will work without the Mini so if you had other designs on where the Mini was going to go or how it was going to be used, it's almost like you can get two unrelated products nearly for the price of one. But if you're budget conscious and can snag the Mini on a deal in and of itself, there are much more flexible and capable smart bulbs out there to play with...cautiously recommended."

I couldn't be more pleased. This starter kit was so simple to set up, right out of the box. I plugged in the Google Assistant, screwed in the bulb, turned on the light switch, and installed the Google Home app to my Samsung cellphone. It recognized my device instantly and I completed the set up instructions from my cellphone. (I did not have to install the C by GE app) I named it as ""Living Room"" so Google could determine which light I wanted to turn on or off. I have since purchased 2 more of these kits (as Christmas gifts), 2 more Google assistants for other areas in my home, and more bulbs. I have named the other rooms as ""Office"" and ""Master Bedroom"". I just say ""Hey Google....Turn on (or off) the Living Room light"" and the closest Google assistant will respond to my command. In the Google Home app, I have set up different commands in the ""Routines"" setting so when I'm not at home, I can still turn on lights from my cellphone. Aside from the light features, the Google Assistant is really awesome. I will ask it questions and it responds with the answers. It will give me the weather reports, the temperature, the news, etc. It will even tell me a joke or play music. Google has been around for several years. It has ""learned"" answers to many things. That's why people ""Google it"" if they need to know an answer. Now I can just verbally ask Google and don't need to get on my computer. I love this new lifestyle.Less"

I have mine forward to my Sony SRS-ZR7 speakers which are network connected. Works like a charm. The non-mini google home costs substantially more and doesn't sound much better. I use my google home mini speakers in almost every room of my home. They control my smart lights (hue), my thermostat (nest), my home automation devices (samsung smarthings) which controls things like my motions sensors and my locks. I also control my home theater system through my logitech harmony hub. Just sit down and tell my system what movie to play. It turns down the lights and starts up my entertainment system and begins the movie requested. Everything begins and ends with this device. Ask it what time it is, what the weather is, or any common question you'd ask google.com.Less"
2.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Good idea, poor execution","Disclaimer - I was given this product in return for my fair and honest review. TL;DR version - this would be okay for apartment dwellers, but the Google Smart Light Starter Kit featuring the C-Life by GE bulb is otherwise a 4-star smart speaker with tons of features and smarts paired with a ""smart"" lightbulb that isn't exactly smart. Also, a bad value for its regular price, but the ""smart bulbs"" themselves are also a bad value compared to other superior options for around their same price point. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Google Smart Light Starter Kit will always look enticing to the unknowing consumer, because who doesn't like the idea of including a smart lightbulb (in this case, C-Life by GE) with a Google Home Mini smart speaker for a decent overall price compared to buying the speaker and a smart bulb by themselves? Looks can be deceiving. I'm not going to talk much about the Google Home Mini (referred to as a GHM from here on out), because if you're reading this, chances are that you know it's a small smart speaker device that you can get answers to your questions from and control most home automation devices from nearly every manufacturer with. Unlike non-Google brand Google Assistant speakers, you can also use it with the FREE Google Voice VoIP phone service - just like with its big brothers, the Google Home and the Google Home Max - to make outgoing phone calls with terrific audio quality (but not to receive incoming calls or contact emergency services). With more and more abilities being added to Google Assistant, you can use it to order food, electronics, clothing, and more though various retailers that have embraced the service. It also functions as a Chromecast Audio receiver and can control your Chromecast-equipped TV, speakers, or your Android TV-based smart TV. If the next version of the GHM were to add an audio output, the GHM is the perfect small smart speaker in my book. But enough about that, because there are tons of reviews and articles about the GHM and how awesome it is. What I am going to talk about is the the other part of the package package. A decent enough smart speaker that I would give 4 stars to in its current iteration is brought down by what GE passes off as a ""smart"" bulb. For me, there's not enough of a feature set here to justify calling it smart. While you can turn the bulb on and off and set its brightness via the Google Home app or through Google Assistant, that's about it for the bulb's ""smarts"". It also uses a Bluetooth connection that requires the GHM that comes in the package; powering down the GHM it's paired to effectively makes the smart bulb the equivalent of a cheap LED bulb you'd pick up in your local hardware store, and Bluetooth's limited range compared to WiFi means the GHM and the bulb need to be placed in close proximity with each other. Metallic light fixtures, water pipes, HVAC ducting, and electrical wiring affect the usable range distance between the GHM and the bulb. A setup note for the C-Life bulb states that if you use multiple bulbs, they can create a mesh network, but all bulbs need to be placed within 40 feet of each other. The good about this kit is it's at least extremely easy to set up. You set up the GHM inside the Google Home app on your Android device (Kit Kat or later with a Bluetooth 4.0LE capability) or iOS (iPhone 5, iPod Touch 5, iPad 4rd Gen, or iPad Mini 2 or later device running iOS 10 or later), and then you're prompted by the Google Home app to pair the C by GE bulb to the GHM. Sorry PC and Mac users, you need a portable device to get this going. I did try to pair the bulb with other Google Assistant smart speakers I have that aren't the GHM in the package via the Google Home app (I have 3 different brands, all with Bluetooth 4 connectivity). None of the other speakers were able to discover up the C-Life lightbulb, which means to use C-Life lightbulbs with Google Assistant, you pretty much need a GHM or other Google-branded smart speaker. If you're looking at the ""Made for Google"" C-Life or C-Sleep bulbs and you have a non-Google brand Google Assistant speaker, it's just not going to work. The good news here, at least, is that you can control the bulb away from home as long as it maintains a connection with the GHM. My GHM and C-Life are located about 15 feet apart and the two devices have lost connection with each other a few times, but nothing a quick power cycle can't fix (in each case, it was always resetting the bulb). While the lightbulb can pair with the C by GE app for iPhone and Android, this also gives you a basic Bluetooth-connected remote controlled lightbulb and the inability to control it away from home. Because of this, I highly recommend that you stay completely away from GE's app when it comes to this bulb, because you will have issues getting it to work with the GHM if you have previously paired it with the C by GE app. (I did try this by the way; it's a major pain to unpair a C-Life bulb from any device because of the strangest on-off cycling pattern you need to follow to factory reset it.) Also, the bulbs can only pair with ONE device, be it a GHM or a phone. Once paired with a GHM, however, you can use multiple devices with the Google Home app installed to control the bulb; you'll just need to do the ""Invite"" thing inside of the Google Home app so people on other Google accounts can use the C-Life bulb and all of the other smart devices you have under Google Home's control. The C by GE app also warns you that you should really pair the C-Life bulb with the GHM and not the app. (I ignored this warning in the name of science.) Like I said, a decent 4-star speaker is brought down by a lightbulb pretending that it's smart. While I might recommend this for apartment dwellers, I highly recommend that you look into other ways of doing smart lighting in your home or apartment. WiFi-connected smart bulbs from other manufacturers are inexpensive and far more flexible. Lighting systems based on Z-Wave, ZigBee, Wink, and other protocols have greater range than the Bluetooth-connected C by GE lightbulbs. Finally, the GHM and other Google Assistant smart speakers can be had on the cheap. Now if you can find the Smart Light Starter Kit for the same price as a GHM by itself, then go for it since you'd get a free remote-controlled lightbulb."
2.0,3 months ago,lowes.com,Encountered Problems,"I will start out the review by stating that I received a defective product. I tried to get this remedied but so far have not received a response. So this review is based on the product being defective but I hope to come back and edit it if a replacement is ever received. Smart Bulb - Right off the bat, the smart bulb was defective. When trying to connect it to the Google Home app, it started to setup, flashed several times like it said it would, then I got an error in the app and it never saw the light bulb again. The bulb still turns on and off, but the app will not detect it. I also noticed that the base of the bulb is very hot. I don't know if that is normal or not. But regardless, the bulb just works as a standard bulb and nothing else. Google Mini - So the Google Mini is the competitive product to the Amazon Echo Dot. They pretty much work the same by giving them voice commands, and getting information or services. Music requests are streamed from YouTube Music primarily but a handful of others are offered. They do include commercials unless you pay a subscription service. Things like setting alarms are really easy and work well. However if you wish to make somewhat of a complex alarm request like ""weekdays only, no federal holidays"", it can get confused as to what you are asking for. Sometimes it helps ask for a basic alarm and provide no details. Then let it ask you what details it needs. The Mini can be made part of a speaker group with other Google devices which is a nice feature to stream music through multiple rooms in your house. The sound quality is average. It's not meant to rival a stereo, but it's good for music while doing other work. One down side is that you cannot change the name of the device to activate it. This is where Amazon's device has the upper hand because it's more natural to say ""Alexa"" than it is to say ""Hey Google"" or ""OK Google"". So overall, it's not great. The Mini is good, probably not as good as an Echo Dot which we also have in the house. And the bulb was defective, so yeah not much to say."

IMHO GE needs to catch up with Philips hue lighting & offer a broader selection of lightning option at reasonable prices. Lucky to find a great set of smart lights that have the white/color ambience lights without the over priced Philips hue and bridge you need to make them work. I've gotten almost good at setting them up & saying ""hey Google, turn on lights in kitchen or change bathroom lights to light blue"" or having Google mini set alarms, timers,etc, I'm still discovering the many ways Google minis can make life a little easier. BTW Google mini has great speaker sound not as good as Bose jbl but still quite good. I find Google mini much easier for me to work with than Alexa but that's just me. Bought a small stand that holds mini up & can be rotated....better to hear mini & better for mini to respond to my voice. never thought I would use it but as days get shorter & I need lights but my hands are full,Mini is ready to turn on those lights. no I don't have smart thermostat, or those other items. right now smart lighting is a big help if you like dim lights mini will do that for you.

3.0,3 months ago,lowes.com,"Speaker is great, bulb not so much","First, the initial setup of the google home mini with an iPhone was a nightmare. Turns out there is a known issue between iOS 13 and Google Home (can't connect to WiFi error). After two weeks of waiting for this to be resolved, I finally gave up and got my brother to come over and set it up using his android phone. Once set up I was able to add my ecobee thermostats and a few other devices. It took a few tries to get the bulb recognized, but now that it's setup I'm able to control the light. There is one major drawback with these type of bulbs compared to the smart switches I typically use, and that is my wife. She insists on turning the lights off at the switch, which makes the bulb pretty useless for me. Overall I find the voice recognition of the mini a lot better than the Echo I have, but it's been hard to adjust to the different commands that are available with the mini compared to the Echo. You can't really have both in the house, it's too confusing. Not sure I'm ready to switch to the mini, as I really like the music options and sound quality of the Echo. I would recommend this to someone who doesn't have any smart devices yet, and to stick with a single brand.Less"
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,"For the low cost, why not have one?","I have no real need for a voice-activated assistant in my house. But for $30 I figured it might be fun to have one around. There are countless reviews of Google Assistant, Alexa, and Siri out there, so I won't get into the pros and cons of each. But suffice it to say, I'm more invested into the Google ecosystem than the others. Also I value Google's better AI and its better understanding of natural language above all other considerations. However if you're already knee-deep in Amazon services, then Alexa should be a better choice. But I digress. While the true differentiator in this category is the software, I'll focus on the hardware. The hardware design is very clean. A series of lights flashing through the speaker provides visual feedback. There are no physical buttons, but volume can be adjusted by tapping the device on the left and right sides. All other settings are controlled by an app. The sound quality is adequate. But when it comes to music, it's probably best suited for background listening. There are other Google-branded devices that offer better sound quality and features. But the main advantage of the Google Mini Home is that it's small, cute, unobtrusive, and inexpensive. There are a few different colors to choose from. The initial setup was relatively easy as the app walks you through the process. It does require ""AP isolation"" on your router to be disabled, and if it isn't the setup process cannot be completed. AP isolation may not be possible to adjust on some routers especially low-end ones. If it's not possible then you're out of luck. At that point you either need to return the Google Home Mini or upgrade your router. Also a Google account is required to activate the speaker. The trigger phrase to wake Google Assistant is ""Ok Google"" or ""Hey Google""--phrases that don't exactly roll off the tip of your tongue compared to the competition. Currently there is no way to change the trigger phrase. This is a minor but noticeable deficiency. But I suppose that's the case with all voice assistants. So your dream of pretending to be Captain Picard barking out ""Computer"" will have to wait for another day."

5.0,4 months ago,lowes.com,A Little Something To Make Life Easier,"This comes with two items: a Google Home Mini and a GE C-Life smart bulb. The Google Home Mini is a smart speaker. You can use this in an endless number of ways. As this is a Google product, any questions you ask will be answered from the Google search engine. It is kind of like a talking encyclopedia. You can ask the weather, set alarms for weekdays only for work and have it save reminders so you won’t forget important dates, etc. I use mine to remind me when to pay my bills so I don’t miss any payments. The list of things it can do is endless, from waking you up in the morning - to turning the lights on for you, to playing your favorite songs in the afternoon - to looking up recipes for your dinner, to turning on your TV, to turning the lights off for bedtime. Setup for the Mini is simple. Download the Google Home app, plug in your Mini, start the app and add a device. Follow the simple instructs and you are ready to go. The GE C-Life bulb is a smart bulb. It is a little less expensive than some of the other ones out there. It will replace a standard 60-watt bulb and is rated to last up to 20 years. Set up for this is very easy. Since you already have the Google Home app, simply start the app and add a device. It will find the bulb in the room and you just follow the instructions. Once you have this set up, you can use the Google Home Mini to turn the light off, on and even dim it. Simply say “Hey Google, turn off (what you named the bulb)” and it will turn off. This a very inexpensive way to start setting up a smart home and see if you really like it. I love it and building up to a smart home becomes addictive. I have lights in every room now and just wish I had realized there were these cheaper GE lights that work with Google before I bought so many of the other brand.Less"

Of course you don't need the mini to use the bulb, it also works with the Google Assistant on your phone. For some reason, I was not able to get the bulb to connect to the “C by GE” app on my phone, but it’s not a huge deal, dimming and off/on functions all work with voice control or through the Google Home app. Overall, this package is an easy way to get into home automation and would make a great gift!Less"
2.0,3 months ago,lowes.com,"Google Home Mini good, GE C-light bad","This was not my first GH mini. I like the design, function and app associated with it. Beats Alexa hands down on intelligence and voice recognition. The GE C-light on the other hand, not so good - unless this is somehow a GH defect. I set up the GH mini first, then tried to pair the GE C-light. The C-light was recognized and seen by GH app. The light went through the motions of setting up in GH app. Then, at the last step, it failed. I tried to restart the process, but now the light was not being 'seen' by the GH app. So, I went through the cumbersome process of resetting the GE light, found here: https://support.cbyge.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015805191-How-To-Factory-Reset-Your-C-by-GE-Smart-Bulbs After reset, the light over again showed up in GH app. Same result as first setup. So, to give it a fair shake, I uninstalled and reinstalled the GH app, and reset the light a second time. Same result, except this time it was more confusing, because 2 C-light IDs showed up in the GH app. One went through the same process, and same result. The other was not responding, so it must have somehow been a previous ID before reset, which is strange to me. The C-LIGHT light has a MAC ID for Ethernet/WiFi printed on it, and neither ID resembled it in any way. There is a separate C-light app that links to a .cn (Chinese) website for registration. I did not try the C-light app, because I don't need another app, and a feature on the GE website and this ""home automation"" package, is that it pairs directly with GH app, no separate app or hub needed. Bad rebranded, outsourced design by GE and unfortunate that Google got themselves connected with it (pun intended). I think it's a bad idea anyway. Smart plugs are more versatile. Unfortunate for all involved, and a waste of my time. Now, it's just a plain old LED bulb with a GH mini included. I instead need a smart plug to control this light.Less"

During the set up process it recognized the bulb by flashing it three times and then the process failed without any explanation. This is a definite weak spot in the Google Home app. It only gives the most general information when even the slightest of an arrow pointing to where the problem is would be helpful instead of having to work through a series of reboot processes until the remedy is found. The third process and 30 minutes later for me. I rebooted the Home Mini and restarted the Home app per the web troubleshooting instructions without success.. I then delved deeper into the troubleshooting and found out how to factory reset the bulb by a process of turning it on for 8 seconds after turning it off for 2 seconds and doing this six times. The process feels silly but it worked and then I was able to add the bulb to my Google Home app and the Mini has voice control over it.

3.0,3 months ago,lowes.com,Minimum Mini,"Frankly, this was a disappointment for me. The bulb has to be in a socket which is left ""ON"" permanently. You give up the use of an actual switch. Okay for an attic, I suppose, but a real pain for most lamps. Even though the bulb is a LED and is extremely electrically efficient compared to a traditional filament or CFL bulb, some of that efficiency is wasted because there is a trickle of power required to operate the circuitry that allows the linking of bulb and hub. The bulb is also only 760 lumens - less than a traditional 60 watt bulb, which also limits its application. I'd have felt differently if the kit had included a much higher output and/or reflector-style spotlight bulb. A true starter kit, in my opinion would be a smart switch as a replacement wall switch - it would put the control where it belongs. This falls into a novelty category - not particularly useful, but fun to have if only for music and news/information on demand. On a positive note, the unit is unobtrusive and has a modern ""polished"" look.Less"
5.0,a year ago,lowes.com,A Very Good Smart Home & Search Device,"As part of my fairly complete suite of Google Home devices, the Home Mini serves quite well, in my opinion, for several personal assistant-like and smart home functions. That is, sound reproduction is still not up to its major competitor's ability. I also find trying to link several [Google] Home devices to replay or stream the same input is cumbersome, at best. On the other hand, would be easier to link to my personal music library, when loaded to Google Drive, a major obstacle now with the competitor eliminating ability to store a library with them. Like all of the Google Home family devices I have tested, I find that the functionality as a smart home controller/input device is flawless, and in fact seems much more time-responsive than the prevalent competing devices, which lately seem to be lagging between command and smart device actuation. With few exceptions, almost all of the smart devices installed can be controlled by either system, which does provide me with redundancy.. One exception is a bundled ""GE"" smart light bulb, that I can only control via Google, unless I want to write an IFTTT {as I understand it} routine for the other system. One stand-out is its interaction with my smart thermostat, which is much more intuitive. Other than the mobile app, it is the only means of which I'm aware for controlling the Chromecast device, to include voice commands for those services which the Chromecast is enabled. (See my Chromecast review for more). Moreover, the smaller size of the Home Mini allows its placement in locations where neither the full-sized 'normal' Home, nor obviously the huge Google Max.would fit. To me, the one other lack with regard to playing music, is that the Google Home devices cannot be wire-connected to either a powered speaker set or full audio system, having to link via Bluetooth. While for many this is preferable anyway, I personally am not a fan of creating a large paired set of devices to have access to a playback means. Also, I would think, but do not know for sure, that there will be even further audio spectrum clipping due to bandwidth limitations. Oh, and one other function where it excels, is obviously direct access to Google Search and stored data functions. There is not as extensive a skills library, and the one entertainment app I've used seems a bit 'hokey' - the trivia game ""show"". Again, it is a very capable device and system, and I generally like it. For someone [else] who is not a ""Prime"" member, it is a definite alternative to the major competitor's smaller version, and in a home running both systems, it serves as both a niche and as an alternative system quite well. [One niche example is that I have only Google Home devices (a 'Mni' & light bulbs) in my basement where I no longer entertain. I could later add a Bluetooth adapter, should I decide I wanted to stream music via the Google device there.] In short, once again, a recommended and quite capable system that just would not be a total solution for me, but could well be for others."

When I say ""installed"", I mean: You plug it in and look at your app to set up that light/device. It is that simple! Google has made it simple enough that it is self expiatory once you open the app. Upper left corner it asks if you want to set up the smart devices you just turned on or the light bulb you just screwed into the lamp. Here we are 3-4 days after receiving the automation hub and I have acquired 6 light bulbs (cost about $12-$13 each) I am loving the convenience it provides! For example, you are arriving home later than expected and you don't want the home to appear empty so you go into your Google Home app and turn on whatever lights you would like - you can even have the automaton hub play music for you at whatever volume you would like. How about, there is a light that is crammed in the corner and hard to reach? Another problem solved by a smart light. It coordinated very well with the Google Nest Hub Max that I have. No conflicts at all. So overall, the automation hub was simple and functioning perfectly.

4.0,a year ago,lowes.com,Bundled Google-Home dedicated Smart Bulbd with Min,"I am not going to repeat my reviews or ""Mini""-related evaluations already posted. In short, the Google Mini is a fully functional smart home device that really only lacks in audio capability, and other limitations related to available pre-programmed skill sets, noted elsewhere. It's good, but doesn't really improve on its competitor, except as a direct link to search functions. There it does excel. The C by GE smart bulb is a fully functional smart bulb, which is can be dimmed [solely] via either the App or a Google Home device command. Within that limitation, it functions exceedingly well. A nominal 60W-incandescent bulb equivalent - the bulb's box and online give different output levels,in same general range - it yields roughly 800 lumens. This bundled bulb is slightly warm, though apparently is also available as a Daylight (colder, more blue) variation. One absolute major advantage to LED bulbs that can be dimmed, even over CFLs, is that the dimmed percentage is directly proportionate to the current drawn, at least to a minimum threshold (I'm guessing around 5%). That is, down to whatever the 'trigger threshold is, the power consumption drops by the same amount, so if set to 10% brightness, it only uses 1/10th of the power as full brightness. At a rated 9.5 W consumption, dimmed to 10%, the bulb would only draw .0.95 Watt, or 1 kWh every 1050 hours. Obviously an extreme example, but using at short intervals at reduced %-age,m will significantly reduce operating cost, and at least in theory, should increase the life-span of the bulb. For example, installed in my laundry room, during daytime I only run at 15-20% to augment daylight, and even after dark, for that limited space, find 50% usually sufficient. However, if one already has Google Home devices, this bundle is redundant, unless the intent is to expand the 'network' of Home devices to another, non-contiguous space, for example to a garage or work-shed in range of one's router or WiFi mesh. Otherwise, one should simply buy the bulb(s) separately. Note that there are other brands of bulbs that available that are also controllable without a 'hub', by either Google Home and/or the main competitor system devices."

As I was setting it up, it recognized that I had a google nest hub in the house and immediately connected to it. With this connection, it instantly recognized my voice. On turning on the light, I asked her - female voice - to dim the light. The light was dimmed. I tried telling her to dim until I said stop, but she did not understand that, so I had to keep telling her to dim the light until I got the light to the brightness I wanted. This would be something for AI folks to work on. She also plays music, gives the weather, tells time and is an excellent alarm device. I told her to turn the light on at 4 pm and she did so. However, I could not get her to turn the light on and off at different times of the day with one command. I was hoping to set her up to turn on and off while we were away on vacation, but that does not work. Something else for AI folks to work on. I would have given this five stars if the device had worked in the areas mentioned above.

With that being said, if you’re not wanting to spend an exorbitant amount of money on high-end smart bulbs but do want to have a good LED lightbulb with basic smart lighting capabilities, than this kit is a great start. What makes this kit great is the included personal assistant speaker. After connecting it to the internet, you can make simple commands or ask any question and the speaker uses Google to answer your question or execute your command. If you haven’t adventured into the world of using a personal assistant, even on your phone, having a stand along speaker and connected light bulb is a good way to become familiar with this technology. This best part about using Google instead of the other available smart assistants (Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Samsung’s Bixby, and Microsoft’s Cortana) is its ability to understand “naturally” spoken sentences. This means you don’t have to memorize any specific commands; you can simply say, “Hey Google, can you turn on the dining room light?” Also, the Google Home app is widely compatible with many brands on the market. So, if you’re thinking of getting one of those automated robot vacuums, you’ll easily be able to pair them and use your voice to start vacuuming. Overall, the Google personal assistant speaker is a very useful device. The included LED bulb is a basic smart bulb with dimming capabilities. There are other GE C-Life bulbs that also offer white color temperature variations, such as bright white, cool white, and warm light, but this kit includes the standard warm color bulb. In comparison to other warm lightbulbs, this GE bulb does emit a good bright warm color. Regarding its “smart” capabilities, it’s definitely meant to work mainly with the included Google Home Mini speaker. Unlike other smart bulbs, which are connected directly to the internet using Wi-Fi, this bulb needs the speaker to stay connected. The bulb and speaker communicate using Bluetooth. So, if the speaker is too far away (beyond 40 feet) or powered off, than the bulb can’t be controlled over the internet. Meaning, you can’t switch the bulb on or off either through the Google Home app or by giving a command to the speaker. These limitations may be a hinderance to someone looking to setup a complex smart home lighting system, but to someone looking for basic automation, these bulbs accomplish the task. Overall, the kit was very easy to setup and use. The included hardware (speaker and bulb) is made well is good quality."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,I didnt think i would like it as much as i did,"i was initially against the google home / alexis stuff but once i got one for my bedroom (along with smart lights), now I love these things. I have one in my bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, living room, office, and both kids rooms. Hooked up spotify to listen to music through this. I put the smart lights in the main living areas and these controls them all. A great feature is the broadcast message feature. If dinner is done, I can broadcast a message to all rooms ""dinner is done"" and everyone in the house hears it. Another good feature is that I can call one mini hub from another. I haven't mastered this yet because sometimes it tries to call one of my contacts instead. Actually that literally would be my only complaint. if I said call 'nates room speaker', and it decides to call a person from my contacts, I cant cancel in time... it will ring my contact before i get a chance to say ""ok google hang up"". a solution would be an option where it repeats your call request and wants a yes /no reply... i.e., hub will confirm like this: ""call nates room speaker? say yes if this is correct"". I actually should take a star away for that one issue because I don't call hub to hub anymore just because of that - but everything else is so good I will just leave it and figure out on my own what i can do to not call contacts.Less"
3.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,It's just... ok.,"I have a regular Google Home, and several minis, as well as an Echo Dot and an Alexa enabled lamp. My Google Home works ok although it seems like Google pushes a lot of updates which can cause issues quite often. Voice control commands will sometimes stop working and then start again several days later. Also my smart devices will sometimes randomly disconnect causing me to have to factory reset my Google Home to reconnect them. The sound quality is not as great as I was hoping. After getting my Google Home, I decided to try out the Echo Dot and was actually quite impressed by the quality of it, the lights, and the sound quality. It seems to hear me a lot better, and Alexa voice controls are a lot better. Also, my devices never disconnect. I've since then started using my Echo Dot for my smart home controls and my Google Home for just listening to Spotify. I love the Alexa app. It is far more intuitive, looks better, and I love the Alexa skills. If you want just simple smart home control, go with Google Home. If you want sound quality, games, and a device to have fun with, go with Alexa.Less"
4.0,a year ago,lowes.com,A very affordable smart speaker with a light bulb,"The technology to control lightbulbs and other devices in a binary way (on/off) has been around for decades, so making it next-generation via voice control is nice and useful but expected. Don’t get me wrong, I like being able to control lightbulbs via voice commands but it just doesn’t have the same allure as being able to control other devices in the home. The lightbulb is simply a GE lightbulb with a wifi receiver which allows it to accept commands from a wifi transmitter such as the Google Home smart speakers, the Google WiFi router or your home wifi router. The “Home Mini Chalk” is one of Google’s smaller “Home” smart speaker/assistants. I think of it as ‘Google Home Lite’, because the entire device is only the size of a hockey puck. You can do everything with the Mini Chalk that you can with the ‘Home’ except raise the level of the sound fidelity to that of the Google Home or Home Max. The rationale for obtaining a “Home Mini” instead of a “Home” or “Home Max” is cost and thus affordability, for this device is inexpensive enough to buy for every room of the house or apartment. Like all of Google’s smart home devices, this smart speaker is a lot of fun, seriously ‘cool’, and very easy to setup. BTW: Google’s “Home”, “Home Max” and “Home Mini” smart speakers install and work exactly the same way so if you also come across my review of them, you may notice considerable similarity. So long as you have a nearby power outlet, a Google login, a smartphone to load the “Google Home” app, and a home wireless router within range, the voice activated Google “Home Mini” personal assistant will be a breeze to install and use. Once it is setup, it’s “Look ma, no hands”. All I had to say was “Hey Google” and fire-off a question or command. I’m glad these devices include touch as well as voice controls for volume, and mic mute so I can just touch it with a finger to adjust the volume without always having to do it verbally. I also like broadcasting my voice messages throughout the house wherever a Google Home, smart speaker exists."
5.0,8 months ago,ebay.com,Fourth Google Mini Purchased for my Home.,"This is the fourth Google Mini that I have in my home now. I have had Google Minis in my home spread throughout the house over three floors for various reasons. They are great for getting information that is pertanant to whatever project you may be working on, for any questions you may have including the weather, definitions/pronounciations, time of day, pretty much anything that you would like to know about. You can set timers and alarms as well. My only initial problem was asking Google questions in phrases that it could understand. That was probably the most difficult thing to get used to. I also have Google Play music and with the assistance of the Google Assistant on my cell phone, I was able to have all four speakers play music at the same time giving me tunes throughout the house. Perfect for doing chores or just listening to music/ books/etc. throughout the home without any latency. All in all this is a great product and would recommend it to anyone. I purchased one for my 77 year old mother and she loves it. I was a bit apprehensive at first because she does not do technology well, but she picked right up on it!Less"
3.0,3 months ago,lowes.com,A great Hub and a DIM Bulb,"This starter kit really consists of 2 products: First is the Home Automation Mini Hub, it works great easily integrating with Google Home and operating all of the compatible devices I tested it with flawlessly. It is very easy to install and configure. The sensitivity and discrimination seem to be very good. Second is the GE C-Life Smart Bulb, a 760 lumen LED bulb with a built in Bluetooth interface that lets the mini hub control it (on/off/dim). The Bluetooth interface limits the distance between the bulb and the mini hub to about 60 feet; this is implied when the directions tell you to put the mini hub in the same room as the bulb but they don't explain why. To me that the C-Life is an A19 and is only available in the 760 lumen size (a 60 watt equivalent) is a very real drawback. In my home all of the table lamps use higher output bulbs (most of them 3-way). Replacing any of these bulbs with the C-Life got me complaints from the other family members about having to read in the dark. The mini hub gets a 4 or 5 star rating, the bulb gets a 1 or 2; so I give the kit the average of the two -- 3 starsLess"
4.0,4 months ago,lowes.com,If you like the automation.......,"this is probably a good product of choice. I hear negative reviews about the other voice activated product but this one was worth trying. Easy setup and I have it in my living room, close to wireless router and table lamp with smart led bulb installed. Worked well to shut off lamp and I was intrigued by the choice of male/female voice. Didn't realize the vast selection of activities that exist but you must purchase/have the compatible devices for voice or smart phone use. I was kinda impressed with the voice commands I was able to use for play music (choice), ask any question, control volume, mic sensitivity, etc. I even asked it who would be elected president in 2020 (ha-ha!) The speaker is 'OK' for music but, of course, doesn't beat a regular hi-fi system. I guess a big limitation would be keeping it in the same room (within your voice range) with the controlled smart device but I guess that's what the smart phone app is for. However, any compatible devices throughout the home would have to be wi-fi enabled and ""found"" by your router.Less"

It will find your google mini home and then you can start catering it for your experience. I mainly use it as a speaker for music. The music isn't bad for the mini speaker, so don't have high expectations for sound quality. The google mini software is surprisingly good compared to the other smart speakers out there. I frequently use it to ask google for weather, traffic news, and daily headlines. Occasionally I will ask it for a specific question and it will do it's best to answer the question. I've always wanted a smart bulb and this kit makes it easy to use. Just plug in the bulb, to the existing socket, and then pair it up with the google home app and you're set. The pairing process takes about 1-2 minutes for it to find. The dimmable bulb is easily adjusted, and you can set a time when it will always be on. It's great as a diversion so that it looks active in your home. One thing to note is that it does have a slight delay when telling the google home to turn it on. The bulb is more of a warm yellow compared to bright daylight. If you're looking for a assistant, give this one a go. Highly recommended setup to get your smart home experience in action.Less"
3.0,4 months ago,lowes.com,Good but has limitations,"Upon initial start up of the Google Home, I was impressed. It was easy to activate and connect but only to certain products. I had no problems connecting to my WEMO lights and the light that came with it. Problems were connecting to the Nest thermostat. I would have thought that this would have been the easiest of all since Google now owns Nest. I had to contact tech support and they referred me over to the team that is dedicated to migrating the Nest over to the Google platform. After that was done, I was reconnected to tech support for help on the other devices and I was disappointed to find that they are not compatible. The Schlage digital door lock and the MyQ garage door opener were not supported. One required a subscription and I was not about to pay for it so I now have to maintain multiple apps to support all of my devices. Some day they may all be under one umbrella but for now, I will manage multiple platforms. On the plus side, I am enjoying the Google Assistant. I like having my questions answered just asking verbally and not having to sit down and type it out on a search engine. I do like and would recommend it but know that it has drawbacks.Less"
5.0,4 months ago,ebay.com,"Buy one, I did","We have 6 of these speakers in our house and they are awesome. I bought the first one for my daughter's room. She was afraid of going into her room when it was dark, so I added some of the white hue lights, and now she can say, ""Hey Google, can you turn on my lights?"" It's a great feature, but they can do so much more. We use them a lot to broadcast messages to the kids, synchronize music through the whole house (great for cleaning days or getting the kids to unplug from their tablets and phones). One of my favorite features is to say ""Hey Google, good morning"" when I get out of bed and it will rattle off a ton of info like time, weather, current temp, traffic, top news stories, history factoids, etc. And you can tailor it to your interests. The only real con with this device. The sound quality while playing music is better at lower volumes. You can't exactly 'rock out' with this device, however Google has created a workaround that allows you to sync to a Bluetooth speaker and play music that way.Less"
5.0,4 months ago,lowes.com,Google Mini - Handy - like Alexa,"I already have Alexa so this allows a comparison. It is a much smaller device than Alexa. Setup is easy - you just download the Google Home app to your smart phone or tablet and follow the instructions. After setup it actually found one more gadget in the house to control than Alexa did - so off to a good start. Whereas I use Alexa to control a smart plug with a connected multi bulb lamp, the Google Mini comes with a smart bulb that it can control without having to use a smart plug. Like Alexa you can just talk to it to ask questions or control something. I have it connected to and controlling Netflix on my TV. Because the unit is much smaller than Alexa the sound from it when you are playing a radio station through it lacks the bass which the much bigger Alexa has. The flip side is that it only has a small footprint. Once setup you do not need your phone to be on to use the Mini. Just say ""OK Google"" then talk to it - to ask a question or give it a command. Great fun!Less"
4.0,a year ago,Target,"This set would be a great intro to test the waters of smart home products or a perfect addition to smart home products you are already using. The GE C-Life smart light bulb is pretty straightforward so we'll start there. Just screw it into a regular socket, pair in the Google Home app and you are ready to go. You can use voice commands to control it through the Google Mini ""Hey Google, turn on the light"", ""Hey Google dim the light"", write it into programs through the Google Home app (for example you can easily add it to preprogrammed tasks, ""Hey Google goodnight"" can be set to turn out the light as well as ask about an alarm for the morning, give tomorrows weather, play nature sounds and a range of other tasks). You can also use IFTTT for other applets (like automatically turning on at dusk) or build your own. You can also turn the bulb on/off and set brightness through the Google Home app. The lighting itself is a pleasant ""soft white"" that isn't harsh or overly bright even at the brightest setting. I've seen the Google Home Mini described as ""donut sized"" and that's pretty accurate, it's small enough to tuck just about anywhere. Appearance wise I think it's a lot cuter than the Echo Dot and I love the variety of colors available (I also have it in coral!) but I'm not a fan of the fabric material across the top. I feel like it will get dusty over time or dirty if used in an area like the kitchen especially if you use touch controls. It does include a micro USB cord with wall charger or any basic micro USB cord and USB charger will work if you need something longer or shorter. Other than the microphone on/off switch on the back there are no other buttons on the device itself but it does have built-in touch controls. Tap the sides to change the volume and use a long tap for pause/play. You can easily cast music from your phone once linked but only when both devices are on the same wifi. Unlike the Echo Dot, there is no aux out. You can easily link other Cast-enabled devices or you can link other devices using Bluetooth but for me, that was a bit of a struggle. It's not easy to find through the app and even with Bluetooth paired sadly only some of my Bluetooth speakers worked correctly. So why would you want to add other speakers? Well, the Mini has fair to good sound for music but it's not best. It's really nice to be able to play through a higher quality speaker while still having the benefits of Google and you can also set up several as a ""home"" to play throughout the house without having to buy multiple Google branded products. Other than music we use our Google Mini's more than expected. The options are pretty much endless and we are learning new ways to use it all the time but we mostly use it for pretty basic tasks. My three year old asks ""her"" (you can change it to a variety of voices both male and female including John Legend) to spell words, sing songs and tell him stories. I use it for alarms, timers, reminders, to add to my shopping list and calendar, to check the weather and other quick day to day tasks. You can also use it to make phone calls which will show as your cell phone calling on the receiving end but embarrasingly enough I mostly use that feature to call my own lost phone.

4.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Fun and useful device,"First experience with smart home devices and wasn't sure what to expect. Was given one as a gift and liked it so I decided to get a couple more. It is great for playing music in a room by saying hey Google, play jazz or similar. It will only play a specific song if you have it on a device or you subscribe to a particular U tube service, that's a little annoying. You can control lights etc. but you have to purchase other smart devices like light bulbs which are not cheap. Telling it to turn on or off the light is handy and not just a cool trick. You can broadcast from one device to another which means you can say a message and it will relay it to another device and ask if the person listening wants to respond. That's great if you want to tell someone something in another room but of course, there has to be another device there. If you're willing to invest it can have a lot of useful functions beyond lights and music. Eventually houses will come with all of this stuff built in but until then we'll have to buy them one piece at a time.Less"
3.0,a month ago,Currys,Sharon's review of Google Home Mini,"Pros: My 16 year old son loves it. Feel it is good for all ages and plenty to do with it. Watching TV, listening to music, having a chat, playing games on your own or with family,making phone calls and more. Can be connected to more than one TV if connected correctly. Customers service very helpful, however, needs to know a bit about there products to be able to assist better. But all were great and called back to check that l was happy and device was working correctly.Teaches you to speak, clearly, In sentences to allow Google mini to understand you and assist correctly.Gets young people talking and using the correct grammar rather than constantly looking on there phones. A little more interactive. That's what we need in 2020. Cons: Didn't realise l needed a chrome cast device to connect to my TV to be able to work the Google mini. Not very expensive however, it is definitely needed if you want Google to switch over your TV and watch different shows. A bit difficult to set up when trying to set it up on more than one TV however, is doable with customer services assistance,talking you through everything.Less"
4.0,a year ago,lowes.com,Nice little entry into the world of smart speakers,"Google Home/Mini/Max Smart Speakers Initial Setup and Performance: The Google Home was the last module received and was just as easy to set up. A quick check with the Google Home app found that the Home was waiting for connection. The controls integrated into the top are more versatile and responsive than those found in the Home Mini or Home Max, with the pause and volume functions on the top that worked well. Voice commands on the Home worked well, although there was often some confusion between speakers in the kitchen and living room when I tried to get the Home to play music. If the Mini could hear me better, it would start playing music rather than the Home. I don't doubt that there's a setting that would remedy this, but I haven't found it yet. Speaking of sound quality, the three speakers (Home, Home Mini and Home Max) were as expected, with the sound quality and maximum volume increasing with size. While none of them were a substitute for a proper hifi system, each was of adequate quality for background listening. The big boy, the Max was capable of respectable sound quality and volume in a smallish room like my office although it was no match for either the monitors attached to my computer (M-Audio Studiophile DX4) or my vintage 2-channel system with large English monitors. Most surprising though was the sound quality that came from the Home speaker, the mid sized one. I could hear actual bass coming from them and I was repeatedly and pleasantly surprised by the quality of the Pandora stream being played. This is the Mama Bear of the three, just right, not too big but big enough to please. As I have an Amazon Echo Dot placed beside the kitchen Home Mini, I was able to evaluate the relative sound quality between them, as well as the effectiveness of their responses. In terms of the sound quality, the Echo Dot has a fairly thin and tinny sound, befitting its low price. It's good for low background listening or spoken audio, such as news. The Home Mini has a much smoother sound, and although lacking in bass, makes those spoken audio or short audio clips much more listenable. However, if you're like my wife, you will play it loud without a care for the sound quality and anything, including her transistor radio, will do that. As far as the quality of the responses to questions go, simple stuff like ""how many milliliters in a quart"" or ""what's the nearest Italian restaurant"" are pretty easy and accurate. But the AI response for most other things is pretty lacking. One advantage of the Echo is that it can notify you when your package has shipped or arrived and Google has yet to yield that information to me. Of course, you will be expected to ask it to tell you a joke, but Google, was it necessary to have the punch line end with a figurative rimshot? The noises at the end are just juvenile and Amazon doesn't use them. Impressions and Conclusions: Any of the Home speakers will interface with the Google system and the Home Mini is small and inconspicuous for placement around the house. The original Home is the Goldilocks/Mama Bear, just right. It takes up hardly more room on a table than the Mini but has a fully-baked sound quality. Which brings us to the Home Max. Yes, it's sound quality is even better, but at a cost of size. It has transitioned from a compact smart speaker to a large unit that occupies quite a lot of space, filling a bookshelf or other similar sized space. If you want your smart speaker to substitute for a full-fledged sound system, then this is your speaker. But perhaps a better choice would be a Google-compatible receiver and speakers that would outpace the Max in sound quality."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Cheap Entry to Smart Home Setup,"---SETUP--- This device requires two items to set up, the included Google Assistant (a Wifi speaker) and the included WiFi light bulb. The lightbulb is installed like any regular light bulb and works with or without WiFi. The Google Assistant needs to be plugged into the wall with the included adapter and requires the download of the Google Home app to complete set up. ---FEATURES--- The key feature of this starter kit is that it turns individual, compatible WiFi light bulbs into smart lights that can be controlled with your voice. Included are one Google Assistant speaker and a regular sized light bulb. ---PERFORMANCE--- The performance of both the speaker and the light bulbs were very responsive. After I learned the specific commands that Google recognizes for the lights, I was able to get them to do what I wanted. ---EXPECTATIONS--- The product meets my expectations. I was able to dim the lights from 1% to a full bright of 100%. The particular light bulb included (760 lumens) only goes to a very bright yellow. I own two other WiFi light bulbs (800 lumens) that are also a bright yellow but all together installed on the same ceiling fan, they didn’t look any different in terms of brightness. The previously installed light bulbs were all white lights, but since these are going in a theatre room, the yellow with dimmable option works better for me. ---VALUE--- The price for the starter kit in terms of value is very good. Even if you don’t end up liking the way the WiFi lights work, which I didn’t think I would but now I can’t stop dimming them constantly because I can, you still get a Google Assistant speaker, which on its own can tell you the weather, the time, be an alarm clock, and do all sorts of other things you ask it to, like search up definitions of words while you’re reading a book. ---APPROVAL--- I highly recommend this product for people who are trying to dip their toes into what a smart home could be for them. It’s an easy and cheap way to see what smart homes are all about and you can start growing your setup over time.Less"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Love so much we bought more!,"We have Google Home and these Google Minis are absolutely perfect for other rooms in the house where we want something a little smaller! We use it so often to check the weather and ask it other random questions that we didn't want to constantly have to be near the main unit to use it. We placed a Mini in our master bedroom upstairs and we use it every morning and every night at the very least. We also use it frequently to play music while we sort laundry on our bed with our 5 kids (that takes a while and the music makes it seem like a little less of a chore.) The sound quality has been excellent and we have had zero issues with it since we bought them. We even bought another one to give one of our daughters for her basement bedroom. She chooses her school clothes each day based on the weather forecast and we don't allow smartphone or tablets in bedrooms (for social media purposes and because our kids would probably hide away in their rooms), so this is the only way she can check the weather without having to come upstairs to ask the main Google Home about the weather forecast. I have the one in our bedroom set up to my own voice so that when I say ""Good Morning"" to it, it tells me the current temperature, the forecast for the day, and what's on my calendar. I can also opt (through the app) to have it tell me about news stories, my work commute and traffic, the stock market, and other options that I can't remember because I don't use them. (I work from home so I have no traffic commute but I bet that would be a helpful feature for those that do!) I prefer Google Home over Amazon's Alexa, but do hope Google will start coming out with more products that are compatible with Google Home. I see a LOT of products as being compatible with Alexa but Google seems to be falling a little short in that category. It's not importatn enough to me to warrant buying an Alexa as we really love playing games on our Google Home and enjoy the many features, but something to consider if you're wanting a lot of add-ons that are compatible with your smarthome product."

If you already have Google Home installed, you're set to go—otherwise, there'll be a 10-25 minute setup (depending how comfortable and experienced you are with such things). Google Home can not only control this light, but can use the Bridge Home Automation Hub to deliver music, launch web queries, and more. One thing that was missing for me—or perhaps I just overlooked it—was how to dim the light rather than simply turn it off and on. On a whim, I said ""Hey, Google—Floor Lamp [the name I'd assigned to the light] 80%."" The hub responded by turning the light to 80% brightness. I think it goes as low as around 5-10% and as high as 100%. Music playing through the speaker in this hub sounds shallow and tinny to me. The hub can be set up to cast to a Chromecast (such as I have plugged into my TV) but I'm not sure if it has other methods (such as bluetooth) to stream music to another, better sound system.Less"
5.0,3 months ago,lowes.com,Easy setup and really helpful,"The setup for the home automation kit was very simple using the Google Home app on an Ipad. We are using the kit in a bedroom with the included smart bulb in a table lamp. The voice control provides easy adjustment of the light output from OFF to 100% so the lighting level can be set as needed. Names can be assigned to each bulb that is added to control lighting at different locations. Commands such as ""Play rain sounds"" and ""Play ocean wave sounds"" are nice to use as sleep aids. The local weather forecast can be requested to help in deciding what to wear for the day. The device understands requests for different types of music and will locate and play data streams for the requested genre. We are still learning to use all the features but found the device to be immediately useful with it's outstanding voice recognition and home automation capabilities.Less"
5.0,4 months ago,lowes.com,Better than Alexa,"We've owned a number of Amazon's Alexa products over the years (Echo, Dot, Auto) and was unsure whether to put a Google product into the mix. Well, this one works just fine. The combo of the Bridge and the smart light were just what we needed to give it a try. The setup was much easier than the Alexa app; it downloaded faster and was more intuitive. A very nice feature was that it accessed the WiFi password resident on the phone so I didn't have to dig up our network password. Linking up the light was easy as well; turn it on and wait for it to connect after activating the app. The Google Hub works like Alexa (with an eerily similar voice), but with a more natural verbal cadence and verbal inflections. The ONLY thing we don't like about the new system is that you can't rename it from Google to your preference. My wife hates having to yell ""Hey Google"" to activate the controls. Other than that, very pleasantly surprised at the tone, volume, and quality of the product.Less"
4.0,4 months ago,lowes.com,My first smart home hub,"I have been interested in trying a smart home hub, but it's so overwhelming to pick a device! I started small with the mini Google Home and smart light. Set up for the Google Home was very easy. Just plug in, download the app, and follow instructions. The process to install the light was simple as well, but I had a lot of issues. It took several tries to get the app to recognize the bulb. I eventually had to do a factory reset on the bulb, but now everything is working. I love that we can change the brightness of the light without having to install new switches. I am able to play music through the Google Home, and it tells me the weather while I'm getting ready for work. You can also set nature sounds for background noise (like rain, fireplace, etc). I haven't used the calling feature yet to make phone calls, but I think it will come in very handy. I recently moved and do not have smart devices (like a thermostat) to connect, but that's on my to do list. I can't wait to see what else we can connect. This is a great device!Less"
4.0,a year ago,Home Depot,"This was our third Google Home Mini purchase, which we bought after getting 2 standard Google Hom...","This was our third Google Home Mini purchase, which we bought after getting 2 standard Google Home assistants and 2 Home Minis about 10 months ago. We love them all! We purchased them initially because it gave us the ability to designate speaker ""groups"" for playing music in different areas of the house or throughout the entire house, which we thought would be very convenient for parties. And it is!!! The sound is great for the compact size, and for just playing music in certain rooms, the addition of the Mini with its relatively low cost allows you to have that capability in several areas without spending a ton. And it's nice that they are so portable from one location to another. We've attempted to figure out the best music service to use with the Google Home, but this will be more of a personal preference. The Google Home products work with Google Play Music, YouTube Music, Spotify, Pandora, and Deezer. Some of these have limited options you can use without purchasing a subscription, but we did find that many of the songs we asked for were not available without a subscription. So...if you're not a current subscriber or are opposed to a music subscription service, you may wish to investigate prior to making a purchase. We chose to try the Spotify free trial, which we really do enjoy. However, we have found that only one device (or device group) per Spotify user (subscription) can be using the service at a time, but this is a Spotify subscription limitation, not a Google Home issue. It's just something to be aware of if you are a novice comparing music services. Prior to purchasing Google Home products, we had not had experience using an ""Assistant"" of any kind, so I cannot compare ease of use or capabilities to other models, but the Google Home app was very easy to set up on our phones and once we did, setting up the speakers was straight forward and easy too. It has been nice to have them around for questions without having to stop what you're doing to look things up, like if you need measurement conversions from ml to cups for a recipe, or something similar, you just ask! And if you need to pause the music, you just say so instead of tracking down your phone to tap pause. It is quite convenient, especially if you have dirty hands or need to act quickly. My understanding is that there are also Roku sticks that are compatible with the Google Home/Assistant for voice controls, which we do have, but we have not attempted to use that feature. The only reason I rated the Mini at 4 stars instead of 5 is because the touch controls are different from the standard Google Home, and it would be much easier if they both operated the same way. It's not difficult to use the controls on either device, but if a customer has both types and takes a little time to catch on to new things, I can see the differences being confusing to someone who has challenges with operating electronics. Overall, we LOVE the Google Home products. It should be noted that if you're on the fence about trying this line, you can use the Home Mini on its own without the standard Google Home. This provides the option of testing the capabilities of the Google Assistant and the music services without a large initial investment so you can determine if it fits in with your lifestyle and what you want it to do. We also found that it makes a nice gift! These products have definitely met our expectations, and we would recommend giving them a try!"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,A great starter kit that's easy to implement,"The Google Smart Light Starter kit consists of a Google Home Mini and a C-Life A19 Smart Bulb. The Google Home Mini is a pancake-shaped speaker that communicates using Google Assistant. Setting the Mini up on our network was incredibly easy largely because we are already set up with other Google Home products. By that I mean that we already have the Google Home App installed on our phones, and already have a Google Home speaker installed elsewhere in our house. Part of the setup process is to choose a room where you will install the Mini. I chose a room down the hall from where we already have a Google Speaker installed. The installation process took about 6-7 minutes to complete because it also downloaded a software update. At the end of the installation process, I was asked to identify the room where the Mini was located so as to easily identify it in the Home App when needed. Once the Mini was installed, I took the C-Life Smart Bulb and screwed it into a light fixture in a room adjacent to where the Mini was sitting. Keep in mind that the installation guide very specifically states to use a light fixture in the ‘same’ room as the Mini. The Google Home App had some difficulty completing the Smart Bulb installation because it wasn’t in the same room, so I moved the bulb back to a light fixture where the Mini was located. In but a few moments, the Google Home App located the bulb. I then named the bulb so the App could distinguish it from other smart bulbs in our house, and the setup process ended. Once everything was communicating properly, I removed the bulb and screwed it back into a light fixture in the next room. And yes, it works perfectly even though the Mini and the bulb are in adjacent rooms. (Keep in mind that the C-Life Smart Bulb uses Bluetooth technology to communicate with the Mini, and Bluetooth has distance limitations). Between the installation of the Mini and setting up the C-Life bulb, I doubt it took longer than 15 minutes to get everything working properly. I can now control the new smart bulb using the Google Home App, or by using the Google Assistant command “Okay Google”. Plus, I can turn this bulb and others on or off, plus dim or brighten them, even if I’m away from the house."

I have used it for a month and at first it worked perfect. I didn't have any issues. I would turn on the light bulb in the morning with out telling Google to turn it on and it would turn on then I would tell Google to turn it off without any problem. Unfortunately everything is not perfect, after a week or less the Google mini would not work. Either the mini would not send the signal or the bulb would not respond. I don't know since they work together. I thought the problem occurred when I turn off the light WITH the switch, I ended tapping the switch so I wouldn't use it. But after 3 or 4 days the light didn't respond again. I have bestbuy buy elite and today is my last day to return it. Bestbuy buy is closed but It won't stop me form writing this review. If your like me the only way of fixing the problem is resetting the bulb and connecting it again with the Google mini. I'll try the GE APP this time and if it works for more then a week then the mini is the problem. I hope Google fixes the problem or GE .Less"

My only comment is the light it gives, it's not too bright in my opinion. But as a starter kit, I can forgive that. I will have to buy more of these smart light to serve my purpose.

2.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Wants all your personal information & to track you,"Typical of Google, all they want is all your personal information and to track you. I set up this Google mini according to instructions, all went well, but when it got to allowing it to have all my personal information and to track me, I said no. It had my Google email address, so it had some of my information, it had it’s location/exact address, and time zone. Yet it couldn’t even give me the current weather. All this Google mini would do is basic internet functions. I linked it with my smart plugs and switches in the app, and it worked. I could control things through the app but not with the Google mini so I could use voice commands. This is ridiculous. There is no reason it could not do more with the information it had. As soon as I allowed it to have my location on my mobile phone with the Google app it could, all of a sudden, do everything. Everything was linked via my WiFi and could communicate, and used with the app, without the app knowing where I was all the time. Using the link to Google’s privacy policy online was a huge eye opener. This is why I use a VPN and download apps like these to an old iPhone that sits on a shelf & doesn't get used.Less"
2.0,7 months ago,bt.com,Mick's review of Google Home Mini,"Pros: Access to Google assistant means answers to general questions are consistently good, the polar opposite of Alexa, which has a default response of ""I'm sorry, I don't know that"" to pretty much any question asked. Cons: Every other aspect of the product is inferior to the Alexa devices. Microphones are weak and useless if there is any background noise. The wake word is too long and can't be changed, the response to any smart home command is ridiculously verbose, in a digital American voice and can't be customised. The list goes on. I really wanted this to be an improvement on my Alexa devices, but beyond the ""general knowledge"" aspect that is linked to Google search, every other aspect is miles behind and so locked down it's like Google are consciously trying to ignore the marketplace and defy the will of the customer. If the device was as customisable as Alexa devices it would be an absolute winner, other than the poor microphones.Less"

3.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Its ok. Little quirky at times,"I picked this up a while ago and use it for very basic commands. I do have this by my bed, so commands like ""whats the temp right now, the weather for today?"" and get a decent reply is helpful. Also for me - since I do not like to have ANY ambient light in my bedroom while I sleep (ex. Devices with the annoying blue LED lights, which seem to be on everything now. I don't even like a lit up digital clock), asking Google in a dark room ""what time is it?"" is a big help also. There are a few devices I simply cannot connect to though like my home security system - although it shows up on my phones app. it just doesnt work for whatever reason. Also, the ""quirky"" thing I mentioned, there have been times when Google would just activate out of nowhere..yes even as I slept. (Very odd!) It would try to answer some random question out of nowhere, TV is not on, nothing to trigger ""Hey Google."" There has been a few times where I would have to unplug it, plug it back in, or a hard reset after the device just fails to answer basic commands. For the price I paid, its ok. If the price drops more on this older mode and you only want simple commands..I say go for it. But I think I would wait for an upgraded mode. Perhaps look into better models, brands as these become much cheaper. For the price and only using this for very simple commands - I recommend it.

That works too - even in the 20+ below 0 weather we've been having frequently - however, probably given the farther distance from the google mini and that there's a wall between the signal, I noticed it sometimes doesn't work. It generally does, though after a couple tries. Now, my wife has had more issues with the setup not responding than I have.

3.0,a year ago,lowes.com,Good way to start a smart home,"Note Smart light would be a one star while the Mini is a 5. I would recommend the Mini but not the GE smart Bulb. Google Smart Light starter Kit Included: 1 Google Home Mini 1 GE C-Life smart bulb 1 AC adapter Get started instruction card Needs: WiFi network Electrical outlet Android or iOS device with Blue tooth enabled C by GE app iOS A google account This bulbs is a lower cost “smart bulb” choice. As you can only really turn the bulb on and off it is not really too smart. This light should pretty easy to set up, and it is--kind of. You need to set up an account with C by GE app. Then you have to link it to the Google Home app via the Works with Google selection in the Home set up section. While I got the bulb to work from the C by GE app, I could not get the Google Home app to connect to the bulb. Unfortunately the C by GE app is very basic and only lets you turn this bulb on and off. The C-Life bulb is budget bulb. Connecting by Bluetooth directly to your phone. I can not really recommend this bulb since I could only connect this unit via its own app – on off – which is not a big deal for the cost. Google Home Mini Included: Google Home Mini AC power adapter Needed WiFi network Electrical outlet Android or iOS device with Blue tooth enabled Google Home A google account The Mini is powered by the Google Assistant. You can ask it question, set alarms and reminders, get news, traffic info, make calls to your contacts list, use it as an intercom with two or more Google Home units, play back music and connect to Bluetooth speakers all by speaking commands to the Mini. The hand size Home Mini has a fabric mesh, but it’s conductive to your touch in a few areas. Tapping the top pauses and resumes play. Placing a finger on the left and right sides of the speaker lowers and raises the volumes. While you navigate with your voice or touch, the Home Mini will illuminate four LEDs on its top to show that your action has been registered. This unit features a micro USB port on its rear to provide power, and a microphone switch that enables you to turn off active listening. On it's bottom, you can see a circular rubber mat to keep it still on your table. Mini comes in coral (peach), chalk (grey) or charcoal (black). Mine was chalk and blended well in my living room. Voice recognition isn't hurt due to its small size or price. Good results were obtained from across the room or speaking gently 10 feet away, with only an occasional need to repeat commands. “Ok Google” is the start command. OK GOOGLE SET A TEN MINUTE TIMER FOR PIZZA. You string commands together such as OK GOOGLE PLAY BRIDGE OVER TROUBLE WATERS ON SPOTIFY The Home Mini can take control of many external things. Stream music through music apps like Pandora, Spotify, YouTube Music, iHeartRadio and more. It can send a request to pull up a YouTube video over to your Chromecast (another smart unit). The Home Mini is also a smart home hub in that it can also integrate with smart divines like the C-Life bulb but I couldn't test this (see bulb review above) Connecting through the Google Home app and Home will teach you things about the Home Mini, like how it works and resources that provide instant access to a wide variety of free audio content. If you want to use the Home Mini as a Bluetooth speaker, the Google Home app offers up pairing settings, though they are rather buried within the app. Once your smartphone is set up with the Home Mini, it’s simple to begin listening. Either give the speaker a shout for some tunes, being as specific or obscure as you’d like, or just hit the Cast button near the top to give your phone free reign to push its audio straight to the Home Mini. The Mini is really a desk unit or can give you a cheap way to extend your Home Google network anywhere within range of your WiFi, outdoor shed, pool area (note NOT water proof), think intercom. It is great if you’re are using it to get a glimpse at your calendar, hear the latest news or phone a friend. But if you’re looking for something that will faithfully reproduce your favorite music, this isn’t the best solution out there. This mini speaker can get fairly loud, but there’s no bass. If you’re in the market for a cheap speaker, the Google Home Mini will do the trick Disclosure I was provided this unit for evaluation by Lowes."

But when it comes to the Smart side of the product, if you have a SONY Smart TV, there is a problem right now that Google Home Mini won't connect to the TV to do what it's supposed to do. I called the help desk, and apparently Google and SONY are working to make the fixes. However, since the reason I bought the product is to start making my home SMART, then the product has failed in that department. It was funny to hear the rep ask me if I'd tried the Smart Lights or Smart Thermostat, and I told him, why would I invest in other Smart products, when the Google Assist can't even run my TV. Also, if you're not subscribed to a premium music service, you cannot directly request a specific song by a specific artist...you will only be able to request playing a generic genre of music, like Top 40 music. For $25, Google Home Mini is a great little toy for my son to play around with, but until the fixes are made to control the SONY TVs, I'm not a big fan right now.Less"

The included bulb is a GE C-Life smart bulb, with quality that is standard for the market - not a lot of frills but useful in its limited functions. Installation is as simple as screwing in a light bulb, literally. After plugging in the Mini and going through a short set of start-up prompts using the free Google Home app, pairing the bulb with the speaker was a quick, painless process. From the app, you can adjust the light, or you can speak aloud for the brightness setting. You can also set a timer or schedule for the light to turn on and off and at your chosen brightness. Simple, useful, smart. The Mini itself is nice and louder than I expected. It catches my voice from the next room over if I speak clearly and without much interference, giving me useful answers to my questions about the day's weather, traffic on my route to work, the last day's news cycle, sports scores, etc. It sets timers and tells jokes on cue - all the useful and useless things you will come to expect from a smart device. Overall, I think this is a nice value for a starter kit. The Mini is responsive, useful, and unobtrusive, while the bulb does the job.

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,You Light Up My Life,"Description Google Mini: The Google Home Mini is a voice-controlled speaker that can be used for controlling smart devices like the enclosed light bulb alone or other brand bulbs with a hub, asking questions of Google, set up an alarm to wake up, ask for the time or weather, listening to music or even listening to the radio, which is definitely cheaper than buying a radio. Set Up for Google Mini and Bulb: Set up is very simple. Download the Google Assist app onto your phone and let it find the Google Mini with Bluetooth on. Once it is found, you can control the bulb through the Google Home Mini with voice or use the Google app on your phone if you are away from home turning it off or on both verbal and via the app. No hub is required like other bulbs. You can also dim the bulb by telling Google Mini to do it by the percentage you would like it at from 1% (use as a nightlight) and up to 100% if you want it back to normal 60W. Light Bulb: The GE C-Life bulb is an inexpensive bulb and with this you can see if you like having smart bulbs in your home. It replaces a standard 60-watt bulb. I am amazed at how much electricity I have saved by having these type bulbs throughout my home and they are VERY long-lasting compared to regular bulbs. The bulb is rated to last up to 20 years, so you don’t have to worry about changing the bulbs. C by GE app: If you want to set up the light automatically to turn on/off at a certain time of day or night time this app will let you do it. This way you can have the lights on when you come home from work before you walk in the door or are away on vacation, so it looks like someone is home. Other than that I see no need for downloading this app, but it is a really nice feature. Recommendation: I think this is a great inexpensive way to start a Smart Home.

I love being able to say “hey google turn off the kitchen” or “hey google turn on the bed room fan.” I feel like my home has been brought into the future by use of this super easy to use device of the future. I never thought I would see the day that such a cost effective device would be available to me to automate my household. My father is also unable to get up and he’ll ask google to call me if he can’t reach his phone. This actually saved his life last year when he fell and couldn’t get up. It called me and I was able to call 911 and save my daddys life. So it truly is a life saver! I highly recommend this product! It is so versatile. I especially recommend it if you have an elderly parent! You don’t have to be tech savvy to be able to operate or set it up either! And at leas than $30 each, you can’t beat it’!Less"
1.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Very disappointing if you own more than two,"In general, the Google home speaker system is lackluster and fails to rise much above a cute toy. In terms of playing music, even though the device is linked to a family music account, it will only play one song. This means kids and adults in separate rooms can't not listen to their own music selections. Speaker-to-speaker communication is non-existent. Each speaker has its own name, but you can't cast to a speaker specifically with a message. This means after one person goes to bed, no one can use Google home to communicate - even if they are in a separate room on a separate floor - because they will broadcast into any other's rooms and wake the sleepers. A second problem with broadcast is the lack of synchronization between speakers when broadcasting a message. A delay of up to 1/2 second is common and makes messages completely unintelligible. All the speakers have clocks inside them - why not use those clocks for a little bit of synchronization? Integration with other smart home services is superficial. We have Philips Hue lights (very cool), but the speaker very often mis-interprets simple commands like ""turn lights off"" as ""turn lights up"" and for controlling bulbs individually, you seem to have to say ""lamp"" instead of ""light,"" which is a departure from american colloquialism. I rarely have trouble with people understanding my English. Worse still, you can't access the ""neat"" features such as color profiles or light-based alarm settings. You must use the Hue app for that. The devices themselves seem to be flaky from time to time. Both my wife, my daughter, and myself have had the devices accept commands, acknowledge them, and then take no action. This could be ""singing a song"", ""broadcast a message,"" or tell me the weather. I can't quite seem to get the hang of when it's going to acknowledge its wake command. For instance, sitting a room away, I can at a moderate voice say ""ok google"" to wake my phone.... but the speaker down the hall around the corner in the next room takes over. On the other hand, if I'm 10 feet away from that speaker and give it a good authoritative ""OK GOOGLE"", I might get only a 50-50 shot at waking it. So, for the things I care most about - family communication, playing music, and controlling a smart home - the device is 0 for 3. I guess those Google speaker engineers live in tiny homes in Silicon Valley and only ever have one speaker at a time!"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Good Value for Smart Home Beginners,"Unless you're living under a rock, you've heard of Google Home and its capabilities. Whether or not you are a Google Home or Alexa user will inevitably depend on which ecosystem your invested in. If you're reading this, I'm assuming you're invested in the Google ecosystem or at least not so much invested into Amazon's Alexa. Either way, both of their ""mini"" devices (the Google Home mini and Alexa Echo Dot) are similar in their size and capabilities. They offer the voice link you need to your smart assistant without the advanced sound offerings. Yes, the mini will play music, etc. but it will never sound as good as any other Google Home speaker, including the Google Home. So assuming you're looking into investing in the Google Home ecosystem (I have, and I utilize it every single day) the Google Home mini PLUS GE smart bulb is a great way to start. It's also useful for anyone looking to add a Google Home mini to their house and adding smart bulbs (side note on smart bulbs, once you start buying them, you'll continue to do so, and you'll know they get expensive). In terms of setup of the mini, all you need is to download the Google Home app and plug in the mini. The home app will autmoatically detect it and set it up. Usually the first time set up requires an update that takes about 5 minutes. From there, the app does a good job of walking you through Google Home's capabilities and adjusting settings (such as what news will play when you say ""Hey Google, good morning""). I've been very impressed with the app in terms of teaching you what the home could do. When it first came out, it was a complicated un-user friendly mess to navigate. I think for first time smart home users, you'll appreciate the east to set it up and learn its capabilities. In terms of the GE bulb, it too is straight forward. You screw it into a light socket. From there you can set it up through the GE app or Google Home. I prefer the Google Home app because I want to be able to control my home from one app without having to link services. For example, if you set up Phillips Hue bulbs, or GE lights through GE's app, you then have to link the services within the Home app. Not a big deal, but it's an unnecessary step for a ""dumb"" smart light bulb. I say this bulb is ""dumb"" because your options are to turn it on and off and adjust the brightness. Phillips light bulbs are a little more complex in how they're controlled which necessitates (in my opinion) utilization of the Phillips Hue app at times (like changing colors). Much like the mini, the Google Home app will find the bulb and set it up. The app walks you through assigning it to a room and from there, you just say ""Hey Google"" (near your Google home mini of course) and ""turn off light [so and so]:"" And voila. Turning lights on and off via voice is absolutely not necessary but its addicting and oftentimes, convenient. Plus, you can always turn it off from your phone from bed if say, you forgot to turn off the lamp before heading to bed. As I said from the beginning, this is a good value for those just getting to dabble in the smart home convenience. Maybe you only need/want a couple lights that you can control remotely and via voice, and if so, this is a perfect solution. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because even though this package is a good value, it could be better given the deep discounts of the standalone Google Home mini around the holidays."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great way to test the waters of smart lighting,"Smart lights and smart speakers have been becoming increasingly popular as of late - allowing all of us to live out the fantasy of living on board the starship Enterprise and being able to boss our home around. But, oddly enough, you don't see much by the way of combination packs yet. This kit seeks to change that. There's nothing particularly notable about the contents - the provided bulb is fairly basic and incapable of doing much more than dimming, and the Google Home Mini is the most compact and basic device in the Home lineup. Sufficed to say there's a lot you don't get if you're planning to convert every room to smart lighting. But it's the perfect sampler configuration to let you work out if smart lighting is something that's actually worth investing more money in. Google has gone out of their way to make the process as painless as possible as well. The mini comes out of the box ready to pair with the bulb, and the excellent Home app will guide you through setup without any kind of fuss. It only takes a few minutes to get everything up and running, and from there controlling the light is as easy as telling the Mini what you want. If you do decide to take the plunge afterwards, the bulb they provided is one of the more affordable options for smart lighting and performs very well. There are definitely better systems for those willing to pay an extra premium, but if you're used to standard bulbs I don't think you'll have any complaints about this. Best part is that even if you do decide that smart lighting isn't worth investing in, a Google Home Mini is a pretty awesome device to have. it's a halfway decent speaker, a really good alarm clock, and a white noise machine among other things. As such I have no difficulty recommending it to anyone who's curious about setting up their own smart home.Less"
5.0,4 months ago,lowes.com,Very Surprised!,"When I opened the package, I thought I was getting a smart light bulb only. I was very surprised to find the Google mini inside. The mini and light bulb were very easy to set up. I and my family absolutely love the smart bulb because you can turn on, turn off, and dim the light by simply saying, ""hey Google, please turn on the light..."" I absolutely love this combination as I don't have to get up to turn on the light and other family members can also control the light setting. The Google mini is also linked to the Google Hub and able to control social media music accounts and ask it any question you would like. The speaker is amazing and has great bass. The light bulb's hue is perfect and very bright in the full setting and very soft in the dim setting. I would definitely recommend this product to family and friends. I love my smart bulb and Google mini.Less"
5.0,a year ago,lowes.com,A great little companion,"The Mini is strikingly small with a neutral, somewhat boring look, but that’s okay if you plan on putting these all over the home. The Mini’s size is perfect for getting out of the way and blending into the living room or kitchen, while still packing a decent speaker and touch controls for accessing volume. It’s also very appreciated that there’s a dedicated hardware switch to turn off the microphone, whether you just want a little privacy, or a friend doesn’t feel too comfortable house sitting with it on. Setting up the Google Home Mini is simple enough: Plug it in, download the Google Home app, sign-in to your Gmail/Google account, and the app walks you through the rest. You’ll be up and running in about 5 minutes. Google Home Mini is proving to be the easiest way to have your Google Assistant be omnipresent throughout your home. It’s a smart speaker that gets out of the way and doesn’t call attention from houseguests. Over time, you just expect it to be there and you’re able to just say “Hey Google,” and a hands-free portal to the web and your home opens. After saying the trigger phrase, you can ask anything from “Who was the 21st president of the USA,” to “What’s on my calendar for tomorrow?” It’s a great companion that seems like it can be placed anywhere. Voice control will most likely be the chosen method of control by most, but the Google Home app is outstanding for updating settings, learning what the Mini can do, and especially, streaming music to the device. Playing music through the Mini is a pleasant and simple experience, though, the speaker is a little weak to get too loud. That said, as a “set it and forget” device that disappears into the background of your bookshelf, all while providing your family a seriously smart assistant, the Mini would be a worthy purchase.Less"

It doesn't require an additional hub (like certain Phillips hue bulbs), it's dimmable, and I was surprised at how warm and natural the light is. I especially liked that the GE app is not required to operate the light. The speaker/hub is fine, basically google's version of an echo dot. Responds well to voice commands. It just doesn't seem to have as many skills/functions as Alexa (Apple Music, for example). The set up was little funky for the light, though. I had to factory reset the light in order to get it to work at first, which was an odd series of turning the light off and on. For what it's worth, I had an echo dot prior to receiving the google mini. I could not get the light to pair with the echo dot, even after downloading the app, adding the skill, etc.Less"
5.0,3 months ago,lowes.com,Super easy way to begin automating your home,"This is an easy hub and light kit to use. You basically plug the hub in and follow the couple of steps on the app. Then you are ready to use the hub (play music, ask questions, etc.). The bulb that is included is also super easy to connect to the hub. Just screw the bulb in, turn on the power, and use the app to connect it to the hub. Only thing to watch out for is to not give too many rapid fire commands (think teenager trying to test something), as that sometimes led to the hub/light not responding. Restarting the hub cleared out the backup. I don't really consider it a major flaw, as it is unlikely anyone is going to request a light be turned on and off like a strobe... I also have a Google Nest Home and it was easy to link this hub to it; now I can play music/control lights from either device. So, all in all this is a nice easy intro kit to begin to automate (using IoT) your home.Less"
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Google - Smart Light Starter Kit with Google,"Love this thing! I bought it while it was on sale for $35 which is a pretty good price, normally $55. Comes with one GE light bulb which is already paired in the Home Google app. Nothing additional to download to make it work. Other brand name bulbs you'll have to download apps to make them work. The setup process was very easy. Install the smart bulb and plug in the Google Home Mini in the same room. Since the bulb is Bluetooth-based, it will only work a short distance from the Google Home Mini. 1. Download the Google Home app to your iPhone, iPad or Android device. Upon opening the app, I saw a banner asking me to ""Setup 1 Device"". 2. The app walked me through setting up the Google Home Mini first. 3. The app then automatically asked me if I wanted to setup the bulb. It quickly found the bulb and added it to my Google Home profile. Because I liked this so much I bought 3 more combo units (Home Mini & GE Bulb) and have them all over. One of my favorite things is when I go to bed I tell the Home Google Mini ""good night"" and I have it set to tell me my reminders and weather for the next day. Then it asks what time I would like the alarm set for. I haven't been over sleeping since I put one of these in my bedroom. Recommend to everyone.Less"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,The Google Home Device Priced Right,"As an early adopter of the original Google Home, I realized quickly that I did not have enough of them around the house to make the assistant truly useful. Unfortunately, the original Home price does not make purchasing many of them easy. The mini solves that problem, especially when Best Buy has a deal for a free one with a Nest or Philips Hue purchase; or when they ran their deal for the free gift card with the reduced price. Now I have a bunch of these devices spread throughout the house and do not have to think about where I am when I want to access the assistant. As small as a bagel, sound is not great; but it does not have to be great to be useful. Placing them in the hallway, bathrooms, or children's bedrooms helps spread the assistant throughout the home so I can broadcast information to everyone, or control lights in each room. Saying ""turn on the lights"" without having to remember the proper room name is very convenient. Even when the volume is 60%, the sound is sufficient to fill a small space, and sounds okay without the stereo effect. (for better sound, a stereo with a Chromecast is the better option than a more expensive stand-alone speaker) At this price, it is also an ideal bathroom speaker to listen to music since you can change the music without having to touch it or your phone, and cheaper than most waterproof Bluetooth speakers. While not rated as water proof or water resistant, I have not damaged mine yet from the steam since I do not have it close to the shower. I also have mine mounted to the wall to help keep water from collecting in the base. (separate purchase required to get a mount) Overall, a worthwhile investment if interested in the smart-home ecosystem.Less"

4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Practical Smart Home Starter Pack,"For the purposes of this review, I'm sticking solely to the lighting kit - I've previously reviewed the C-Life bulbs and quite frankly, I find their strategy of limiting controlling the lights to either a Google Home or App premise severely limiting. So this review will be written from the stance of what I believe this kit to be - a practical gateway into building a smart home. The kit comes with a chalk white Google Home mini and a single light bulb. Google's Home mini is their smallest device that also boasts the full power of Google Assistant and home automation. Depending on where you are in your smart home journey, you might find that some smart home devices work better with Google Home than others do. An important item of note is - just because something works with Google Assistant does not mean it'll work seamlessly with Google Home. For example, my GE C-Life, Wemo, Hue, Sengled lights all work with the Google Home. So too, does my Simplisafe alarm system and Logitech Harmony setup. However, the one that doesn't play nice out of the box is my Ring video doorbell. Not really surprising since Amazon bought Ring. I also have a Chamberlin garage door opener, but they want me to pay to link my accounts... no thank you. I added the smart light to my existing setup in my home office as well as the Google Home mini. I honestly have nothing but good things to say about Google's platform. The AI is intelligent and always learning, and you can also mute the microphones when company comes over. If you're feeling paranoid, you can also log into your Google account and verify nothing's been recorded when the mic is off and you can also delete your request history. I set up the bulb that came in the kit to be controlled by my Google Home mini in my office - so now, when I walk into my office, I can simply tell Google Home mini to turn on the light and it works! A key difference from Google and Amazon's management system is that Google Home currently does not support creating custom groups - but, it's totally easy to work around. For example, if I'm speaking to the Google Home we have in the family room and I tell Google to ""Turn off the lights"", it'll only turn off the lights in the family room. If you're on the fence about getting into home automation, then this is a painless way to get started. As always, if you're adding this to an existing setup, you need to do the research and see if it'll work with what you have or if you'll have to make some compromises."

4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Google Home Mini is great. Bulb is basic.,"Pro Easy setup Faster response Con Short range Not that bright and yellow Must be paired to either Google Home or GE’s app Limited integration This is mostly a review on the C-Life and its functionality so I won’t go to much into the Google Home Mini. I’ll just say that the Mini is a great device, with a good speaker and can be linked to various smart devices. I'm only recommending this because you’re getting a great device with the Mini and get a bonus bulb to try out. The C-Life bulbs are basic and are better suited to smaller homes or those who are not smart home enthusiasts. They’re dimmable but the light gives off a warm yellow tint, and isn’t very bright. They are only a little cheaper than the better C-Sleep bulbs. They also do not integrate with any other smart home systems like SmartThings, Wink, Apple HomeKit, or IFTTT. And even though it’s bluetooth, you can only pair with the Google Home or your phone (not both). There are some advantages of choosing the bluetooth C-Life bulbs over the standard smart bulbs (WiFi, ZigBee, or Z-Wave). It’s easier to set up, has a faster response time, and the bulbs are a bit cheaper. However they have a much shorter range and requires the controlling device (either the phone or Google Home) to be close by. According to their FAQ, multiple bulbs form a mesh that help relay the commands to each other and having multiple Google Home devices is more efficient. The setup with Google Home was very simple. You don’t need the GE app since everything can be done through the Google Home App, without needing their C-Reach Hub. Once connected, you can control it with Google Home and any device compatible with Google Assistant (phones, android TV, speakers, etc.). Through the Google Home App, you can turn on/off, dim, and setup routines and schedules. The routines settings are a little buried within the menus but you shouldn’t have to access these very often. Really it’s the Google Home App that gives these bulbs better functionality. While I recommend the Google Home Mini, I can’t say the same for the C-Life. It’s just not good enough on its own. It may get better if they come out with more products that work with other systems."

4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Inexpensive cost of entry to ""smart"" home tech","The Google Home Mini and GE light bulb kit represent a relatively inexpensive way to test out ""smart"" home tech to see if you're going to like it. My house is already pretty well integrated (or inundated!) with smart things but I decided to give this a try to see if it's something my parents and in-laws--who are all technophobes--might be comfortable using. The setup is fairly straight forward and went off without any complications. I stayed away from the GE app setup based on other reviews and the fact I wanted to be able to have control of this bulb when away from home. Unlike all of my other smart stuff, the GE bulb is not WiFi connected, but rather uses Bluetooth so placement is key. It will only connect to Google-branded devices, so keep that in mind. In theory, the bulbs are supposed to be able to create their own mesh-type network to extend placement options, but I only have the one so I can't comment on that functionality. On the plus side, there's no need to have a separate hub so that helps keep your costs (and clutter) down. Anyway, the Home Mini works like any other Google Home speaker, just in a smaller package. The sound quality is acceptable for what it is, just don't expect room-filling sound. The bulb can be controlled by voice to turn on or off or you can dim from 100% to 1%. The color temperature is not adjustable, it just is what it is. The light is pleasant enough but it sometimes leaves me wishing it was a tad brighter. All in all, this is a solid entry-level device kit that works pretty well. For me, it's a little too basic, but it's exactly what my parents and in-laws would be comfortable using.Less"

You can do everything with the Mini Chalk that you can with the ‘Home’ except raise the level of the sound fidelity to that of the Google Home or Home Max. The rationale for obtaining a “Home Mini” instead of a “Home” or “Home Max” is cost and thus affordability, for this device is inexpensive enough to buy for every room of the house or apartment. Like all of Google’s smart home devices, this smart speaker is a lot of fun, seriously ‘cool’, and very easy to setup. BTW: Google’s “Home”, “Home Max” and “Home Mini” smart speakers install and work exactly the same way so if you also come across my review of them, you may notice considerable similarity. So long as you have a nearby power outlet, a Google login, a smartphone to load the “Google Home” app, and a home wireless router within range, the voice activated Google “Home Mini” personal assistant will be a breeze to install and use. Once it is setup, it’s “Look ma, no hands”. All I had to say was “Hey Google” and fire-off a question or command.

The mini has the same functionality as the Google Home but in a sleeker and compact design. The smaller design allows it to easily blend into any décor without being noticeable. Physical setup is extremely easy, just open the box, put in on the table and plug it in. Google has also made the software setup very easy and straightforward. However, you will need a smartphone/tablet and a Gmail account. From your smartphone just download the google home app and run it. The app will ask a few questions, have you sign in then automatically detect and connect the mini to your house Wi-Fi. Last step will be to train your voice so the mini can identify you. At this point you are setup and ready to start using the system. Just as the original Google Home you can ask any questions, set timers, get directions, hear the news or the weather, order food or even control your in-home smart devices. It even has integration into your smart phone, allowing you to make calls directly from the mini. If choosing between the mini or the larger google home the only difference will be in the smaller compact design and the speaker quality, functionality is the same.

I’ve heard that these can be easily hacked. You do have to put your home address in the initial set up & it does have a microphone, however the is an option to shut it off. Only time will tell how much I use this. The light bulb feature is nice, but how many can you use and most importantly, how expensive are they? Otherwise I like it!Less"

I have used the Amazon Echo Dot and have made a few comparisons herein. PROS: At a high level the Home Mini does everything that the Home Hub and and the Home Max deliver with Google Assistant. Sounds better than the Echo Dot (comparatively better range, richer sound). I like the appearance with the fabric cover and color options available. The Home Mini is a very affordable entry smart home hub that can integrate with Internet of Things (IoT) devices (i.e. TP-Link, Philips Hue, Wemo, etc. or anything compatible with Google Assistant. FEATURES / EXPERIENCE: You can place a call free phone call, stream music through music apps like Pandora, Spotify, YouTube Music, etc. Easy integration with Google Chromecast and use voice command to launch YouTube. Netflix, etc. to your TV. You can send the Mini audio to other speakers with Bluetooth. CONS: Touch controls are not intuitive. The Mini does not have a 3.5mm auxillary output jack like the Echo Dot. The indicator lights on top are not easy to see from a distance (unlike the light ring on the Echo Dot) SUMMARY: The Home Mini significantly lacks in sound quality and speaker capabilities compared to the Home Hub or Home Max. That should be expected with the considerable lower price point. Because of this it should supplement an anchor speaker to the Home Hub or Home Max in your Google Home platform.

5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Living up to expectations,"It was a choice between this and the other well known one and I chose this because of the speaker sound quality which I must say is pretty good considering its size. Nice even bass and clear treble. It also goes very loud but I find the clarity distorts slightly if I do that but it's loud enough anyway even if not on full. You tap the sides to raise/lower the volume. A long press on the side can pause/stop playback. You can also tell the AI to lower the volume by xx% or pause playback etc. The AI (Google Assistant) is still learning and like all similar smart speakers it will take a while for you it to learn how to respond more accurately and what you can say to it to get a more accurate response. It can be a little bit frustrating having to repeat yourself a few times but I must say it seems fairly intuitive and quickly learns. More schemes are being added to it so you can add more connected gadgets. It doesn't have as many as its rival but it's slowly getting there. You can switch off the mic on this so that's great for us security minded people. I have yet to link another speaker via bluetooth but have it linked to my Chromecasts and a cheap wifi plug with no issues at all. I would like it if the AI could be switched to only recognising my voice and no other and possibly changing its name so that my phone and tablet don't spring to life when they hear the 'OK Google' phrase (the facilities may be there already but I haven't found them yet). I have now started telling it good morning which will give me a rundown of my schedule and the day's news highlights. I also tell it good night and enjoy hearing it say something silly like 'good night, up the stairs to Bedfordshire' or something equally amusing. On the whole I'm glad I bought it and would consider getting another for other rooms.Less"

5.0,a year ago,lowes.com,Google Home Control + Speaker,"You're considering a dive into home automation. The question that arises is where do I start. You can get intelligent lightbulbs, switches, outlets, thermostats, and TVs. Your ability to use these devices, however, is limited to how you can interact with them. If you want to use the Google Home infrastructure, the first interface is going to be your Android or iOS device. While control mechanism works, it is somewhat cumbersome (I've been doing it that way for a year). Enter Google's Home Mini. Essentially, the Mini adds two additional features - the ability to speak commands and to listen to results without having to fumble for your cellphone or tablet. As a byproduct, it also adds decent audio (albeit a little ""tinny"" when compared to Google's Home, its bigger sibling) to listen to streaming sources on the Internet and a ""coolness"" factor. It also has a limitation your cellphone or tablet doesn't have - the Home Mini has no display. As a result instead of viewing your options on your cellphone, you need to know what's available e.g. know that I have a coffee pot plugged into a Google Home compatible socket that can be turned on/off (pretty easy) or the name and source of a specific musical album. Having said all that, there are times and features that really make voice control of your environment fantastic. While I can't say I couldn't live without it, it CAN BE very convenient. By the way, in case you're interested, the time to install (with a pre-existing wifi network) from removing the plastic wrapper to my first command (""Hey Google, play some jazz."") was about 7 minutes. Not bad for a new install!Less"

It is really convenient when your hands are full or you do not want to get up to turn off the lights. You can also have the google home dim the lights or make them brighter. The google home mini can also do many other things, like set an alarm for you, play music, or even tell you the weather. The one thing we did not like about the smart bulbs with the google home is that if we accidentally pulled the string on the ceiling fan for the light switch, it would cause connection issues with the google home. Then the only way to fix this was to unpair the light bulbs from the app, factory reset the light bulb (following a sequence of turning the lights on and off), and then re-add the light bulbs to the app. It can be a pain to do this when you have 3 light bulbs for one ceiling fan, but it is fairly simple to fix.Less"

Lack of brief mode (Alexa devices can be set to respond with brief answers or just a simple DING! to confirm...and baby stays asleep). Also I feel like you should be able to enable calling on these devices ONLY when it detects specified voices. That way my kids can't say ""Hey Google (or Alexa!)

It detects and hears commands fairly far from where it is situated which is pretty cool.

I find myself using the app to turn down volume or use other features. I feel the voice recognition is more difficult and often doesn’t hear my voice over the highest volume setting. The music seems to have more treble than basic you don’t get a clear, solid sound from speaker. Pros: while I don’t use the features, I feel it is much more expandable to house devices and connected devices.

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Smart Home Tech for Less,"I purchased this Smart Home Starter Kit on a promotion. The promotion was to purchase this kit (1 google mini & 1 smart bulb) for $35 (regularly $55), and you would receive a 2pk of smart bulbs (value $25) for free. So a savings of $45 - and you ended up with 3 smart bulbs and a google mini. I already had a google mini at home to add this to; and purchased an additional 2 pk of lights to meet my needs to ""start"" my smart home upgrade. I did extended research on smart lighting options available before selecting this one. I appreciated that it did not require a bridge/hub or extra equipment. You can plug in the GoogleHome and screw in the light bulb - they work over wifi and bluetooth (with the corresponding app). Set-up was a breeze, as the app walks you through all the steps. The only ""downside"" to the lower cost / no extra equipment needed option is that these lights do not come in any color other than ""standard"". I will say that initially I felt these lights were much more yellow / less bright than the HE lights I had been using prior. And while, I still think this is true to some degree - it is not dark by any means, and I have become acclimated to the new hue. I also was concerned as I was planning to replace 2 3-way bulbs in 2 separate fixtures; however being able to set the lighting at 5%, 50%, 99%, etc (anywhere in between) actually has given me better control of the lighting at any given time. I.e. I tend to lower my light to 30-40% while doing late night tv watching; or leave a light at 25% for my return if it's late at night. (I'm very pleased that I can turn the lighting on from outside my home, in case I forgot to leave a light on / or return later than intended. I don't have to walk in to a dark home - and thats is a wonderful perk). You do not ""need"" a Google Mini in each room - you can run lighting from different rooms on one mini, but the rooms can't be extraordinarily far from one another. ( I personally live in an apartment - and was using my living room Mini for my living room, dining area and bedroom until my second mini came in (it was on back order). I personally I like having a Mini in each room , as I have set up a ""speaker group"". I have it set so that my morning routine will be read throughout the apartment. (Have it set to give me temp/weather for the day, my calendar updates, and read through 4 different news options.) -- This way when I start the routine in bed, I can go about starting the coffee pot, brushing my teeth, etc - basically anything I need to do and hear the news (music, etc) throughout my home. I will say that you can NOT use the CE lighting app for lighting schedules; IF you use the Google app for the Mini's.One or the other. -- I prefer the google app because of how it integrates lighting to the daily routines (Good Morning, turns on all the connected lights in my home ; where as ""Bedtime"" turns of all the lights except for the one on my nightstand, etc). You can set limitless options for routines; and they are the greatest perk for me of the ""smart home system"". I would highly recommend this product - especially if you are need of a Google Mini. Even at the retail of $55, it is a good deal for the Mini & one bulb. I would suggest getting additional bulbs, and spending the time to learn how to best use the Mini and it's available routines when purchasing. The more I was aware of the functions/options, the more I use device&lights, and the more value I see in the overall system."

FEATURES: The Bluetooth ""C App"" allows you to create custom set-ups for waking up or for early evening hours. The bulbs can also automatically switch from more intensity in the day to softer tones at night - or vice versa. CONS: Limited options and too simplistic with the GE ""C app"".

4.0,a year ago,lowes.com,Let there be light,"This mini in this combo package is not different than buying the mini separate, it has all the same functionality as any of the other Google Home products. Smart home control, Q & A, weather, directions etc. Once installed, you can control the light via your voice. By saying turn on, turn off or even dim the light. The google mini is small and well designed so that it will fit unnoticeable into the décor of any room. Setup is very easy, find a spot, plug it in, download the app and off you go. You will need a google account to go through the setup, but it’s extremely fast and easy to get going. Google couldn't have made this any easier to setup. The google mini can be purchased separately or in this combo pack with the light bulb. Additional blubs can be purchased and added to the system. Each light is given a name and placed into a room. This gives you the ability to control the light by name or by room. Examples, Hey Google turn on the fireplace light. This will turn on the individual light named fireplace. To turn off all the lights in a specific room you would say hey google turn off the kitchen lights. And of course you have the ability to turn off all the light in your house with one voice command. In addition, these lights a dimmable and the mini lets you adjust the brightness in a percentage. As an example you can tell google to set the lights to 20%. Although the ability to voice control lights is great, there is a downside. If you are like me and have a habit of flipping off the light switch when you leave a room, you will essentially kill the power to the lights and disable the ability of the mini to control them. Obviously if you flip the light switch to off, you have cut off the power to the light, therefore the google mini will not have the ability to turn the light back on until you restore the power. This can be annoying if you or others are in the habit of flicking the switch. To gain both manual and voice control perhaps a smart wall switch might be a better solution. Overall the system works great with almost no lag time, it takes about 2 seconds between the time you tell it to turn on/off the lights till execution. The light itself is fairly bright and as mentioned before can be dimmed down. For those looking for the ability to voice control only your lighting this is a good solution. If you want both manual and voice control, I would look to using one of the google home products with a compatible wall light switch."

It was easy to set up with Google Assistant already on my phone and works great with voice commands. The speaker itself has a really good sound for the occasional, causal music listening.

4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Good mini, less good bulb","It's billed as a starter kit, and that's what it is. For ""smart"" lights, this is about as barebones as you get. You can remotely dim, but not change either the temperature or the color of the light. In setting up the kit, you're prompted to use Google Home, which is appropriate for the mini, and it seems to already know that you're setting up the light as well. However, using the Google Home app on iOS, you don't have the ability in app to do anything with the bulb other than unpair it. GE does have a separate C-life app, but it was unable to find the bulb, probably because it had already paired with the Google Home setup. To try to get to any additional features that may (or may not) be available through the GE app, I would have had to reset the bulb through a complicated series of timed power cycles of the light, and I wasn't willing to do that just to try pairing with a different app. Through Google Home, you have to use voice commands to dim or brighten the light. The nice thing is that you don't need a separate hub for the light, the Google mini is all the additional hardware you'll need. On its own, the Google mini is great because it gives you access to the Google assistant and the wealth of smart home features that provides, especially if you associate it with your Google account and use the calendar.

I bought this to compare it to the Amazon echo, a product I use now. Google home mini has some nice advantages compared to the Amazon echo, the voice recognition seems to be a lot better and it's better at picking up your voice in a noisy environment. It also just looks a lot nicer. However, the software, Google Home, used to manage this device is just awful. The Google Home app has almost no gui tools to work with a smart home environment, for some strange reason Google wants you to use your voice commands to set this up. This is done by asking google home mini to scan for new devices and then you can manage them through additional voice commands, but if you haven't configured your device names with the specific intention of using voice control you have a major problem. I for example have a light in your living room named LightWallLeftLRoom, you can imagine the problems getting a voice recognition system selecting this device. For Amazon echo I can set up routines using the Alexa app gui, which gives me easy visual access to administrate my smart home devices. Using routines i can connect the voice commands i want to use to the devices i want to manage, for example i have a routine called ""Good night"" which turns off all lights and media center devices. I know Google is implementing something similar, but for now it's only available to the US as far as i can find.

Upon opening the app, I saw a banner asking me to ""Setup 1 Device"". 2. The app walked me through setting up the Google Home Mini first. 3. The app then automatically asked me if I wanted to setup the bulb. It quickly found the bulb and added it to my Google Home profile. [[ Performance ]] I have a mix of both Amazon's Alexa and Google Home at my house and I find that the Google Home is a little better at understanding my voice commands and a little quicker at responding. I was pleasantly surprised at the sound performance of the Home Mini's speaker. It's definitely better than the Amazon Echo (2nd generation) with decent minds and highs and a tiny bit of bass. Listening to Pandora was definitely doable and sounded a lot better than my iPhone's built-in speakers.

However, the bulb connects via Bluetooth, which limits its range compared to other wireless connections such as WiFi, Zwave and Zigbee. Therefore, the Google Home Mini and the GE smart bulb should be located in the same room (or the next room over) to avoid communications issues. [[ Features ]] The GE smart bulb does what most smart bulbs do: turns on and off and dims from 0% to 100%. Unfortunately, the bulb only outputs a ""daylight"" color temperature only and cannot change to a warmer (or colder) white color. It is also not a multi-color bulb, so you can't change it to ""red,"" for example. The Google Home Mini can do a lot more than control this one bulb. It can give you the weather, check your calendar, control other smart home products (like Philips Hue and Samsung SmartThings), play Pandora and much more. Unfortunately, the bulb included with this kit will not work with an Amazon Echo and it requires a separate hub to work with Alexa. [[ Value ]] Whether you're just getting started with a smart home or you're converting from Alexa to Google Home (or maybe maintaining both?), this starter pack is a quick and easy way to jump into home automation. The setup process is very easy thanks to the Google Home app's awareness of the Google Home Mini and smart bulb combo and the app easily walks you through the process of getting both up and running."
5.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,12 and counting...,"So much you can do with the Google Home Minis. I currently have 12 installed, with plans to add at least 2 more. I have multiple routines setup to control Philips Hue LED lights. Three speaker groups: one upstairs, one downstairs, and one for the entire house. I stream Pandora to as many as all 12 minis at the same time and have not noticed any sync issues, although on occasion there may be a few seconds where one will play gibberish, but returns to normal by itself in a few seconds. I also have one connected to a mobile battery pack so I can use it where it is not practical to run a power cord and it's mobile anywhere in the house. I'm probably going to do that with one or two others where cords can be a problem. I'll even be adding one in the garage to play music and allow me to broadcast messages to the entire house.Less"
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Perfect little assistant,"My son bought this for me as a gift. Initially I didn't think I would use it very often but I use it alot. I have it in my kitchen and I use it for recipes, weather, music. I get a little frustrated when I don't have my phone readily available to cast my music bc most of my selections are only available in Google Music, I haven't taken the time to check into subscribing to Google Music but it's not really that big of a deal to me. I don't have much trouble finding music I like and I can cast anything. I love the black color, it blends into the background on my backer's rack, you don't even know it's there. The sound is fine for quick music. I recommend getting the larger version if you are wanting a better sound or plan to use it as your main music speaker source. I liked it so much that I bought my mom one. Definitely recommend.Less"
4.0,a year ago,lowes.com,Great home automation starter unit!,"Google - Smart Light Starter Kit with Google Assistant The Google smart light starter kit with Google assistant is a great entry point into the smart home movement. It comes with a Google home mini and a GE C-life dim-able led smart light bulb. If you’re just starting out or are expanding your lighting devices, this is a good bargain. The Google mini is a very clean and modern looking device that takes up little space on the night stand. The speaker is fair, but not great. (If you want to listen to music on the speaker with any real fidelity, you will want to get the full-size Google home or the Google home max.) However, for listening to voice responses, alarms, or audio books, the Home Mini's speaker works just fine. Where it really shines, is that you can now control the included light bulb with your voice. I replaced the standard light bulb in my nightstand lamp, and am able to turn it on, off, or dim it with just a voice command. Feels kind of like stepping into a Star Trek episode and telling the computer to turn the lights on. The GE C-life bulb connects to the Google mini assistant via Bluetooth, so the Google mini has to be in close proximity to the bulb for it to work, the package recommends within 50 feet. All in all, it is a good purchase and getting both devices in a starter kit really maximizes the savings.Less"
1.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Unusable without a compatible device,"This came free with purchase of a 3rd Gen Nest Smart Thermostat, otherwise I would not have purchased it OR would have to return it if I did. I researched the Google Home Mini Smart to see how or if I could still use it…NO! Why? It can only be paired with a Smart Phone or compatible tablet for remote usage. Because Google indicated it could be used remotely, to turn smart lights on/off, smart thermostats, etc by Smart Phone (I don’t have or want a Smart Phone) or Tablets (not all tablets though). I thought perhaps I could still use it with my PC…NO, I can’t! So, if you don’t have a COMPATIBLE smart phone or COMPATIBLE tablet, do not buy the Google Home Mini. Anyone want to buy mine? I could be wrong about the above, but I spent the better part of a day researching the possibility of using it only to find I can’t.Less"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,A great starter kit,"If you don't have any experience with the ""smart home"" stuff that's all the rage and want to give it a try, this is a great starter kit. The bulb included is a GE C-life bulb that connects via bluetooth to your phone (with the GE app) or to the Google Mini. Together, the two devices will get you up and running to voice control a light in your house. The longest part of the process is probably installing the Google Home app and setting up the Google Mini. After that, the setup and connection of the GE bulb to the Mini could not have been easier. I followed the instructions to get the bulb connected, gave it a name I'd remember, and was immediately able to tell Google to turn it on and off. If you want to be able to control the light when you're away from home you'll need a $50 C-Reach device that connects the bulb to your Wifi. If you have that, then you could also use Alexa (with a Skill download) to control the light if you want to see if you like Google or Alexa better. Keep in mind, though, if you decide to get a lot of different devices besides bulbs (smart plugs, switches, sensors, etc.) then you might be better off going with a hub like Wink, SmartThings, Amazon Echo Plus etc. and getting devices that use Wifi, Zwave, or ZigBee rather than the C-life line of products. For the price, though, this is a great way to test the smart home waters. It's extremely simple to set up and see if it's something you think will be useful. I'm pretty sure you'll wonder how you ever lived without it (and Google is probably betting on that happening).Less"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Sound not the greatest, but brains are everything","The Google Home Mini is not what I would consider a ""quality speaker"". It's got a slightly louder, deeper sound than the Echo Dot but it's not something I would use to listen to music for long periods of time - think of it more as a podcast engine rather than for high-fidelity sound. The real reason you should buy this, and without question I would recommend this, is for what it really offers: a window into all the amazing tasks the Google Assistant has to offer. It can do all the things Siri and Alexa can, but it also does so much more - its natural language processing makes it so much more flexible to make requests and queries, and it taps into the biggest knowledge base available - Google! This means it answers questions so much more readily than the other two major voice assistants can. Today I asked, very poorly, ""Hey Google - how long does it go between World Cups?"" Despite the fact that this sentence literally makes no sense, Google understood I was asking what the timeframe was between World Cups and told me the answer. It's brilliant, and it gets smarter every single day. At the time of my review, it makes great speakerphone calls, it sends broadcast messages to all your other Google devices, and it can understand up to three commands given in a single sentence. That's pretty amazing. And when you buy multiple Google Home products - we have two Minis and a normal Home - they all play music or news simultaneously in a sort of surround sound mode. And we use our Google Homes to control our home devices like our TV entirely by voice! An incredible device, and definitely an accessible gateway into the smart home future.Less"
5.0,a year ago,Target,Great Light Kit and Smart Home Upgrade,"I really enjoy the Google Smart Light Starter Kit. It has been a great addition to our home and is the first ""smart"" home product we have installed. I like how the Google Home Mini is included in the kit allowing you full access to everything that product offers with the added convenience of easily adjusting the lighting in a room. It took me about five minutes to get everything up and running which included the time needed to install the Google Home app since I didn't already have it. Instead of wasting energy with our large overhead light, I am able to adjust the lamp with the included GE C-Life smart light . The bulb is great because the dimness can be adjusted a simple command to the Google Home Mini. I work from home a lot, so I like being able to be across the room on my laptop but adjust the light or turn it on as the outside light changes. It's also nice to be able to turn off the lamp as I'm heading to bed at night without having to cross the room to turn it on or off. I put the GE smart light on a basic lamp and love how the bulb allows it to now be a dimmable lamp. It's a next generation version of the old sound activated lamp controllers. The smart light says it has a life expectancy of over 13 years, so I look forward to being able to use this for many years to come. The Google Smart Light Starter Kit is an excellent product and I look forward to adding these to other rooms in my home.Less"

Google serves as my office assistant and helps increase my efficiency in getting work accomplished. Through voice control, I am using it to set reminders and alarm notifications. Google provides me with real-time news updates or relaxing background music upon request. On top of that he is polite. I am able to turn my desk lamp on or off, as well dim and brighten the light, via my smart phone or through voice command.

Controls are even easier. We connected ours to Pandora, and I've found that while it works, it can be a touch hard to maneuver and get exactly what you want. I have used the free Goolge Play Music as well, and that seems to work seamlessly. We have just one Mini currently, but are looking to expand to provide coverage in common areas in our home.

4.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Hey Google...not bad.,"Hey Google? Alexa? Truthfully they both work great. What stands out is that I am a Google lover. I have Youtube Red and Google Music and I have to say this is the reason why I prefer Google over Alexa. Sound quality is much better on the Google Home Mini vs the Alexa Dot 1st gen. The voice of the AI is less robotic and you get the option of changing to different voice types. Home automation works as expected. The one thing I wish you could change on the Google Home Mini is that when you have it shut off your lights it doesn't announce that 2 lights were turned off. Alexa will just ding which I prefer. Also I wish you could control the volume level of the AI voice so that when you have the volume set for music it didn't inherit the same level. Want to scare your partner, tell Google to shut off the lights and have it announce at level 7 the light is now off. In summary, AI is here to stay. Is it the best? Probably not. Is it good for what we need? Yes. Especially if you subscribe to the Google Universe and get Google Music and Youtube.Less"
1.0,a year ago,John Lewis,A REAL disappointment,"I have been using Amazon Echo Home Mini units for some time, and really enjoyed them and the convenience. Having programming experience I have been able to add new functions to 'my' ALEXA, and the Echo Home Mini also functions well with my home automation equipment. However I had long wanted to move to Google as I am heavily invested in Google Services for Email, Calendar, Music, Video etc etc. So I decided to finally purchase one to try out. Thank Goodness I only purchased one!!! Whilst the audio quality is remarkably good from such a small device, and the add on's you can install are solid (including allowing interfacing with the aforementioned home automation) there is a MASSIVE gotcha. I pay for Google services, as I do not want the tracking which comes with the free services. This is a service from Google known as G-Suite and is mostly used in Business, but some tech clued-up people pay for the service on their phones and accounts also to avoid the tracking (which we are all aware of). Potential purchasers of this item should be aware it WILL NOT WORK with Paid-For Google services!! Whilst my Amazon Echo devices can access my Google G-suite calendar, the Google Home devices will not. Shockingly! I discovered online after purchase I am not the only one to have these issues and many who pay for Google services are now getting rid of these Google devices. Many reviews rave about them, but it seems they are not often tested with the G-Suite service. It is almost offensive we pay for Google software services which are not compatible with Google devices. I'm gifting this one to a friend who uses Google Free services, with which it will work. I will personally be staying with the Amazon Alexa systems. I could not recommend this Google device to anyone who pays for Google services though, it will NOT work. Amazon Alexa devices are a better bet in that case.Less"

Carefully following the directions I couldn’t get it to ever find the light bulb after trying it in three different rooms and three different lamps. I also attempted to play Spotify music (another app download) but that too was a wasted effort. I finally gave up and let my daughter (the technical genius) try it. She too struggled but after working diligently for an hour she did manage to get it to turn on the light. I’m sure many people do have success with it, but I’m going back to my Alexa Echo."

It also assists me when I’m cooking setting timers, making a shopping list for your groceries, it helps you search the web, play music, and more. Who doesn’t want all that. At the end of the day, we want comfort and relaxation wherever we are. The mini definitely does that. I don’t need to lift a finger to do all these task and the mini does all the work for me. It also serves as security since sometimes I come home late, I can turn the lights on while I’m away. This is probably the main reason why I love this assistant.

4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Good product, but it won’t make me leave the Echo","Let me start by saying that I have a number of Alexa devices, including 3 of the 1st gen Echo, and couple of 1st gen of the Dot, a couple of 2d gen Dot, and a Spot. I’ve been pretty happy with them as we’ve built our Smart Home capabilities, but was interested in trying out the Google Home Mini after getting a recommendation from someone in the family. When the right sale price came along, we took the opportunity to pick one up at Best Buy. The Google Home Mini is an attractive, small smart speaker; it is really much nicer looking than both the 1st and 2d gen Echo Dot (I don’t have a 3d gen, so can’t do a side-by-side). It is very responsive; in fact, I’d say it is slightly more responsive than any of the Echo products. It “speaks” clearly, but I think the voice sounds a little more artificial than that of the Echo. In the “smarts” department, I haven’t asked it anything it stumbled over yet. I wouldn’t recommend it as a primary means to listen to music, but then I don’t find playing music on the Echo devices to be very appealing, either. They’re both fine for short periods of listening. Overall, I’m glad to have had the opportunity to try the Google Home Mini, but I don’t find enough value added to want to abandon our Echo devices. Honestly, if Google had been first out of the gate with a smart speaker, I would probably feel the same way about abandoning their products. It’s good to have choices, and I think you just have to decide which “universe” you’re most comfortable in - Google’s or Amazon’s. I don’t think you can go wrong with either at this point.Less"

As I bring more stuff into my environment, Google home seems to grow and help me manage it. Voice and remote lights are cool. They are also dimmable. Here's some skeptical thoughts... The light bulb is smart not the light switch. Way easier to replace and install. However, there is an increased cost to this on per unit basis. The LEDs last longer so that cost is spread out true. My understanding is LED survivability is largely dependent on the circuitry quality. Does putting a Bluetooth help or hurt that outlook? I can only guess.

Of the products out there I've tried I can't say much more than it works and works ok. You want to dip your toes in the Assistant pool, you're not going to go wrong. What I don't like about these is the pickup on all Minis I've ever run into seems to not be as robust as the others. It works, it'll be fine but I'm ""OK Google""ing much more than on other devices. The next is since these have been relegated to kid's rooms (nighttime music, story norey, couple of kid things) getting the volume adjusted via voice is harder on these than any I've used. The others hear the OK Google when the music is too loud, these I generally have to come and whack and I always manage to turn it up even more. Good, not the best, but being the lowest price entry models can't complain. I'd rather get the Insignia on sale when it's $20 or a Lenovo when it's 90 or so. But then again, they're an entirely different class and different base price model.

The speaker is decent for it’s size and you won’t have any issues hearing it in under most conditions. The mini is responsive to your voice and you can just talk normally to interact with it. The GE C-Life smart bulb that comes packaged with it connects to the google mini via Bluetooth. I was able to connect it to my Google Home (not mini) that I had already and set up was easy and straight forward. It is recommended that the bulb be close to the google mini for the pairing to take hold. I had them about 25 feet apart and I didn’t have any issues. The GE bulb is a warm color and that is the only color that it projects. Their other bulbs, the C-Sleep will go from Warm to Cool, but again, this one will not. I find that to be a minor annoyance, but I am sure there is a marketing reason for that. This set up will allow you to dim the light and turn it off and on. I haven’t found a way to set up a schedule in the google assistant app, but if you use the C by GE app then you have more control over that, but Google home mini is the recommended way to use this since they are paired together in this package. I have not had any issues with connectivity at all, and the light has always responded to my commands. This is a good way to get started out if you don’t already have a Google device.

5.0,3 months ago,lowes.com,A great way to learn about Home Automation,"I felt like this was a great way to dip into finding out how to start setting up my home as a smart home. I love it! I can control my light with either my voice, if I am at home, or I can control it via the google app on my iphone. I can also control the brightness from 0-100%. I felt that the setup was a breeze; I just plugged in the Google Home Mini, screwed in the GE C-Life bulb in a light fixture I wanted to control via through the google app I downloaded on my phone. The app actually walks you through the setup process. The Google Home Mini is not limited to just the GE C-Life bulb but you can access daily news headlines/stories, the weather, listen to music, set alarms, its abilities seem endless. I am still learning new things every day of what it can do."

It seems to work great and have the same basic functions as the regular Google home. I changed the voice so now John Legend answers our questions, tells us jokes, gives me the forecast, etc haha. We found it on sale at Walmart Black Friday for only $15 and we are very pleased! It is small so it takes up little to no space, which makes it more appealing in my opinion.

4.0,4 months ago,lowes.com,Great product if you can live with the open mike,"This thing is pretty slick, and I haven't even used all the features yet. The light control feature works well (from the hub or from my phone) and the hub integrates well with other wireless devices, like my TV and wireless thermostat. Google does not include a users' manual, but the Google Home app is reasonably intuitive and steps you through the setup process. The drawback to this technology is an open mike to Google. There's no way around this. Google assures me that it uses its technology strictly for voice commands, but at the end of the day I have to take their word for it. And though it does some neat stuff in response to voice commands, it's no substitute for a dog."

They go anywhere, have amazing voice recognition, super easy to use as whole home speaker system (even with as many zones as you want), low price point, and work with almost everything these days. Overall, the whole family is happy with them, and prefer the VA to Alexia which we were using for about a year. The family had very limited adoption of Alexia due to the voice recognition, it was good but just not good enough to make it quick and easy to use. However, now with Google Home the whole family is using them for everything from Turing lights on and off, to music & speakers, to playing games. It's been a great change and great utility for our a home."
1.0,a year ago,Best Buy,It's awful.,"Open music with something like Tidal on my phone, go into the Google Home screen and click ""Play music"" on this and... it starts playing some completely random music from somewhere else. Nothing I own or have or want to hear. Tell it to play music and you'll get a phrase you'll start to hate very quickly telling you that you need Youtube premium or something to play music and here's something different on Google Play Music. If you give in and start using Google Play Music it gets about 5% better. If you try to use it to play your existing music collection it can't. Even if the collection is on your phone. It won't even try. It *has* to stream from Google's servers or the world will explode. So Google give you the option to upload your entire music library to their servers. So you can download it eternally through streaming it over and over again. Even though the Mini has to be set up on a home network with both Bluetooth and Wifi and either of those can stream music. I gave in and tested it. 3gb uploaded. After that telling it top play a certain song, that was on that list I'd uploaded usually ended up in the same error and random crap playing instead. The Google Support way to make it better was to create a playlist in Google Music and name it, then call that name to play it. I named it ""My Stuff"". To play a certain song you'd have to say something like ""Hey Google, play Bullet in the Head by Rage Against the Machine from my My Stuff playlist on Google Play Music."" And 95% of the time no matter what you say you're going to get a speech twice that long about how you should pay them to use this service better and here's some random banjo music instead. Oh, and watch out if you have multiple accounts on your phone, like people often have. The devices in Google Home have repeatedly decided that none of my accounts is the owner of the home they're in, and I've had to delete the home and restart after factory resetting them 3 times in one month. The Mini is on my desk unplugged, again. That's it's normal state, and how it's best enjoyed.Less"
4.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Really good small smart speaker,"The Home Mini offers an inexpensive way to get the Google Assistant into your home. It is very easy to setup through the app, it is the same process as setting up a Chromecast. It takes less than five minutes. After that, it is small and unobtrusive enough that it stays out of your way until you need it for something. It is quick to respond when you speak to it, Really good for talking to your other smart home devices, or just to ask questions. Every once in a while, it won't understand you unless you speak very clearly and deliberately, even when giving a command you have used before without issue. Sound quality is ok for listening to music, but that's not really what it is made for. Overall, a solid choice at a reasonable price."

5.0,a year ago,Target,So Convenient,"The Google Home Mini is really a convenient little device. I'm not going to explain everything it can do but I will touch on key overall features. First off it can operate a lot of smart devices with either voice or through the Google Home app available free through the Play Store via android. It can tell you weather, a joke, play music or create events, it can start Netflix. And once linked to your android account it will post and open things on your phone as far as adding alarms and calendar events. It must be connected to your WiFi for it to work properly. The small statue of the Google Mini means it will fit just about anywhere and it looks nice, it shouldn't be an eyesore for you. Also the speaker is very responsive and picks up voice with ease. Now for the smart light bulb that comes with this set. It is so awesome and handy to have. I have the bulb in my light fixture outside. It is so convenient to be able to control the light from the Google Home app on my phone from the warmth of my car. When I get home most evenings it is dark, all I have to do it turn the light on by the app from my phone. This is so handy because I normally have my hands full of stuff that needs to go into the house, and no room for a flashlight. Also with having pets I can watch my step with the light on, and not worry about stepping in something I shouldn't.Less"

Not only this, I only just discovered the “good morning google” and for my busy lifestyle, I get to keep up with the news and it also tells me what I am meant to be doing each day; fabulous! I moved it to the kitchen to use as a timer, then as a joke I ask “hey google what’s the recipe for meting moments” AND IT HAD THE RECIPE!! Not to mention I could also play music whenever I wanted!!

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,A Better Ecosystem than Alexa,"When the home AI units came out, I had to decide whether to set our home up with Amazon Alexa or Google Home. At the time, Alexa seemed to be the more robust choice. I was already a Prime member, I owned Kindles, so the choice seemed obvious. I set my home up with the Alexa ecosystem. I think I may have made the wrong choice. As you would expect, set up of the Google Home device was easy. The user interface is visually pleasing and fairly intuitive. You can program it for multiple users that have different voices, so that each person can have their own setups individual to them. One of the frustrations I have with Alexa is that if you don’t phrase something EXACTLY, it doesn’t understand. For example, if I said “Alexa, turn off living room lampS,” it wouldn’t understand which light I meant. I set up the item as singular “lamp” so that’s the only way it understands the command. This Google Home unit came with a Smart Light Bulb. When I was testing the Home unit, I asked it to turn on the light as I titled it, just like I would have Alexa. Then I asked it to dim the light, without actually specifying the lamp. With Alexa, I would have had to say the commend in full (“Alexa, dim bedroom lamp.”). With Google, it seemed to understand what I wanted without specifying, AND it understood what I was saying as if I was having a conversation with it. Other than the clunky, “Hey Google,” to get its attention, it seemed to understand me. Alexa is very set in her ways, which can be annoying. Our phones are Androids, and I have an Android-based smart watch, which all have Google Assistant. It may be advantageous for me to switch from Alexa to Home at some point, but for now, it’s a bit cost prohibitive. If you haven’t set your Smart Home up yet, I would advise to really look at Google Home vs. Amazon Alexa.Less"

Having an updated smart home has been a fun adventure offering some unexpected conveniences. The only difference , I believe, between the speakers, is sound quality. But it is a big difference. They all sound pretty good. We listen to a lot of music, audiobooks, and podcasts. We enjoy having a speaker to listen to them. Our 8 year old loves asking the google home to play his favorite songs while he cleans his room or plays with legos. As he was playing legos, he asked it to play the Lego soundtrack and then asked it to play the Lego movie,. He was thrilled to be able to accomplish these tasks without having to ask his older sisters or myself to help him. The speakers are very convenient to ask simple questions, or find out the weather. Simple, lazy things like that. We also just discovered it acts like a intercom system with all the other devices. This feature is very convenient in our 3000 SF home - decreasing the amount of yelling required to communicate with all four of our children. We also appreciate that calls can be made through the google home speakers. This is especially convenient because we do not have a land line and not all of our kids have cell phones. The google home has a great sound. It's a little more bass-y sounding than the mini making it perfect for our living room, get togethers, etc.. All in all a pretty fun device that eliminates the need for other speakers.Less"

Unlike it's Amazon rival, which despite having a seductive name, does not have a captivating design. When I asked Google Home Mini to review itself for the purposes of this review, it actually scored itself 7.33 out of 10. I was surprised by how lifelike the answer was. From this, I discovered that my Google Home Mini is confident with high self esteem, but isn't overconfident or narcissistic. This is exactly the type of personality that I need to guide me through some tricky questions, such as, ""how do you make a lasagna?"" Google Home Mini can tell me about the latest news, change the temperature on my Nest thermostat, manage my day and play me whale music on Spotify before I enter into deep sleep, knowing in my heart that all of my questions have been answered.

While the included instructions are sparse, setup is actually pretty easy. I really appreciate that the C-Life bulbs don't need a hub. They simply operate on your wi-fi. One thing that may not be obvious is that in order to have better control of the bulbs (scenes and such), you should download the C-Life App on your phone or tablet. Through the Google Home App, you can control basic functions such as on/off and dimming, but you cannot set scenes. If you already have a Google ecosystem, the C-Life bulbs integrate perfectly fine. I added one to a bedroom that had two smart lights from another manufacturer, and all three are easily controlled through the Google Home Mini located in the room. While I have not tested the bulb with Alexa, my understanding is that it also works with Alexa if you have a GE C-Reach Bridge. No bridge or hub is needed with Google. In short, particularly for folks interested in using Google Home or have an existing Google Home network, this GE C-Life Smart Bulb Starter Kit is a good value with solid performance.Less"

How some women enjoy looking at pocketbooks or shoes online, I love looking at antique chandeliers, sconces, and, be still my heart, vintage Italian lights by Venini, Sciolari, etc. One thing I've never paid very much attention to though, to my electrician's dismay, has been the functionality of these lights. So, while they may look great, getting them to actually work is an entirely different story. Google's Mini Chalk + GE Smart Bulb is my atonement for all my foolish lighting choices and transgressions throughout the years because it is effortless, incredibly smart (hey, the name doesn't lie), as well as an electric miser's (such as myself) dream come true. Once you plug in the Mini, you simply screw in the light bulb and then download the Google Home app. Yeah, and that's about it. The rest is completely intuitive, as long as you're prefacing your commands with ""Hey, Google,"" that is. Want to turn off the lights without leaving your warm bed? Check! Dim them? Check! Freak out your mother-in-law in the next room by turning the lights on and off repeatedly while she's watching a horror movie with the kids?! Check! (Evil laugh)...

But after successful setup, the speaker is good enough for a small suite, features are interesting; such as playing music from your apps, control of smart Hue lights, and all other daily tasks like weather, news, even reading stories and telling jokes! However, she can hear you 6-7 times out of 10, and don't count on an effective range of 5 m or maybe even less. Does not connect to more than one phone, but others can be invited from the main account as dependant users. Voice is a very good human like.

I have it set up in my bedroom, and its main uses are for answering simple questions, setting alarms, and getting my calendar events from my connected Google calendar account. It also allows you to control smart devices and coupled with the nest thermostat, I can lie in bed and adjust the AC/Heat without getting out of the blankets, which on a cold winter morning, is worth its weight in gold. Only a couple of things which I see need improvement. First, no one has a wall mount available for this, and other than buying some 3M adhesive strips, their is no way to wall mount it. Secondly, if you have more than one of these in earshot, they will both answer. Wish it had a way to differentiate distance and only have the closest reply. This is a feature on my Amazon Echo that I hadn't really noticed until now. All in all, it is a good purchase and at under 30 dollars a real good entry point into the smart home movement.Less"

It's about 4"" diameter by 1.75"" thick. Perfect as a 'hide-away' on the kitchen counter (under the cabinets) or out in the open in the bathroom; I keep mine on the far corner of the long sink space, under the medicine cabinet. It's great for me, when I'm away from my Google Home (in my bedroom), to catch up on news/sports/entertainment & especially listen to my favorite music while in the bathroom (getting ready for work in morning) or kitchen (while cooking or eating). You could really use this in any room though; big or small. It's the mini Google Home that's your mini assistant, connecting you to the world.. playing your favorite song or catching you up on things..even letting you know how the weather is outside..or connecting to your calendar to keep you on schedule.

4.0,a year ago,lowes.com,Google Home Mini Review - Thumbs Up,"Mini Chalk: This is the standard Mini version of the Google Home device. The Mini works well as a speaker and home device. It provides weather, trivia, music, and compares well with all smart home devices. Google is easy to trust with their line of technology products. We have two minis, a Home, and a Home Max in the house. This can be confusing if you're trying to play music as you typically set one device as the primary music speaker. If you're in the bedroom and ask to play music, it will often begin playing in the living room. I'm still trying to figure that out. It could be 'user error'. Pros: Speakers are good. The morning and evening 'routines' are great. You can configure Google to give you weather, traffic, news, play selected music, or none of the above each morning or night just by saying, ""Hey Google - Good Morning or Good Night"". *Good night also asks what time to set your alarm and will play various sleeping music. These features alone make us like this more than the Alexa Dot. You can link multiple music accounts (Pandora, Google Music, Spotify + more) to your Google Device. You do have to be specific when asking it, otherwise it will go to the default setting. Pros: All standard smart home routines work great (similar to Alexa). Morning and Evening routines are really great. Cons: Having multiple devices can sometimes be confusing as to which speaker will play music for you but the sound quality is better than the competitor's products. Having multiple music website choices force you to be specific when asking for a specific song and if your 14 year old daughter makes changes, then it's changed for everyone. >: Ha-ha. Overall: We are really enjoying the Google Home experience. We really enjoyed the Alexa Dot but Google, in typical Google fashion, has extra perks that rate it ahead, in my opinion.Less"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,I Love BOTH of These Devices!,"TECH EXPERIENCE= Advanced Computer Knowledge, Smart Tech Knowledge of connecting 2 Devices prior to this experience = ZERO!! COST = I decided to buy this combination Google Mini and Smartlight Combination, because individually, the Google Mini Cost + a Smart Light Bulb Cost = Was MORE than the combination price cost, and I figured that if I ended up not wanting or not needing the Google Mini, I could just give it away to a family member. Plus, really, you can’t be the combo price. It’s like buying one or the other of them, and then get the other half free. I mean they are both completely stand alone products, that are worth it on their own. === THE SMART LIGHT === Another Great thing about this Smart light, You can immediately use Your Google Device with it, and You don’t have to download any special software App like many of the other Smart Devices. This Smart Light is so easy to install, really, just screw that puppy into your light source and you’re pretty much done. It’s dimmable (or maybe it’s dimmable, because the lamp was dimmable? I don’t know, all I know is that it works! & it Thankfully was a Breeze to install and get coordinated and running with my Google Home. === THE GOOGLE MINI === Here’s a bit of Honest, I elected to use my Smart Light from my Combo Kit with my Google Home that I had recently finally installed after it sat around my home for a good 6mths, almost a year! So, I had finally installed it and fell completely in Love with it. I’m saving my Google Mini to install it in my bedroom after I’ve completed some decorating renovations. I’m going to stop here and point out to those that may not be familiar with Google’s range of devices that a Google Home, is in essence the Same thing a Google Mini is..it’s a little mind boggling when you eventually figure out that be it a Google Home, Google Mini, Google Home Hub, Google Home Max, the software that runs it! Meaning, that everything EXCEPT the visual “Look” of it, are all the SAME!! Ok, one more caveate the Google Hub, unlike the other devices has a the added bonus of having a tablet like screen so it also has the additional functions One would expect of a tablet. Such as, Playing Videos like YouTube, or Slideshows of Family Photos, Watching your Favorite Streaming Service NetFlix, Hulu, Crackle, Crunchyroll, Tubi.TV whatever! THE BAD NEWS= The one thing the Google Hub can’t do (& this makes ZERO Logical sense), is that You can NOT hold video calls! (I mean it’s basically a big phone that you can’t use as a video phone, Seriously?!) So, Basically, all the Google Devices can do the same thing, and use the same software and Apps, Google Home and Google Assistant. And what CAN Your Google Device “DO?” The number of things is simply Amazing! You can: • Play Trivia Games • Check the Weather outside any where in the World! • Track Your Grocery Shopping list without ever having to write anything down! • Listen to Podcasts • Turn On/Off various Smart Applicances and/or Appliaces thanks to Smart Plugs • Turn Up/Down Your Smart Thermostat • Make Phone Calls without Dialing Your Phone • Listen to Audio Books • Listen to Your Spotify, YouTube Music • Make Reservations without lifting a Finger • Hear the Traffic Report for Your regular route to Work & Alternate routes • Listen to White Noise, Falling Rain, Thunderstorms, sounds of the Forest, or Sounds of the Ocean, Etc., all to help You fall softly asleep. • Talk to Symptomate and try to diagnos whatever may be medically wrong with you • Keep Track of Your recent purchases, and their expected delivery dates • Check Your stocks • Control Your Home Security • and so many other both Useful and Useless other activities and actions! SETUP = Took under no time at all! Something like 5 minutes, and that had more to do with my never having used a smart light or another BLE smart device with my google previously. Having now connected multiple devices to my Google, I could install this light in less time it took me to screw the actual light bulb into the lamp. OVERALL REVIEW= I genuinely Love my Google Mini and Smart Light Combo! First, the lamp in which I placed the bulb, is not very easy to reach on a regular basis, so this is a great convenience item for me. I simply say, “Hey Google...” and Ta-Da!, my light is the perfect brightness or a proper darkness, I wish. Also, I can either come in or out of the house completely buried in groceries, packages, or whatever, and all I need do is call out, “Hey Google..” and Wha-La, I can see perfectly in this cave we call a home. To tell you just how much I’m Love both my Google and my Smart Light, I now have Google either installed or waiting to be installed in each room, and I’m currently working on switching out every lightbulb in the house with either smart light bulbs, or smart camera enabled light bulbs! So, Yes! I absolutely RECOMMEND this Fabulous Smart Light and Google’s Devices to Anyone!"

While I do think the smart assistant technologies are not at it's full potential yet, the Google Assistant is constantly improving so it is nice to see when new features are rolled out.

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great mini assistant; surprisingly useful,"I bought on it sale to see what it could do. Having had experience only with Apple’s fairly ignorant Siri, I was initially skeptical. Well, I’m not anymore. This sets up so easily with the Google Home app on your smartphone. It connects easily to your WiFi network. It’s voice recognition rarely fails. Questions you ask it usually produce useful results, though it will occasionally go off on a slightly unrelated tangent. It controls my Philips Smart TV quite well, with the frustration being that it can’t turn it on or off. It won’t play YouTube music to itself since I don’t have a paymium account but it will to the TV. That’s a slight bummer since I have to use a remote to turn the TV on or off. I bought a second one after being pleased with the first. It can’t control a Samsung UHD TV without a ChromeCast 4K that I haven’t got yet. That makes the nice smart features of the TV redundant, but is probably worth it so this little device can control it that way. After seeing how nice this is, I’ll probably be getting more smart devices for my home so this can control them. My only concern might be how vulnerable ones home might become to external hacking.Less"
3.0,a year ago,Currys,Phil's review of Google Home Mini,"Pros: It's a quality device, heavy in the hand, and it's easy to set up assuming you already have a Google account. Cons: Lots not to like. Firstly, it doesn't always respond - if voice control is the only method of interaction, you better be sure that it hears you every time. If not, then you're extending the frustration of technology into your day to day life in a new and extremely irritating way.Secondly, be aware that some users of Google's Play Music service won't be able to listen to their music through this device. Why? No reason, just a bug that has been outstanding for most of 2017 and now into 2018 too.Finally, and most alarmingly, please don't get this device if you have small children. Kids learn from the interactions of those around them. They can't differentiate between a person's voice and a computer's, therefore if they hear you issuing commands to your Google home mini, they'll learn that it's ok to talk like that. I'm genuinely worried that we're creating a generation who won't 'get' interpersonal relationships, and who treat people as objects (for this reason and others, mostly technology related). That's a bigger debate, but fundamentally, this product is of limited use, doesn't work half the time, and brings undesirable behavioural changes into our homes.And before you discount me as some old coot shaking a fist at the moon, I'm a tech professional working for one of the biggest tech companies in the world, so I understand this market better than most.Less"
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Very Nice for the Price,"We receive one of these as a gift for our wedding, as well as the Google Home (with the screen). We loved both. We got a second one for my niece for Christmas. Now this machine has it's clear limitations compared to the home with the screen but for $20, you're clearly winning. The only downfall is that it's limited on music (like how specific you can select your music) unless you pay for YouTube Music. You don't have that limitation with the Google Home which is significantly more money. It's an understandable limitation from Google. Can't give the keys to the kingdom for $20. If you want the best of the best, you have to pay for the best (Google Home). Like i said earlier, you still can't go wrong for $20"
5.0,6 months ago,ebay.com,Google Assistant - great tech and fun!!,"I have a number of Google mini's and Google Home's - great tech if you like this sought of stuff. I prefer Google to Alexa, as I find Amazon's user interface a bit monotone and less engaging. They are very easy and quick to set up. If you want more of a smart speaker with good sound then opt for the Google Home; great sound and bass although its not the loudest. I have a number of smart power outlets and Chromecast dongles - all work faultlessly with Google. Once you get started there are plenty of things you can control from your arm chair. You can also play games, listen to music (not Amazon music), listen to radio, set alarms/timers, ask joke of the day, news updates, ask all sorts of questions. Good fun!!"

Install the bulb into desired socket, plug in the Hub and follow the prompts. It’s really that easy. The thing that stands out most to me about the Google products is that they work as one would expect. I’ve had seamless operation and function from my Google units so far. Very pleased with this product. I’ve added my Honeywell thermostat and my Roomba home vacuum and both respond and operate flawlessly. I’m looking forward to purchasing additional “smart home” products since I feel confident in the functionality of the Google platform."
5.0,a year ago,lowes.com,Google Mini with GE Smart bulb,"The Google Mini came well packaged (to protect), but easy to remove without the use of scissors, knife, or any such thing. Upon opening the box the instructions were immediately on top along with a 'Quick Start Guide'. The Google Mini and the bulb were in their own smaller boxes inside. After a fast read of the Quick Start Guide; I downloaded Google home on my Iphone 6s and found that the app walked me through the complete setup without need for the instructions. It offered many options on set up including renaming the bulb's location and how some things could be set up when asking Google. The bulb can be turned on/off or set to dimness by either percentage/fraction or just asking it to be dimmed. Although, I did find that the brightest setting was lacking in the amount of light that I would have wanted; it did provide enough light to read by and the convenience seemed to make me forget about the want for it to be brighter. The Google Mini itself never seemed to fail in anyway to impress me. No matter what I asked (even if goofy) it gave up the information, had a reply, or suggestions on how I might ask it for a better response. The list of things it was able to offer seems endless and I cannot think of anything it lacked. I found myself wishing I had other things in my house it could control often and am sure that I will be looking into more smart items (bulbs, outlets, etc) to use with it. I would give it a 10 out of 10 on any scale.Less"

It’s so nice to be able to tell google to dim the lights, turn the lights off or on from the convenience of your chair. You can do many things with the google mini. I’ll name a couple of things...ask just about any question and it will answer you. I’ve only found 1 thing so far that it could not answer. You can make phone calls to either someone in your contacts or you can call another google device in the house or google hub. This would be great for an older person to have in their home. If they fall the could easily tell google to call a family member to help them. Both of my children like to have google tell them a jokes. A starter pack for each bedroom will be nice."

While setting it up we realized that if you don't have your own wifi with an accessible password, then you will have to go through the hassle of connecting the device and your phone to the same hotspot and then connecting your phone's bluetooth to the speaker. Of course this isn't a problem for those who have access to a router and private wifi, but for those who don't, for example typically college students living on campus since its mostly public wifi, then you might want to consider whether or not you want to purchase this. The upside is a college student won't be living on campus forever, so it would be smart to invest in this device either way because overall it truly is a great speaker.

4.0,a year ago,lowes.com,Small but Powerful,"I have been playing around with both the google home mini and my mom's Amazon echo dot for a while. about the only thing I preferred the echo over the mini was that the echo picks up you voice better and at greater distance than the mini. probably due to the 7 mic array of the echo vs the 2 of the mini. the google mini wins in many other areas. Google has been gathering data points for years, as a result their speech recognition is excellent. you can speak very naturally with the google home, with Alexa you have to be more precise. also, google allows the creations of shortcuts, basically you can assign a short phrase for otherwise lengthy commands. good example is controlling my harmony hub. if you want to turn off you system (pressing off on remote) you would have to say ""hey google, tell harmony to turn off the entertainment system"". with a shortcut, you would just have to say ""hey google, turn off the tv"". in the next release of the google software you will be able to create ""routines"". basically a shortcut that performs multiple commands. example, ""hey google, good night"" and it would turn off the tv and the lights etc... Voice identification is a good feature if you have kids or are concerned about security. also allows for personalized playlist, calendars etc... I found it too restrictive, about 10% of the time it would not recognize my voice and I would have to repeat several times.Less"

Using the mini hub you can also just ask Google to dim the lights as well. I really like the fact that you don’t need to connect the bulb to any wireless network or go through a lot of steps to set it up as it pairs simply with the mini hub.

4.0,2 years ago,walmart.com,Review of Google Home Mini,"The Google Home Mini is a great electronic device for everyday users interested in using Google’s voice assistant. For this review we will be evaluating the Google Home Mini based on the following criteria; initial setup, sound quality, style, durability, and price. This low-tech device is perfect for any age group who wants to simply stream music, ask questions, or call friends and family hands free. For first time users, the devices setup is timeless and straightforward allowing anyone to setup, personalize, and use their device in no time. The instructions provide a simple outline to follow that eliminates any possible issues when connecting your Google Home Mini to your Wi-Fi or network connection. To initiate the setup, the device requires that you create a google play account and download the Google Home app, but this will help you personalize your specific profile. By doing so, you can connect other apps to the device such as Spotify, YouTube, Netflix, and much more as updates become readily available. These features allow you to play your favorite music, movies, or videos just by simply telling the device to do so. When you ask the Google Home Mini to play something or ask a question, the design allows the sound of the music or voice being played to fill the entire room. The upward facing speakers propel the sound and improves the sounds quality, which enhances the users experience with this device. Compared to the Amazon Echo Dot, the Google Home Mini has an overall better capability to project the sound more clearly, making it easier to hear and accessible to use for older ages. The Google assistant built into the device allows you to change the volume output from anywhere in your house just by saying “Okay google, softer”. You will find that the style of this device fits in with a wide variety of home interior designs. The simple oval shape with the option to pick from three color choices can complement the look of any room in your home. If you are known to drop things, the outer shell of the device does an excellent job protecting the hardware with its strong durability to prevent any damage from occurring. For a low-tech product with high tech qualities, the device is well worth the cost. For around 50 dollars the Google Home Mini is an excellent voice assistant for the everyday user looking to get value out of their product.Less"
5.0,4 months ago,lowes.com,Great device,My family is absolutely horrible about leaving the kitchen lights on. I’ve look into other alternatives. That’s why I’m so glad this came along. I got it and did the installation which was very easy. I’m in love with this now all I have to do is speak to it and I never have to get up to turn that light off again. The kids love it. I placed it in the kitchen. They sit around talking to it and asking all kinds of crazy things. They have a ball with it. I really like it myself. I can ask it the weather for the day and if I have any appointments to play me some kind of music. My 3 month old grandson has got use of it. He was fussy so I ask it to play a lullaby which got his attention pretty quick and he settled down. It’s so much easier to ask this for help then having to run down some device to look this stuff myself. Would definitely recommendLess
5.0,10 months ago,ebay.com,Mini with a mighty punch,"I have trialled both the Google mini and Alexa and Google comes out on top in my book for a number of reasons. We recently went ""smart"" at home with the Philips hue system. We were advised the hue works better with Google home rather than Alexa but decided to put them to the test ourselves. It was instantly apparent that Google home leaves Alexa standing! Not only was Google far more responsive to voice commands than Alexa but also has a superior sound quality when playing music or broadcasts. The sound quality from the Google mini is surprisingly good from such a small speaker; the larger Google home speaker does have a superior sound but for the size and the price the mini is an excellent buy!"

I have a number of smart lights that the mini makes easy to control, and countless times I have asked it random trivia related to a show I’m watching. My only issues with it are, it’s particular about its attention word, sometimes I say it in normal tone right by it and get no answer, other times I can whisper from another room and it’ll hear me somehow. It also occasionally coughs on working with the lights specifically if I say “living room light, blue” it’ll make it literally light blue but of course that’s an excusable issue. Overall good for the price and a worthwhile investment if you are building a smart home or use a lot of google products."

5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Great smart speaker -- works great with Hassio,"I'm using this with the open-source Home Assistant software on a Raspberry Pi running the Hassio distribution. It took a few hours to set that up but it works fine now. Setting up the Google Home mini was very easy in comparison -- just download the app for your phone and connect it to your network. Very simple. I don't have to speak very loud for the Google Home Mini to answer me, just clearly. I haven't had it very long but it's already working out very well. There may be a buzz at the loud volume settings. It could also be vibrating against the wooden table where it rests. I don't know if you could really crank up the music with this speaker. It works well for weather reports and the news. I have it on 50% volume and I can hear it clearly -- it seems to be about a normal voice volume at that setting. I have a regular Google Home downstairs in the kitchen that has a better speaker for music, or I guess you could go for the even larger speaker if you wanted better sound. I'm not trying to say this speaker sounds bad -- it just doesn't cover as large a range as a larger speaker. It is small but does pretty well for its size. It is also heavier than I expected. For my needs, it's great. I can hide it on a shelf under the table by the armchair and I have it set up to turn on the light in the room by voice control. I hope to automate more things, like maybe the window blinds or more electrical outlets. I want to automate my other Raspberry Pi running Volumio. That's a Hassio issue though. Still, it can be done. I can turn on a radio station on Kodi by voice. Hassio really opens up possibilities for this speaker, but you have to be willing to put in the work. It's what I enjoy, though. There are many smart devices that will easily work with Google Home products. They are not as complicated to set up as Hassio, so if this review is putting you off, rest assured that there are other easier ways, if you are interested.Less"

So I bought 4 more so I could do this review. I am quite pleased with everything about them. The installation process was extremely simple once I picked the right way to go about it. Don't use the ""Add -> Set Up Device"" option in Google Home. Even though C Life by GE shows up in the list it doesn't lead to the right installation procedure, at least as far as I could tell. Instead the 5 new bulbs simply showed up in the list of devices for my dining room and one by one I was prompted to do the install. Amazingly easy! The bulbs replaced 5 LED bulbs rated at 75 watts but even though these are only supposed to be 60 watt replacement they seem brighter than the old ones. They work very simply through voice commands as well as through the Google Home app. They also work through the old dimmer switch I had running the old bulbs exactly as the old bulbs did. Even to the point that if I voice dim them with the switch set to full brightness, turn the switch off, then turn it back on they com back at full brightness. This is great for people who don't want to use voice commands. These bulbs really do everything that I could want them to do.Less"
5.0,a year ago,lowes.com,Google Home Mini (chalk),"The Google Home Mini is quite reminiscent of Amazon's Echo Dot. I actually think the Home Mini is more pleasing to the eye, and it fits into most decors nicely. As for its capabilities, it shares the same skills as its larger brothers, the Google Home and Google Max. All share the ability to tell time, set timers, set reminders, tell you the news, weather, traffic and travel time, answer all kinds of questions, play games, control smart devices, i.e. Light bulbs, outlets, switches, tv's, thermostats. The skill sets of the Google Homes devices are growing day by day. Although there are things the Google Home devices can do the Echo devices cannot, the same can be said for Google devices. One that I'm trying to find out if the Google devices can do, is to keep track of package delivery, like the Echo devices can when ordering from Amazon. I am pleased with the Google Mini, and would recommend it to family and friends. I have been looking for a wall or power plate mount for the Google Mini, but none of the ones available from Google or Amazon impressed me with being adequate. I did find on Amazon, some magnetic mounting plates usually used for mounting cell phones in cars via 3m tape.

It's helped make some of our home automation tasks easier as we now have 4 of these scattered around the house and we're able to broadcast a message to the kids downstairs, turn lights on and off, and even have it tell us a silly joke.

4.0,a year ago,lowes.com,A GOOD BASIC START TO THE SMART HOME.,"BACKGROUND: I had been researching the smart home devices and systems but was unsure which company to use. The opportunity to evaluate the Google Home Mini was too good to pass up. By the time is was over we had seven (7) different devices. FIT AND FINISH: I received the Home Mini Chalk color, an off-white, which is unobtrusive. The mini is just a few inches across INSTALLATION: Take the unit out of the box, download the Google Home app, plug in the power, and follow the instructions in the app. OPERATION: The app is the main control point for the device and offers several customization features. Google home devices are advertised as a voice recognition devices and all devices (Home, Mini, Max, Hub) provide the same Smart Home features, although Home Hub has a display. We found the Mini great at voice recognition. You can train the Mini to recognize your voice. Even with conversations in a room it can distinguish a voice it is trained to. When you associate different personal accounts, mail, calendar, and media streaming the Mini creates a personalized response. If I ask for my schedule it give me my calendar information. My wife receives her calendar schedule. The mini will respond to other voices (it responded to a television add!!!) but will not give personalized information. There is a learning curve associated with how to ask for a response. There is a lot of information on the internet, but no definitive source. (See CONS below.) PROS: Fairly easy to set up and use. Provides smart home control. ""Broadcast"" function acts like a home intercom! CONS: It is difficult to determine what the Mini can do. There is no easily accessible manual, list of features, or troubleshooting. To me this is a major drawback to a voice response system. Too many times I asked for something and got a response like “I’m sorry, I can’t do that yet.” The main point of contact is the Google support website chat feature. I found the chat to be helpful, but very time consuming. I even asked the chat technician where I could find the answer to a question online and he was unable to find it via publicly accessible means. Ironic I can’t Google an answer for a Google product!

It is pretty affordable compared to the larger versions and other brands like it, however I could see where there could be downfalls to it being the “mini” version. I love the alarms especially the routines you can set up using your phone. One thing I don’t like is that the only way to ad members to your household that I can tell is adding their email. Also with voice matching you can only have one person set up. Other than a few small things I really enjoy it, especially when connected to something like Spotify it’s very fun to use."

The initial set up took some time -- i needed to have my google password on hand, I had to download the Google Home App to a tablet or phone ( I chose using my Apple tablet), and chose to do a voice recognition to the device. While setting up the first item took some time, once i had this set up, adding additional Google items was very simple. Currently, I have not found all of the possible uses for these devices as you would need to sync them with other items to work together. I have a very unique Internet set up that works particularly slow. When i tried to add several of these, I found some issues/it tended to slow down the Internet. I am looking to add a service provider and explore these further. Meanwhile, I do have the mini and light bulb hooked up and I enjoy this. It is very simple to use, with ""ok Google"" or ""hey google"" and I can turn the light on or off in my entryway. I have also had fun having it play music and asking questions. This seems like a fun and useful little device. The mini itself did not seem to have any negative impacts on the Internet speed and works well. It's a fun little product.Less"

The switch over to Google home products started with a speaker we used as an alarm clock and grew from there. We ended up replacing the Dots with Minis primarily because the Google voice interface is so much more natural and offered more functionality. The Google Minis offer reasonable sound for music and radio, but now offer so much more utility, and the list of functions they can perform is growing. I have replaced my speakerphone with a Mini, linked in to my contact list! With voice identification, even more personalized service is possible, including separate calendars, contact lists, play lists and alarms. Additionally, Google has opened up 'Assistant' so that it can be embedded in devices from other manufacturers.

The first example is if say you have 4 or 5 Google items in your home, you can use it as a intercom system, by simply saying to any device or in your phone app ""OK GOOGLE BLAST"" then every item in your system is alerted to receive what ever you say next, such as ""Dinner In 10 Minutes"". Everyone will hear your statement. Google minis have been set up to work with 100s of items made by different people. Other systems can not do this! You can say OK google play, what ever kind of music you want to hear or turn lights off and on, dim lights, and so much more. First thing you need to do if you have not done so already is download the Google Home App on what ever phone your using. From here set up is very easy. It will ask what WiFi you want to use, after picking yours it will set up automatically. No WiFi passwords needed. The more you add to your home you can name the spots for each item. Such as Den, Living Room, Kids Bedroom and so on. This way you can keep track of of all of your items. I have attached a short video to this showing how easy it is to play music or to control a device. Simply put Google has made a system that is affordably and easy to add to.

Now we control our lights and everything else in our smart home by voice. My kids love it! They have a great time asking Google different questions and asking for lights to be dimmed or the color changed, and Google keeps up pretty well, even though it has only learned my voice. My wife’s voice seems to be the winner, and she can get it to do anything. We use it a lot for timers and alarms—“Hey Google, set a timer for 3 minutes” when someone has earned a time out. “Hey Google, set an alarm for 12:30” when we need to remember to do something then. My kids have asked it to count to one million—Google his smarter than to do the entire thing, but I’ll let you discover its solution on your own. We frequently ask Google to put on music for a dance party. Our idea of a dance party for a bunch of preschool kids is not everyone’s idea for a dance party, and Google sometimes nails it with fun pop music, and sometimes some EDM, and other times it’s totally off for our age range, but it’s always fun none the less. Is the sound great? No, it’s the size of a hockey puck. Is it fine for what we need? Yes, absolutely. And if we need better sound, we just switch over to our home stereo system. Interestingly, Google gets more time than our high end system due to ease of use.

This worked for any Home speaker anywhere in the house and even appeared to work when away from home by using the app, although I wasn't able to verify this. Impressions and recommendations: I did find the light output for the lamp at 760 lumens to be too little to adequately light an average bedroom, but the control was flawless. The only times that I had an issue turning the light on were when I found that my wife had turned the switch off. She's still trying to get the hang of home automation!

4.0,a year ago,ebay.com,"Not perfect, but getting there!","This isn't the full list, but gives you some idea of my main likes/dislikes. Pros: -Very nice little speaker for the price, smart or not. -Google Assistant is very entertaining, better imo than Alexa and the like. -Stylish, fits in pretty much anywhere. -Future support should be excellent as Google are inherently run by software developers. This was a big factor in my decision to buy over Alexa, where Amazon has presumably outsourced the programming to a third party company -Versus Alexa, Google can answer many more questions (I have an echo dot). Alexa struggles to answer even basic questions for me at this time. -Integration into the Android ecosystem is flawless and clean, provided you have relatively modern Android devices. -""Hey Google, play I'm Feeling Lucky"".... Cons: -Lack of Aux output. -Bluetooth connectivity as of 8/8/18 for me is choppy and intermittent when connecting to bluetooth speakers, although Google have said they are aware of this issue and are going to address it in an upcoming update. Fingers crossed. -No built in battery (but that's pretty standard for a smart home device). -Must be connected to wifi to be used. Again, should have offline capabilities implemented soon. -""Continued Conversation"" currently not working for me. This is where the mic is kepton for something like 8 seconds or so to give you a chance to ask follow-up questions to the assistant, rather than saying ""Hey/OK Google"" all the time. Again, Google aware and should update soon. -Top touch button has had to be disabled due to a fault in the mics staying on. Once again, wait for a future update. (You can find lots about this online). Overall, the device is good. Not incredible, but equally not appalling, and in my opinion it blows Alexa out of the water in terms of the voice, the search results, the (current and future) support, and integration with Android. Maybe hold off buying it until a few of those bugs are fixed, but if you can live with them and you can nab this speaker while it's on offer (I got it for 27), then it's definitely not a bad investment.Less"

If I were doing it over again, I would 100% download the app first so I don't have to hear that thing incessantly telling me it isn't set up yet! Setup is easy enough through the app, until you get to connecting to the wifi. Despite the device connecting to the wifi successfully, it, unfortunately, could not communicate with my phone or the app, and instructed me to alter the settings on my wireless connection and router. Where I live, I do not have access to alter the setting on my wifi and/or router, and would have to get my cable and internet provider involved if I wanted to continue in setting up the Google Home in any way.

You can be sitting down or going to bed and say, ""Hey, Google, turn off/on/dim the movie lights"" without walking across the room. I would not rate this as a necessity but it's a very cool novelty and works great. You can also turn on/off and dim the light (0-100%) with your Google Home app. That's pretty neat and requires no voice commands. Pros: Very easy to use and it adds dimming capabilities without an expensive dimmer switch. Con: The only ""con"" I have is when you ask to turn off the light, it always says, ""You got it. Turning off the lights."" If you have little ones sleeping in your home, this can be more of a response than you might like. If your phone is on you, you are able to use the Google Home app. Mini Chalk: This is the standard mini version of the Google Home device.

If you are a really committed Google app user already it may be an awesome platform for you, but I am not a die hard Google person and I got my echo dots first. I think it depends a lot on what you are going to use it for. My best advice is get one of each to try, keep your receipt and return the AI you don't get along with as well, I ended up keeping both AI, but kinda wish I hadn't. One big difference is that unlike the Alexa dot, the Mini lacks any output jack to cable it to external speakers or a stereo. Ugh!!! Any of those connections have to be wireless which cuts out use with any if my older existing audio stuff. I guess they assume you are going to use BT external speakers. Not an issue if you have them already, I guess, but Alexa can use them too so not an advantage over the other. The Google AI just doesn't seem to be quite as smooth or accurate along with something I just can't quite put my finger on.

One of the reasons I got the Mini was to be able to play music hands free. Apparently the issue is with the Google Assistant itself, not the Mini so perhaps giving the Mini a bad review is not accurate. I've noticed others online complaining of the same thing and apparently Google is ""working on"" finding a fix. If you make a playlist on Google Play you can play it manually but NOT hands free. Apparently some people work around this by tapping the microphone symbol then saying what they want to play, but this makes it NOT hands free.

They are also just as easy to use as single room music if the rest of the family doesn't want to hear it. Much cheaper and easier to install and use than a whole house music system. They sound good, but obviously aren't large enough to provide extraordinary base. Besides the whole house music, the smart speakers' features are fun and occasionally convenient. I purchased a Bond and now have voice control over 6 of my ceiling fans/light fixtures after installing remote transmitters in each. I added a Nest Thermostat E and have remote and voice control over that as well. I already had a Chromecast on both TV's in the house and now have voice control over much of that content (pause, play, rewind so many seconds/minutes, stop, etc..).Less"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Does what its meant to at the right price point!,"Bought 2 during the special, which came with 2 sets of c by GE bulbs, all for $60! Could not miss this as I like the idea of using bulbs that work with Google assistant and do not require a separate hub. Personally I think the idea of having a separate hub is ridiculous, but due to the lack of standardization in the industry. It lacks the innovation that led to Harmony remote replacing sex other remotes in my home! And contrary to what the BB tech told me when he said Philips Hue is better (most likely true) and unlike Philips hue which all communicate with the Philips Hub whereas c by GE bulbs all communicate over wifi and drain your bandwidth...this is not true. They use Bluetooth and if they are within 30 ft of each other, they form a comms mesh and relay between each other - genius! Now, the google mini is not much of a speaker, but then I don't need them as speakers - I need them to get me information, carry out my instructions and play night sounds or babbling brook sounds when I go to bed, and wake me up with a gentle alarm - perfect! And over time, I believe they will get more intelligent as SW gets enhanced and updated by GoogleLess"

One of the best tools I've come acrossed, hands down. We can stay up to date on current events, ask for definitions to unfamiliar words as we read in class, solve math problems, ask for riddles and other puzzle games we can work on together! The possibilities are endless! We even use Google as a reward system by asking it to tell us jokes at the end of a lesson! The Mini is an awesome tool for structuring independent and group activities needing an audible timer; just say, ""Hey Google, set a timer for 8 minutes."" Another nice feature Google has is it's voice recognition software. Students are not able to access any information linked with my school google account because it only responds to my voice. I have an Alexa at home, and the two don't even compare. Google products are way more personable and user friendly than my experience with Alexa. Plus, you have the power of Google -not at your fingertips- but by speaking. My Alexa is currently collecting dust. The Google mini is a game changer.Less"

Sure, all we have is a 60w light bulb and a funny little disk, but we can turn the light on to whatever percent conveniently. The surprise part is being able to ask dumb questions like when you're wondering if some movie star is dead or alive. I know, who cares, but it's fun having someone in the room that knows everything (besides me). Also, it plays whatever music that I have in my phone thru it's speaker, which is better than the phone. Of course, there is the privacy issue. We're very boring, so no issue."

These devices really make tasks easier, provided you have the right gear to utilize them. This package is precisely what you need for a taste of the smart home life. Installing the Google Home Mini and GE Smart Light was a breeze. All you do is download the Google Home app on your phone, plug in the Home Mini where you want it, and then follow some quick steps on the app and everything will be set up. Pairing the light and Mini is easy, and a streamlined process through the app itself. The light simply plugs into anywhere a bulb is required, and then the instructions are followed via app to make it work. Overall, both the bulb and Mini seem very well made, and once you invest into smart home technology you'll wonder why you didn't do so sooner.

5.0,a year ago,lowes.com,Google Mini is great but these light bulbs rock!,I put this Google Mini in my guest bedroom so my guests can have access to using Google when they visit. The GE light bulb is awesome because you can put it anywhere you like. My challenge was that I only had one bedside lamp I could put it in based on the lighting already in my home. But it's so awesome that my guests can lay in bed and tell Google to turn off the lamp. I want these in every room in my house so my future lamp purchases will take this into consideration. I've always been a fan of smart homes and Google Home products make it so easy. The Google Mini has a pretty good speaker - of course the larger ones are higher quality but for a guest bedroom it's nice to have one in there. One of the features I love is broadcasting music on all speakers in the entire house. I may buy another mini for outside if it will stand up on my patio outdoors. These products can do so many cool things I love them. I have one in every room in my home and I wouldn't change a thing. Google made them easy to use - you can add as many as you like and trust me the more you have the better. They are fun and super helpful!Less

It easily recognizes our voices and is fun to use in our busy morning routines with news and weather information. The only con I have is it apparently needs to be plugged in at all times. The device itself looks nice but not with the charging wire attached to it. Not to mention the use of outlet space when we all want to charge our phones on the same counter. But besides that, I highly recommend it! Oh and I love the fact I can adjust the temperature on my Nest with it as well."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great if you are invested in Google Assistant,"If you are planning to get these light bulbs to add to your Alexa or Homekit smart homes, these are not for you. If you have invested in Google Assistant, these are pretty good value when they are on sale. They don't require a hub (if you're using Google Home) and they don't use Wi-Fi. Instead, these pair up with your Google Home Minis. I say Minis because it's not just paired with the Google Home Mini that comes in the box, these smart bulbs will operate so long as you have at least one Google Home Mini operating. In a sense the Minis act as a mesh hub. If you are thinking about using the C by GE app for these bulbs, don't. It's terrible and you're much better off just pairing these bulbs through the Google Home app. If you want to schedule these bulbs, you can do so through ""routines"". Overall, if you can get these on sale, it's a no brainer. They're very easy to set up with Google Home. You could use them with Alexa if you buy the C Hub, but I would advise against this. The hub doesn't maintain connection with the bulbs very well.Less"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Cool and Freaky at the Same Time,"This came for free with a Google Nest I bought. My wife and I honestly thought about selling it, but I set it up to see what it's all about. 1st, it was really easy to setup and it automatically recognized my Sony TV and Soundbar. All I had to do was click on the ""Link"" button. You have to login to your Nest account and allow Google Home to access it to change the temperature. You do the same thing with Spotify and I set that as my default music service. It is really cool how well it works when we get home and I can say play Little Big Town on the Living Room speaker and it just works. It's freaky how well it works and in my opinion works 10x better than Siri. I tried to link it to my Bose Bluetooth speaker and that is honestly finicky and only works 2 out of 10 times. I just gave up on it because the Bose would turn off after a period of inactivity and then I couldn't get it to re-link with it the next morning. I think a 3.5mm audio out of the Google Home mini would go a long way. Also, I noticed when you create shortcuts under Routines, that it doesn't always work. I linked the Google Home to my Harmony remote and set up the command ""turn on the tv"" to do the ""ok google, ask harmony to turn on apple tv"" command and it only works 2 out of 10 times. That would be cool if they ironed that out. Otherwise, amazed with how well it works and feel like I'm living in the future.Less"

I like that you can make calls the mobile phones within UK too (including to contacts who don't have the Google Home device, unlike Amazon Echo) Cons: The speaker is not so good if you like listening to music a lot. Virtual volume buttons can be quite annoying sometimes. Any slight contact with your device can switch the volume high or low. The accompanying app is pretty useless, I prefer the Alexa app better"

It was $1 cheaper compared to other stores I've been to which was a steal. Not only is it portable, lightweight and small, it functions well like it is suppose to. The set up process was simple and straight forward. It took a while getting use to. Some things I do not like is how sensitive the charging cable is? Every time I would move around the Google Home Mini, it seems to automatically turn off. I guess the cable is sensitive to movement? Either way, I have the GHM placed in one spot in my bedroom, so it's not like this will become a problem all the time. Also, you CANNOT request a specific song or artist without being a premium member on Youtube, Spotify, Pandora or Google Play Music. I find that to be pretty inconvenient. But it does not limit songs though. Most likely GH will play a random song from an artist you request. It's not totally bad. Besides the cons, Google Home Mini is helpful to me. I can have it set alarm clocks, tell me stories, play rain sounds to help me sleep, etc!Less"

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Always on Sale,"For anyone looking to get a smart home speaker, I would highly recommend the Google Home mini to start. Normally retailing for $49.99, it's usually on sale or part of some promotion going on, so the buy in is very affordable. The real fun comes in when you have multiple Google Homr devices (Google Home Mini, Google Home, Google Home Max, etc.) and multiple Google Home compatible devices to use them with (Phillips Hue lights, Google Chromecast, etc.). You can play the same music in sync around the entire house, relay messages from one Google Home to another, set alarms, control your lights, and much more and you don't have to buy a smart speaker more expensive than the Google Home Mini. It's very user friendly so even if you aren't tech savvy setup is quick and easy. Even if you're only getting one of these and have no other Google Home compatible devices this is great for music, although the sound quality on the mini isn't the best. Anyway, I highly recommend that if you don't already own a smart speaker in your home and if you're curious about getting one, start with this. But if you can be patient, don't buy it at $49.99. Wait for a promotion or sale if you can because there's usually one on Best Buy.Less"

I love how I can have the Google Assistant installed on my Android phone and Apple iPad, set a reminder on my Google home, and then remind me on all my other devices. The integration is really good, not to mention the direct tie in to Google Calendar (the most capable calendar I've used). As far as the hardware, the speaker on the Home Mini is leaps and bounds better than the one on the Echo Dot in sound quality, volume and dispersion (Seriously, it sounds really good).

5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Never knew I needed one until I had one,"I was skeptical at first with all of the smart assistants until I got use to using the Google Home Mini. My apprehension stemmed from not wanting all of my personal data floating around for someone to grab until I realized that I use a Pixel phone so they have it anyway. Once I got over this hurdle I have really enjoyed using this product. I mostly use it for controlling my smart home, lights etc. I do ask questions of it sometimes but mostly used to extend my command range for lights and stuff. I would recommend picking one or two up and giving them a try I feel that you will be pleasantly surprised."
4.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Great little home automation device,"I never thought I would use one of these home automation speakers, but I received one free with another BB purchase. Boy am I glad for that little freebie. My family and I use this thing all the time, from starting different TVs, running the roomba, adjusting the temperature of our Nest or just listening to music and playing games, we use the home mini constantly. We have ended up using the Google Home so much that we actually bought a couple more for different areas of the home. As long as you're cool with the idea of Google listening to everything you say (which already happens if you have a smartphone) you'll love this little device."
3.0,6 months ago,staples.com,I kind of like it,"There are aspects that I like. It tells jokes, and you can ask any question because of Google search engine. But when I finally figured out how to connect it to devices like my Roku TV, it was underwhelming really. I can't ask it to go to a certain streaming station, or to change channel or anything like that. Also when it comes to the music, it cannot access my Amazon Prime account, and the music that would play without ads. Instead I get marketed to and almost cajoled into subscribing to YouTube music. I can ask it to go to Prime music, But there again I don't seem to be able to say which playlist. Seems okay to turn things on, but not so good for controlling them."

If you ask for specific songs or genre, she will tell you that's only available on Premium You Tube membership - but here's something similar you may like - Love it! Quickly intuitive of what you are asking and superb voice recognition. Great Alarm - which Google set up by itself when I said Goodnight to her. You don't need to say ""OK Google"" just Hey Google music volume by to 4 ... and she does exactly what you tell her! It's like having a friend who doesn't back chat ;-)"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,The friend I never knew I wanted,"I was skeptical about bringing in a smart assistant into the house, but when a set of Phillips Hue lights came bundled with a free Google Home Mini, I was compelled to give it a try. The charcoal Home Mini represents my second one. I enjoyed the first one so much, I needed to expand the range into the bedroom so I could yell out ""Ok Google, turn off all the lights"" from the comfort of my bed. I find myself asking Google to do all sorts of things, from setting alarms and timers, telling me how long it will take to drive somewhere, or telling me how long to cook a baked potato in an Instant Pot. I've even directed her to play music, but this isn't the best sounding speaker out there (it's good for prioritizing laziness over sonic quality). If you're steeped in the Google ecosystem, she can even make calls and send messages on your behalf (I'm in the Apple world so I haven't tried this). Overall, this little gadget balances convenience and price and becomes so addictive, you'll want to sprinkle multiple Mini's all over your house.Less"

My phone doesn’t need to be unlocked to play pandora which is awesome. She also tells me the weather, how long my public transit commute will take, I can ask her to remind me in 15minutes to take a pill, pretty much anything I can think of. The sound quality is not bad at all for what it is. Not a lot of bass but the volume is high. She does not hear me too well over loud music though. Overall, great accessory!"

This additional Home Mini was very easy to set up and it works very well. It will answer my questions, turn on/off lights, play music, tell me jokes, keep me updated on the news, weather, etc. It's a great little device and I highly recommend it to others."
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,A solid smart assistant for Google service users,"I've owned several Amazon Echo devices and a Google Home and can say they're both useful additions to the home - having access to information and utilities like setting timers is incredibly useful in everyday life, in the kitchen, etc. I like the Home mini's aesthetics more than the Echo Dot - the fabric cover looks and feels nice, and the four LEDs to display status are nice and subdued. The speaker on the device is decent, but not great. You'll want one of the full-size versions (Google Home or Amazon Echo gen. 2) if you'd like to listen to any music on the speaker with any real fidelity. However, for listening to voice responses, podcasts, or audiobooks, the Home Mini's speaker works just fine. The size is convenient and lets you install it just about anywhere in the home. You can even get some command strips and hang it on a wall easily. That said, it's pretty stylish and you'll probably want to display it somewhere openly to add to a room. The Home Mini is backed by Google's AI technology, so it's superior to the Echo (and, likely, the upcoming Apple HomePod speaker using Siri) for answering questions and queries, but currently, the Echo has a wider range of third-party services it supports through its ""Skills"" system. Google will probably catch up eventually, but for now, its main use is answering simple questions, starting timers and setting reminders, and helping you with connected google services like Google Calendar. You can also use the speaker as a Google Cast device to cast audio to its speaker, and even connect it with other Google Cast-compatible speakers to set up a multi-room audio solution. Again, the speaker isn't great, but it'll get the job done. Overall this is a nice showing from Google, and it's good to see these smart assistant devices starting to become more affordable than ever.Less"
4.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Nice product but limited utility for me,"I like the design of this product and the voice user interface. After playing with it for a while though, I don't think it has such great utility unless you are real home automation type. I don't have colored WiFi light bulbs or a WiFi controlled door lock or ... So for me, it doesn't really do anything I could do with my Android phone. I probably should get a smart thermostat and more toward voice control of my household alarm system but haven't been up for the new infrastructure costs. The small amount for the Home Mini is very minor compared to the devices."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great even as a mini.,"I have been looking at this mini smart speaker for quite a long time for use in my bedroom. The weekend of Father's day I bought it and tried it out and really liked it, playing music it sounded very nice at half volume and late at night using very low volume it sounded very thin like an AM radio on a station that is just on the edge of being received, kind of squeaky and irritating. But while I had been looking up the Google speakers here on Best Buy I saw their bundling offers so the next day I went back to the store and tried out some of the competitors that still used Google Assistant that were in stock on display and ended up buying the Google Home and this Google Mini. It has worked very nicely, I use the mini in my home gym where I can use it at half volume and the Google Home sounds great at any volume for placement wherever you'd like as long as the room isn't too large and you can connect them together to use somewhat like an intercom and a lot of other useful things, a seemingly endless list and often growing list. It listens very well, I haven't had to repeat myself or had a request misunderstood yet. I'm glad I finally bought these. I previously used Window's smart system and either I wasn't smart enough or it didn't do what I needed it to do.Less"
2.0,a month ago,Currys,Mark's review of Google Home Mini,"Pros: It's small and unobtrusive, picks up voice well from a distance. Cons: Disappointed it doesn't really do much. Sure, it can play music (although getting the track you want can be hit and miss), it tells you the time (but so does the watch I have on my wrist), it tells me the weather (but so does an app on my phone and thats about it ... so its actually a bit of a let-down. Annoyingly though, my children are constantly asking it to play their favourite pop song and raise the volume whilst I watch TV. There's no way to teach it to only respond to my voice and so it is constantly getting unplugged. I wouldn't bother buying it if I had the chance again :("

With plans to purchase more later specifically for the multi room music function. I was aware the mini speakers weren't the greatest quality when playing music. I wasn't concerned because I was going to connect each mini to a different Bluetooth speaker. Bluetooth playback was awful for both minis contecting to any Bluetooth speaker. Choppy and stuttered playback on almost every song. I reset the minis, removed and reconnected every Bluetooth speaker with no improvement. I tried more than 1 music source, not just Spotify. I connected other Android and apple devices to my existing Bluetooth speakers without issues. A quick Google search will tell you this is a large and common problem. I would not have chosen this product knowing that.Less"

It was easy and took about 5 minutes to setup. Included in the package is a Google home mini and GE C-life Smart Bulb. I initially setup the bulb with the Google Mini in the bedroom but because I have several google mini in other rooms I can control the light from several different rooms. I have not purchased any additional light bulbs so I cannot comment on how well it works with multiple lights. On the plus side you can have an economical speaker and personal assistant in the bedroom. You can get the weather, set an alarm, check the traffic while laying in the bed before work. All in all, this is a solid entry-level device kit that works pretty well. I would recommend it to a friend or relative.Less"

This kit is a good tool to use to dip your toe into the smart future - you know the pieces are designed to work together. The Home Mini provides voice control and the light gives you useful proof that the technology works. Installation is easy and quick - but you do have to have either an Android or iOS device (phone or tablet) connected to your wifi network. Download the Google Home software, execute it, answer a few questions and you're running. Total time for me, well under 10 minutes (read the screens carefully or you might have a few points of frustration - but you can always just kill the app and start over). And there's a bonus! the Home Mini is also a speaker to which you can (verbally) route audio content (e.g. music) that even sound pretty good. Certainly enough for low volume use.Less"

You will also be able to set up lighting routines/schedules and remotely control the lights directly from the Google Home app from wherever you are located.

With all the features they provide it's nice to be able to walk into the room and say ""Hey Google"" and have it do pretty much what ever I need. My kids and guests enjoy it very much too. The music quality on these small units is similar to my old clock/radio unit. It sounds good for the room size but lacks the BASS/TREBLE control the Max or Home offer. If you are big on playing music louder then I suggest getting the Google Home or MAX units. Being able to tell it to turn on or off a light is very convenient and saves on electricity. I can even control them while away from home in case I forgot or want to make my home look occupied at night.

Even then it will play some random song from Spotify on my Chromecast when I simply tell it to set a 60 second timer.. Absolutely one of the most primitive overpriced products on the market. The app tells me it cannot learn my voice please try again later for over 6 weeks now and it almost feels like the microphone performance has been slowly degrading (only owned for 2 months now lol). Would love if I could actually return this scam but i'm two months into ""ownership""... Just thought I'd give it one more go this week before I tossed it.

This is primarily because the audio quality has much better than the Dot. I have mine in my kitchen and while it doesn't sound amazing by any means it's good enough that I've been using it a lot for music and podcasts while cooking or doing dishes. It also can get surprisingly loud. As far as Google assistant, I've found it to be more reliable when asking for random information than Alexa. Search is Google's speciality and it shows. It does have a couple downsides. It doesn't seem like the microphones are quite as good as the Dot. When saying ""hey Alexa"" from various distances away, the Dot seemed to pick that up more reliably. Sometimes it will take a couple tries with the Google even when just a few feet away. I do wish it would have a line in port like the Dot does too. The Dot definitely still has the upper hand as far as connecting to other devices.

It’s kind of what you would expect from a $30-$40 bluetooth speaker that you can buy at almost any store nowadays.

If you’re looking for an incredible speaker, you probably aren’t shopping at this price range anyway, but just temper your expectations. That being said, as a compact, affordable smart speaker, it is outstanding. It takes up almost no space, picks up voice commands from clear across the room, and plays well with other Google devices.

I called support and they walked me through and all I had to do was reboot my router and that solved the problem. You can use this to listen to music, set an alarm, turn on your lights if you have smart bulbs. You can also download your contact list from your cell phone and make a phone call through the speaker. They are not very expensive so you can add more speaker in other rooms."

If you have ever snuggled into bed only to realize you left the light on and had to get out of bed to flip the switch you will appreciate this device! It is learning my voice and is now my morning alarm. I initially resisted setting up electronic devices in my home but once I relented and tried them I am hooked. The convenience and ability to control (turn on & off) from anywhere is definitely convenient and saving me money (on my electric bill).
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Please Understand What I'm Saying!,"I bought this item to experience Google Assistant as a dedicated device for my home. Sound quality is substantial and Google's responses are fairly adequate. It controls my lights and chromecast connected to my TV. Anytime I want to watch something on Netflix, Youtube or Youtube TV, I'll tell Google to set it up for me. I even set up timers for cooking, which has been surprisingly helpful. I even inform Google Home Mini to wake me up for naps in which it has been handy as well. The only thing that irks me is the learning curve of what other things that I can tell Google Assistant to do. If I try something new to say, I usually get ""I'm sorry, I don't know how to do that yet."" I had to go online to find what other commands or feedback Google Assistant can respond to. By the way, if the sound volume is way too high and it's playing music, you would need talk louder or probably scream at Google to hear you for the next request / command. Other than that, it works fairly well.Less"

The longest part was of course the update process but with this device it took just under 5 minutes to update. Once updated, and in the room I wanted, it was time to try out the sound. The nice part is that I can connect this speaker with all the other Google Home, Home Max Chalk that I have in our home so I can listen to the same music throughout the house no matter what room I'm in it even when I'm out in the shop. The sound and quality of this speaker is absolutely amazing. It sounds like your right there in front of the band live in concert, with a Chrystal clear voicals. The bass oh my goodness is just as amazing when I have this and my other 4 speakers going the vocals and bass thump throughout the house. This too is on my list of must have more of too...

As small as it is, people will not notice it until you ask it something. It has the same voice as the Home and can do just about anything that the Home can do. I use the mini as an extension to the Home. You can ""broadcast"" a message to all units identified as your home group (Set-up is made with your phone on the free Google Assistant App). Then if you ask your Google Home to broadcast your message, it will be heard on all units except the one that is broadcasting. Though it can be used as an extension of Google Home, it can be a stand-alone unit and do whatever you do with the larger Google Home. The sound is excellent for such a small device and it sits and waits for you to tell it to do something, or answer a question. The Google Mini can go almost anywhere in a room and will not attract attention until it answers your command.Less"

Great as a digital radio and being able to broadcast to other Mini's in the house - saves a lot of yelling. We're gradually finding more uses every day. Our 5yo is a big fan and asks it for stories and to play songs or jokes. Cons: The cord could be longer. The AI often doesn't have instinctive understanding you expect from something that talks and needs things to be reworded. Some simple tasks are overly complex and some complex tasks are easy

The individual speech recognition needs improvement. When I first recorded my voice, it worked for a while. The next morning when I was tired and my voice was rough, it didn't recognize my voice. I re-recorded my voice and it worked a while but later that night it didn't recognize me again. This is annoying because you can't set or listen to reminders unless your voice is recognized. For the price, it's still worth the money. It was very easy to setup and works really well for general inquiries such as the weather, what year a movie came out or how many milliliters in a cup while cooking. Responses are not only accurate but immediate which is very impressive. I ordered this to test it out before giving one to my in-laws. I wanted to be sure it would work wll and be easy enough to use.

I love being able to instantly ask it a question when something comes to mind faster and easier than it would take me to use my phone. Plus it's great for quickly adding things to my shopping list, my calendar, and it can tell us apart so it knows who's shopping list or schedule to put what on.

5.0,2 years ago,John Lewis,Fun gadget,"We have had this google mini installed in our kitchen. Firstly to set the google mini you need to download the google home app and follow the setup instructions, this is common of many electrical products. The set up did seem to take a long time but this could of been down to my internet connectivity rather than the app itself. The google mini needs to be plugged in at all times, It would of been nice if the cable colour matched the device to blend it in more as the white cable stands out on our black worktops and the actual plug is bulky but this is personal preference and doesn't affect the product. We have been very impressed with the google minis 'understanding' it never fails to answer or perform the task requested regardless of who has asked it, woman, man, or child. As a speaker I don't think the sound quality is as good as other speakers on the market but that said other speakers don't remind you to make a packed lunch or tell you how long to cook roast parsnips for. We haven't got Spotify or googleplay which are the main music platforms supported by the voice activation but it is simple to pair your phone or table via Bluetooth to play music. You can request it plays radio stations for you without the need for a secondary device nearby if you don't use the above mentioned platforms. There is so much this device can do and we haven't even begun to fully utilise it yet, what we have done is; -Stored shopping lists on it so when you've got dirty hands cooking and use the last of something you can add it to the shopping list straight away without forgetting - Kitchen timer, you can ask it how long is left on the timer too - New and weather updates specific to you're local area or wherever else you request - Recipes - Radio - TImer My 9 year old has particularly enjoyed some of the fun features like beat boxing, trivia games and getting the answer to his maths homework.

2.0,a year ago,bestbuy.ca,Very useful more than I thought it would be.,The Google mini and it's bigger brother the Google home are surprisingly useful. I originally purchased them as I was curious about their usefulness for those with physical disabilities but who could speak clearly. My personal disability Is cerebal palsy. . Currently I have five smart lights and a smart TV under their control. I soon plan to have at least one set of smart blinds connected to them as well. I know the technology is still evolving. It is quite liberating to be able to do simple everyday tasks with just your voice. It is good enough that the entire group home I am living in is considering implementing Google home in a few of their other Apartments. Additionally Google home and the Google mini are a lot of fun! All of the smart devices are in a continuous state of evolving and being updated. This technology is very promising. Highly recommend the Google mini.

Product was unremarkable at first, appearing as a standard portable speaker. The mini feels durable and well made. Compact in dimension, despite the size it produced good sound. Quick and easy set up. Ready to go in mere minutes. Fun to ask obscure question. Picks up voice commands easily even when speech is muffled or distorted. Although I am not familiar with the extent of to which this device is capable of performing. The commands thus far are entertaining and hopeful as the device claims it was capable of learning. Requires a Wi-Fi connection. Must be connected and plugged into the power supply at all times in order to work. Although the Mini has a mute mic switch, it is not clear if it is actually off or just not taking command (useful if you sleep talk to note this switch). Ultimately, I am pleasantly surprised by this product. I am looking forward to learning more about it.Less"
3.0,a year ago,lowes.com,Lite control,"Google Mini & light bulb: I love this in theory. Being able to control the lights with my voice feels very techy and futuristic, but in reality, it doesn’t actually add a whole lot of convenience to my life. Perhaps if you have a light that is somewhat out of reach or you have mobility issues, this could be of value. It would be great if Google updated their alarm settings to include lights too. If I could set my alarm to turn on my light in the morning with my alarm, then I could see it being really neat, but right now, that is not an option. The other strange quirk of it is that every time you tell it to turn the light on or off, it responds, “OK. Turning off the light” which, depending on what volume your speaker is on can be a loud surprise! I’ve stopped turning the light off at night this way because I’m afraid of waking someone up. I can’t seem to find a way to turn this off. All in all, I can see this being a very affordable addition to a smart home, but it’s only really necessary in specific situations. 3/5Less"
5.0,a year ago,lowes.com,Good but ......,"In many ways the Google Home Mini is a great product; however, there is room for improvements. First off, the instruction accompanying the product can use a little more details, or the purchaser should hire someone to get the work done. The process is by no means complicated but for someone who is not familiar with computer and wifi system, it can be frustrating and time consuming. Google seems to expect people to utilize its search engine to get themselves familiar with the product before setting it up. After getting the Mini working, it is indeed a great 'toy' to play with. A 'Toy' because it is just like a getting a new toy and so much to explore to see what it can. When linked with other smart home products, you can control them without lifting a finger. It can also answer most of the questions that you can throw at it. It does produce fairly respectable sound for its size. Best of all, you can control its on/off and volume simply by talking to it.Less"

Being a seasoned elder the directions of just down load the app and set it up. It's very confusing to set it up. I gave up after a couple of weeks trying on and off.

Generally the nearest one responds. Making calls to family phones is a great feature and it works smoothly. Cons: So far it's not possible to use them as room-to-room intercoms like Alexa, but software updates are frequent and full of new stuff, so I'm sure it will come. You can however broadcast to all units, even from your phone when you're out, and the recipient can reply, which is cool."

In my place it sounds ok, but anything at max volume with any kind of bass, will distort. But general sound is good, and I typically run it at about 75% volume.

My only complaint is that it can be difficult to factory reset the smart light bulb if the light fixture is not working on a switch. I changed my WiFi router and found it easiest to just factory reset my google home devices and reinstall them. All of my home devices have a button so doing a factory reset is easy. With the bulb you have to turn the light on and off a bunch of times for 10 seconds then 5 seconds about 10 times. I could not do this via the lamp switch.

I can even ask it to play a certain genre without selecting it on my phone and it does it. It tells me my local weather when I’m deciding what to wear in the morning and answers a lot of questions much better than Siri does. Never had an issue and we also use it with our Nest Thermostat.

If have guest and they don’t have the app to control lights. Don’t worry. They just have to flip switch off and on and it will turn lights on. At least to there last brightness setting. Really handy for those who hop in bed with lights on and decide you want a nap or sleep for the night and would have to get out of bed to turn lights off. With this you can either use app on phone or just say ok google, turn off all lights or bedroom light etc. or in our case, wife likes to first dim our bedroom light to 5 or so percent.

I thought I set it up wrong but after some research I discovered that the Google Home Mini will not control your door locks by design. This is because someone could shout in an open window ""OK Google unlock doors"" and then they can gain access. Or a crook can break a window and shout the same thing. This makes sense. There are work arounds whereby you can get it to work with door locks but if you do this I recommend that you only enable the door lock command and not the door unlock command for the previous stated reasons.

Well I connected my Google home mini and Bam. My Google Assistant doesn't seem to have any problems connecting or controlling my lights. Now, I still use Alexa to turn on or off single lights, because my Google Assistant just wants to tell me where I can get lights... But I figure that's part of the learning curve lol. With that being said, I am a tad disappointed in the level of skills, extensions, whatever you want to call it... Here's another example. I use an Alexa skill called sugarmate to ask for my current blood sugar (I wear a Dexcom monitor). I can say ""hey Alexa, ask sugarmate where I'm at"" and she will say something like ""you're 182 and steady, last checked two minutes ago."" As you can guess that's real handy.

5.0,a month ago,Currys,A.'s review of Google Home Mini,"Pros: It is worth money if you want a cheap speaker or alarm, check weather etc. Simple design. Cons: I couldn't install Google Home app on my phone bought in December 2015 or my a few years old iPad. Google talks about environment but then Google's developers push me to buy a new phone even if the old one is working perfectly. Not environmentally friendly because of that. Also, Google suggests buying Youtube Premium when you want to play a song what is annoying. Still needs many improvements."
4.0,a year ago,lowes.com,Part of a complete Google Home system or use alone,"If you're into going wireless throughout your home, the Google Home system works well. The voice response on the Home Mini is quite good and the sound quality not bad for such a small unit. I now have this unit connected to my Home WiFi router along with a Home Max, a regular Home unit and two other minis. The whole system was relatively easy to set up although when I interrupted one device attachment I found it a bit difficult to get back to complete the install. With the WiFi router I now have two completely separate networks running in my house from one cable modem. Throughput seems very good and there is no interference. One feature that Google should consider adding is the ability to use one Home device to send voice messages to another - or even support VOIP to make a home intercom system.Less"

I will probably get another one or two for the basement and bedroom. My current one lives in the kitchen. I do wish you could give it another wake up word other than hey or ok google. I think it would be a great idea to let you pick your own name, or give a list of possible names if it needs certain syllables to be effectively recognized. It would also be great if it would play an exact song you ask for from youtube with out paying for youtube red. Looking forward to all the cool google things to come. I chose google over Alexa and Cortana due to its ability to control a more affordable group of items and working with existing items that I had.

Lately, it say ""I'm sorry"" or ""To get help with that, go look online"" or some nonsense like that. Even to really simple questions. Alexa is definitely better now, It's kind of like Google voice to text on your phone, used to work great, but now it's barely usable.

This review is mine and has not been influenced by anyone. With that being said I really like the starter kit. I have to admit I don’t think the Mini Chalk is as loud or as crisp as the Max Chalk but I have installed the mini in my bedroom alone with the GE Bulb. The set up was fast and easy even for someone who’s not tech savvy. I have to admit it’s taking us a while to start the commands correctly but that’s just because we’re definitely not use to telling a device to do something. That will improve with time. But it’s absolutely great to have the mini set up in the bedroom to use as an alarm, find out the weather. I love the bulb!! I love being able to turn my light on or off while I’m in bed. We have such a small room that we no longer have to run into a dresser or nightstand to get into the bed. Don’t really know what we did before all this technology!!

My boyfriend liked mine so much i bought him one for his birthday. He's researched everything you can do with it and taught me things such as locating my phone when i put it somewhere and cant find it....worth the price of the device right there! The only reason I'm giving a 4/5 is because I find using lists has been a bit frustrating when you have more than one set up. I hope they work on this in the next software update but the speakers themselves are great!

Suffice it to say that after about 15 minutes setting it up at their home, I had them try it and it understood and replied back in Korean. That's awesome. Why can't mine do that?

But with a deal, I managed to pick one up and see the hype. They're actually pretty, fun! Except when it starts listening randomly as I'm watching TV. Guess I can't blame the poor thing. TV is no fun if you can't hear it! Or see it, for that matter (though this devices claims to *not* have a camera installed). From asking for random facts, to setting reminders, this tool is spiffy to have around. Your smart phones, android OR apple, are already enabled to listen to you when ever some 3rd party with authority wants to, OR as you give them permission to. So why not have a smart speaker around? Here's my gripe, however. This device can control your lights and appliances (as you purchase compatible hardware to do so), yet, out of the box, it CAN NOT send text messages, or messages through apps such as telegram!!! I was pretty bummed when I found this out. It can however, place phone calls. By default, it uses a private, anonymous number. But you can set it up to use your google voice, or actual phone number. So that's pretty cool I guess. My neighbors still haven't guessed who keeps calling them, usually while I'm watching some un-specified horror movie. Gotta love clowns. Anyway, I recommend anyone atleast give this a try. It was well packed, and pretty dang easy to set up. Thanks, google! For the fantastic offer. It's almost like they're trying to get one of these in every home, or something! haha Google > Alexa, when it comes to functionality.

Like a clapper (Clap on Clap Off) but smarter! I think the Google Home is really neat- it can tell jokes, tells me summaries of the weather and the news in the morning when i'm getting ready, I can connect both with the app and tell it to Play Pop music on my home stereo and it'll play on all my google home mini's. I love that feature. The more products you have connected to it, the more you are able to control these items. At the Target near my home, there's a display of Google Home products that showcase how the Nest thermostat and lock work with it as well. Very neat, and the functionality only builds when you have more items. If you don't care about that type of feature this product is not for you.Less"

The setup and use of the Google Home ecosystem will take you a few hours to get it perfect, but it's well worth the time put into it. As for the actual customer service and feedback, I was blown away. Yesterday (6/27/2018) there was a worldwide outage for some of the Google Home platform. I assumed that this was a software bug and it was, so I didn't even contact anyone assuming they would patch it. And they did, within half a day. What really made me feel compelled to write this was that Google contacted me, without any reason to, regarding the outage, and clarified what happened.

5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Many uses for blind person and sighted people too,"We purchased a Google Home Mini for a blind friend. I help her with her tech and can attest to her frustration at trying to use Web sites with a screen reader. (Imagine something reading every link and ad and heading on a Web page when you are trying to get to certain content!) She was wary of getting yet another device at first, and I made sure she knew we were happy to return this product if she didn't like it. But she has really taken to it. The Google Home Mini is the size of a donut and is really a speaker with smart capabilities when set up with your home Wi-Fi network. It has a microphone on/off switch and a USB cord output that connects to a power plug because it needs to be powered from a wall outlet. My friend put her Google Home Mini on her dining room table. It has great sound for such a small device, and can give her the time, weather, and look up local businesses' operating hours and telephone numbers (and make calls over Wi-Fi -- although the call quality isn't that great when I tested it with her). She can have it set a timer or search for a recipe from the Internet, for say, a cake or something and then read her the directions one by one when she is ready. You can say, Hey Google, play KCBS-AM San Francisco or WBBM-AM Chicago or WCBS-AM New York, or many other stations nationwide, and it will do it! It will play podcasts, such as cooking podcasts or Spanish podcasts. We are still finding out all that it can do! Two complaints: 1) You cannot setup the Google Home Mini out of the box using a computer. You need a tablet or smart phone and have to download the Google Home App to that first in order to set up the Google Home Mini. My friend doesn't have a smart phone or tablet. As a work around, I downloaded the Google Home App to my smart phone, added her Google account to my phone, and set up her Google Home Mini and chose her default news outlets and other settings. After a week or two, I deleted the app and her account from my smart phone so that her contacts and information would not be on my phone. But I really wish you could set up Google Home Mini without doing this. 2) As of this writing, Google Home Mini would not simply play audio from a YouTube clip over its speaker. It can send a YouTube clip to a TV that has a Chromecast device attached, but it'd be better if it could also just play the audio portion on the Google Home Mini speaker without having to connect to another device. But overall, I think the Google Home Mini (and the Amazon Echo) have great potential for blind and visually impaired people. Any of the features I mentioned can also be helpful to a sighted person, of course, but for a blind person or a busy parent in a house with children (little time to sit and type on a keyboard), I can really see the Google Home Mini being extra useful.Less"

However, this baby has two woofers and two tweeters and electronics that balance the sound which really makes this thing sound terrific. Great bass notes lovely highs as well,It worth having it just to Bluetooth your device to to stream music or stream your favorite amazon Spotify etc. it, however, won’t use Apple Music as your default player like all the home devices.It says you can pair another max together and use them as separate stereo channels and they can be used in a vertical or horizontal position. Down side it cost $400 almost and a pair would be pretty expensive to stream music to but you do get all the other perks of having google home devices. It weighs about 10 pounds so sit on something sturdy too. Great device , is it worth $400 ? You decideLess"

Honestly I'm kind of mad that the price on the Google store (as of May 9th, 2019) is $35, and I got this for $38.30 including tax, so I really missed out buying this at Walmart. It is what it is though. The setup was very easy, plug in the Mini, download the Home app, and connect the Mini. Then, screw in the light bulb and set it up. There's also a voice match which is nice. Overall, pretty good product, but I hate how I could've gotten it $35 from the Google Store."

The mic is really impressive, able to distinguish your voice in crazy bad conditions (like when I'm across the room, shouting over the soundbar sitting right next to it). The ecosystem has really exploded in the last year, with all sorts of new products and services integrating with Google.

This thing packs a punch for the price and was a cinch to set up. Now I've fully migrated from Alexa/Ring products to Google/Nest because of how intuitive everything is and how well-supported the products are."

Normally I don’t write reviews ,but I been using this so much for news podcasts, nextflix casting, and paired with a cheap WiFi smart bulb from amazon an ambient light with 16million colors. I’ve had “guests” over and set custom up commands to almost instantly change the mood of the room. It’s like you step into “hey arnolds” bedroom.

Seems to only be an issue with reminders. I did send google feedback, but just today. Love google's clever remarks, love the knowledge it has, love how easy it is to work and love the side taps that can change the volume even though there are no physically visible buttons. I have 4 Alexa devices in my home and I still love my google mini. They have different knowledge and it seems google knows more and has several clever comebacks for the same question asked over. Alexa always responds with the same one response answer. I still do love my Alexa's also, though. Oh also in my opinion sound quality is very crisp very good.Less"

I was hoping it would broadcast any media I play on my phone, but it’s somewhat awkward to find an app that it will work with. For example, it doesn’t work with Apple Music (which makes perfect sense) but it works with Apple’s Podcast app. And I have an app for audiobooks, and it doesn’t broadcast that at all. As I transfer to more Google products (including Chromecast) it’ll be very useful. For now it’s great for podcasts, but I can’t actually do much with it other than that."
4.0,3 weeks ago,Currys,Anonymous's review of Google Home Mini,"Pros: Google has really nailed the speech recognition, and the speaker is clear enough and is good enough quality that anything you play through it is well recieved. Cons: The Google home doesn't have that much in the way of things it can do. As complex and interesting as the things it can do are they are relatively limited. It's best used as a speaker you can remotely connect to rather than nessisarily something you tell what you want to. Pulling up netflix shows is very feasible but navigating through them with the google home is a hassle."

Connects well to other Google and Nest products and takes action, for example the Nest Hello doorbell or the Nest Thermostat can all be controlled by this little puck like device. I assume this is a loss leader for Google to collect data. I feel a little better giving my data to Google than I do Amazon - although I would rather Apple were able to compete based on their approach to privacy. Siri is not even close to this Google assistant unfortunately."

The google service was extremely helpful in patient but the device refused to work. Also this error has persisted on this device for around 6 months without fix at this point.

I tell it to turn on the kitchen light and it turns on the bathroom light. I tell the Hub to turn on the kitchen light and it does. My Hub stops controlling some light bulbs for no clear reason. I've spent hours trying various fixes, like factory resetting everything or renaming and moving the devices. And it just continues to happen. I'm not in love with the Android App either. It's impossible to find some things that are buried deep within the menus...like the light bulbs. They need to significantly increase the number of apps/devices that integrate with Home.

If the set did nothing more we would be well pleased, but there is more, much more! Turning lights on and off remotely is another great feature along with adjusting the brightness and we haven’t even mentioned all of the functionality that comes with Google Assistant. We have learned smart bulbs are like anything else, there are more feature rich bulbs on the market (color change, tone, etc) that come with a price to match.

There is a free smart phone app that may be downloaded which enables users of this device to customize it to one's environment. It also have some funny responses to certain commands and inquiries. The only drawback, of course, is that it has an open mic (which may be manually shut off easily) that MAY enable a hacker to listen to conversations / activities that take place near this device.

5.0,a year ago,lowes.com,Works Surprisingly Well,"Bought this initially to obtain the Mini Chalk, but the smart lamps have become a great asset for our primary living room. Being able to dim the lighting with voice commands has been instrumental in making the room more adjustable to different activities. Of course a dimmer would have served this purpose, but if you do not feel comfortable working with wiring (or hiring an electrician) this is a great option. Also, the lamps can be controlled independently or as a group, which a dimmer would not likely be able to do (depending on configuration). The Mini Chalk was my first experiment with this kind of technology, which I believed I didn't need in my home, but it is great and very useful for mundane daily requests like music, weather, and stock prices.

All in all, this is a cool little device that can help you stay organized, entertain you, or help answer simple questions. Definitely recommend."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,So much FUN!!,"I think its important to note that I am a senior citizen. I was given a Home Mini as a gift a year ago, and I love it so much that I bought 2 more to give as Christmas gifts. After giving one to my friend at Christmas - I went to her home and helped her set it up. That in itself became a fun social time. We laughed and laughed so much. There are so many uses for this item that Im sure I have barely scratched the surface of learning what it can do. These make excellent gifts! And a good word to describe them is - FUN!"
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great google assistant devices,"I've bought four of these devices in both black and white cloth cover, they came free with the Nest thermostats. It was an easy setup when you link your google account to it. There is a hardware button to mute the microphone. I've accepted devices listening all the time and pray that google isn't an evil corporation ;-) Besides it's just like carrying around my cell phone around all the time that has a better microphone and is both wifi and cellular. I would recommend using a separate router/switch for your IOT devices so they are on a different network than your main network. You can use your speakers together as a group for casting to multiple speakers, but I don't think with just two speakers it will play in stereo. I believe there is a dev way to set it up that I will try later some time. It does recognize different voices and you can link up to three different google accounts, my wife and I did setup multiple accounts and it does recognize which account to use by our voices after you do voice setup and link it to the specific account. I can also control my Nest devices from any of the four mini devices CONS: you can accidentally press the sensitive side buttons for volume when picking up the device. I don't know if they have a bracket to hang it on the wall or stand it up on stand, I have some on a higher shelf and can't see the lights respond to my voice commands, but you can turn on the settings to play a sound note for either start/end of a voice command response. Wish you can you use amazon prime music like pandora premium, I don't know if this was done on purpose being google? Sometimes when we use the free Pandora music service the music will stop randomly, I believe because Pandora is asking if you are still listening and you have to click online that yes you are still listening. We don't have this issue with the premium spotify services.Less"
5.0,3 months ago,lowes.com,Google Smart Light starter kit,"This thing was a breeze to install. Plug it in, screw in the light bulb and download the FREE Google Home app. Since I already had the Google Home Max Hub, this was a wonderful add on. Placing it in our den makes it soooo easy to walk in and just say, ""Hey Google, turn on the lamp."" With a plate in one hand and a drink in the other for an evening of TV, this wonderful little assistant will prevent years of spills. It truly is the start for being able to control almost everything in our house simply by saying, ""Hey Google""."
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Great companion to Google Home,Added this as a companion to my present Google Home. The mini was place in bedroom on the 2nd whereas Google Home is on the first floor. Both control all my Hue lights. Also I can play independent music on each device at the same time or play the same music on both devices. Or play music on either one. They work independent of each other. It was easy to install. Looking to get a 2nd Google mini for the basement.
5.0,6 months ago,lowes.com,Super easy to use,"The Google Smart Light starter kit seemed like the smart way to ease my way into making my house a smart home. It's super easy to use. I put this in the bedroom to test it out. I can get comfortable in bed and turn the light off without getting up again. You can dim the light too. I even have Google play relaxing sounds while I fall asleep... and when I wake up, I can find out the weather and check my calendar for the day just by asking. I will definitely be adding more smart bulbs (and devices) to my home."
3.0,2 months ago,ebay.com,It needs improving.,"It would be great if the device had a physical button to control the volume. It's a pain to keep telling it to turn down the volume. It would also be nice to keep it powered on with a rechargeable battery, that way you won't have to keep it plugged in. And last, make all functions available for more countries. I'm in Puerto Rico and can't use the mini as a speaker with YouTube because it's not supported. Conclusion: most of the functions you can do using google assistant in your phone."
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Cute Little Assistant,"I was able to receive this for free when purchasing the Nest Thermostat. The mini ties in with other smart products and has been easy enough to connect and use, as long as it is compatible. There have been times when it's playing music a bit louder and can't hear me. So I'm shouting or repeating myself before it can help with the next task. I found I can make calls (with an iPhone) but the person on the other line can't hear me at all but I can hear them. So there are a few kinks to work out, but I still have enjoyed this little gift:)"
5.0,2 years ago,Target,LOVE the Mini!,"LOVE this little guy! I caught it while it was on Black Friday sale, so for $20 ($29.99 + $10 gift card) we get to try out the assistant market. The Mr. and I both use Google for mail, calendar, etc. so it made more sense to try it than Alexa. We have Sonos units throughout the house, so it's more for the queries, reminders, notes, and convenience aspects than for music/sound. That said it's become our best friend for weather forecasts, daily schedules, shopping list, and homework help for the munchkins. From a music/sound perspective, for the average user who is used to radio quality or computer broadcast music, this thing holds its own! PROS: Low $, Small footprint, pretty quick setup/learning, can handle multiple voices intelligently (though we haven't really tested this that much), handy when phone isn't available, etc., easier to control volume than Sonos when playing music, decent sound (for general kitchen listening while making dinner), etc. and it has a great sense of humor! Warnings: Our munchkins (7 and 9) want to talk to it all the time, so think through boundaries before introduction (didn't think that through...). AND when the girls say ""Hey Google, play music!"" it doesn't necessarily know to play G-rated music. I haven't taken the time to research how to set parameters on it, but I'm sure there probably is a way or it's a feature request that's on the drawing board. Also, be aware that for it to be an on-the-fly assistant, you must leave the microphone on/active all the time. Google's set-up quick start is pretty up front about this and provides a clear way for it to be turned off if privacy is a huge concern. (If privacy is of concern though, the smart assistant/smart home category probably isn't a good option anyway.) WE LOVE IT, and I may purchase a few more for my office and the living room before the holiday sales are finished.Less"
5.0,a year ago,lowes.com,Awesome product,"Wonderful product. Five stars as it works right out of the box with all you need. Even better if you have a smartphone, tablet, but not necessary. The Google home mini controls bulb with voice command. Very simple to install in any light fixture, and light switch still can be used as normal light fixture, to override smart function. With google home app you can manually turn light on with a remote like function and it’s dimmable. Very nice product, and allows one to have a smart home feature for a regular type home for a lighting fixture. Nice to have and easy to use. Great for seniors or disabled people to turn on lights with voice command."

The speaker is pretty loud, I can hear it from my front door when the volume is all the way up. The set up was super easy! I was done within 3minutes and that included the time it take for me to download the Googlet Home app. We also have an Amazon Echo but we hardly ever use it. Google Home Mini responds to more voice commands and gives more information about a wide range of things. I was surprised to find that I can broadcast a voice recorded message from my phone to the device to make an announcement to the room in which the device is stationed. That might be helpful for people with a large house, or a home with kids. The color is brilliant and goes well with my decor.

With the google home hub (about $125) in the master bedroom, this has given us the ability to have a smart home coming in at under $500.00! I wish the volume was a bit louder on the minis, but they are mini— and are easily heard in each individual room. Understands our speaking to it clearly and uses the commands you give quickly. Really good speaker for the price!"

Sounds great for a small speaker. Disappointed by laggy voice on Bluetooth audio with videos. No battery power either. Trying to find a better use for it. Currently no other smart devices to connect it with. I'd say it's worth the price though and pretty much does what it should.
1.0,3 months ago,lowes.com,Very disappointed,"I bought two of the Google Home Minis instead of purchasing the Amazon Dot and I now regret that choice. The Google Home Mini only allows you to access a select few streaming services and the voice command isn’t as reliable as the Amazon Dot. I am also disappointed at how I cannot stream one thing from multiple rooms unless I’m streaming directly from an app on my phone. The only thing that I did like about the Google Home Mini is that it matched my counter tops well, otherwise than that I feel like I wasted time and money on this product."

We chose the Google Smart Light Starter Kit with a Google Home Mini and a GE C-Life Smart Bulb to solve this problem. We first downloaded the Google Home app on our smart phone, launched it, and added our information. Then we plugged in the Mini and added it to our Home in the app after it connected to our WiFi. We put the C-Life bulb in the lamp we wanted to control and added it to our Home. Then we said, “OK, Google, turn on the light” and the bulb turned on. You can also turn on the bulb remotely with the Home app. The light can also be dimmed and brightened or turned on/off with a schedule set up in the Home app. No more stubbed toes trying to find the lamp in the dark.Less"

I use this daily to work smart plugs and ask it questions occasionally, there have been many issues with this not being able to answer the said questions. For Christmas my daughter kept asking me what I wanted, as I love gadgets I turned to the Very site for ideas. Seeing the Google mini on offer it was decided that I would be purchasing one. I have set it up, very easy to do, and so far very impressed with it. My son has had great fun asking the same question to the both devices, and the Google answers far better than the amazone echo.

I recently bought my boyfriend one and was worried because he does not have any smart lights or ChromeCast on his TV. However, he uses his more than I use mine!! He uses it to get a weather forecast every morning, catch up on his favorite sports teams, listen to music, and more!! I would definitely recommend this product to everyone!!

4.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Good. Morning Google!,"This is the Google equivalent of Alexa ( Amazon). Both sit on my bedside cabinet. Google was easy to set up. I use the device to set a daily alarm ( a nicer sound than Alexa’s) , and I have a simple morning routine which gives me the local time, weather and news bulletins. I adjusted the routine on my Google app. All conversations are noted ( as are those with Alexa), so you can see how they respond. Although supposedly endowed with artificial intelligence, you have to speak in a certain way to be understood. This can be fun or frustrating according to your mood! Although I can control my heating and hot water via Google , I’ve yet to use the app to its full potential. I do listen to spotify (free) music on Google but prefer my own playlists on Amazon ( free ) music."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Google Home mini Vs. Alexa Dot,"I was split between the Alexa Dot and the Google Home Mini, so I bought both to compare side by side, what the heck, only $29 each right? lol Anyway, I have smart outlets and LED color bulbs to play with and compare between the two devices. The sound difference between the two is night and day, with the Google Home mini winning hands down, sounding much richer and louder. Turning other smart devices on and off, they are both about the same. Asking each the same questions side by side, the Google Home won again. I think because the Google mini uses Google as a search engine, as compared to the Alexa Dot using Bing. But the Mini 9 out of 10 times has some sort of answer, where asked the same question to the Dot, most of the responses were ""I don't know that one"". If the google didn't know the answer, it would at least come back with a funny sarcastic answer, giving you something other than ""I don't know that one"" Now the last major part of the 2 devices is the ability to either cast audio of any kind to it, Yes or now, and being able to send the audio out the Dot or the Mini with the 3.5mm headphone jack. THe Dot has the ability to send its audio out with the 3.5mm jack, which sounds awesome by the way, where the Mini doesn't have this ability, Google wants you to cast to a Chromecast audio or Chromecast. Both can Bluetooth from your phone. So we decided to keep the DOT for the bedroom so we can control audio in the bedroom over a pair of PC speakers since the DOT had the 3.5mm out, and keep the Mini for the living room since we can cast to the TV's chromecast that we already have and the ability to cast audio on our phone to the Mini. They both have the positive sides, but if wanting to play audio out of the device by itself, the Google Mini sounds way better!!Less"
4.0,2 years ago,John Lewis,Smart Google Mini,"Taking the mini out of the box it looks smart, modern and compact. The base is rubberised and when responding 4 lights appear on the top. Mini needed to be plugged in and the app installed on your smart phone. When it came to pairing the phone (Samsung Galaxy S5) with the mini it wouldn’t create the initial connection. Whereas my partners phone (Samsung Galaxy S7) paired straight away and completed setup. Once this was done my phone worked correctly with the mini. The mini has clear sound and good voice definition, picking commands from a distance though it sometimes interrupts and if trained can recognise individual voices. After using the mini it feels like it’s still a work in progress, though from the looks of it new functionality is being added constantly. To get full functionality 3rd party smart devices are required. Unfortunately I don’t currently have though I think the Philips smart light bulbs, Chromecast TV control, and NEST heating control would be good. Another feature that is coming soon is the ability to make and receive calls. What you get straight out of the box is the ability to ask it facts, news, dictionary definitions, spell words, the weather, reads calendar entries, creates shopping lists, set timers and alarms, good night (puts it into night mode), good morning (can be setup to give you information). Very handy on traffic, advising how long it will take to get to work. To play music you’ll need to be subscribed to a music service that is available in the home app. It doesn’t appear to be able to play locally stored music although will play radio stations. I have found it more useful than what I thought and I am looking forward to new functionality. I would happily recommend.Less"
5.0,a year ago,walmart.com,Great deal! GREAT Products! EASY to use.,"The setup is remarkably easy! We bought two because they were on sale for $31 each. Normally the mini alone is $49!

Hopefully the electric bill will go down with us able to monitor the lights even from an hour away! The ""goodnight"" and ""goodmorning"" phrases are set to perform specific actions and you can broadcast a message from any device! We have bought 2 extra bulbs and a smart plug since this purchase!

It works with most of the music services but not with Amazon Prime. This one came with a GE C-Life LED smart bulb with 760 lumens.

Won’t play uploaded albums by name unless I have them added to a playlist, and even then is iffy. Wish I could wake to a song like with the echo dot. Also wish I could access prime music. However, the sound is definitely superior to the dot. I do wish it had the option of playing out through another speaker either through aux or Bluetooth like the dot.

Many of the skills offered were things that I never really would use. So I decided to give the mini a try. I've had it for almost 5 months, and now have them throughout the house. One by my TV, one in the kitchen, one in the bedroom, and one in the bathroom. I find it responds to questions quickly, you can ask it more detailed weather. If looking for music, it has a better understanding of your commands than the echo dot. The devices have decent sound, and you don't need to add skills for every little inquiry.

5.0,a year ago,Target,Awesome!,Super excited to try out Smart light starter kit with google home mini. It was easy to take out of box and connect to phone and light. Having to get up and turn light off when watching a movie with the kids will no longer be problem. My kids love talking to google to dim the lights while we watch television when we all sit as a family. What a great way to save energy and light. Teaching my kids the importance of this just got easier. Turning the alarm on the turn light on is amazing who would have thought that was possible and have light when you wake up to go to work. I love it and glad I had the opportunity to try it out. I recommend this for everyone who wants to save energy and have lights dimmed or turned off without getting up from the couch.
4.0,2 years ago,Bed Bath & Beyond,Good but Not Great,"How much you like your Google Home Mini depends on how you plan to use it. I've had two Echo Dots for a year and this Google Home Mini for several weeks. I use my devices for home automation and to answer questions. Amazon Echo devices are way ahead of Google Home devices in the automation arena. Yes you can tell both to turn on and off or dim lights, but I can tell my Echo Dots to turn in ""scenes"" I've setup with my Philips Hue lights. Google Home doesn't seem to support this. Same for the automation I've setup with my Logitech Harmony to control my TV, blu-ray and AV system. Amazon Echo devices cleanly support my Harmony macros and channel favorites, etc. I haven't seen that Google Home supports Harmony macros, but it does allow me to do some things like increase or decrease TV volume. Also, Echo supports Bluetooth speakers, so it's easy to improve the soung. It appears my Google Home Mini only supports Chromecast devices, which I have none. Google Home is better at answering questions and understanding me in noisy rooms, as well as setting up and differentiating multiple people. (Echo devices used to be really bad at answering questions, but the gap is really small now.) Also seems like Google Home is slightly better suited to calling people and local businesses, but I haven't deeply explored this area. I only use my phone to make calls, since I'm not that excited about sharing my contacts with either Amazon or Google. Overall, Amazon Echo is a better fit for me, but Google Home might be better for you if you aren't focused on home automation.Less"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"a little rocky at first, but great now","I've had this for about a year now and ran into some early integration issues. I had about 4 scattered across the house, but some would respond to commands and some wouldn't. I basically had to reset all of them and start from scratch to get my wemo switches to talk to all of them reliably. Since then, with software updates and app updates, the system is more reliable. The addition of routines allow one to string together multiple commands. For example, I have a single goodnight command that sets the alarm, reassures me the garage door is closed, tells me the inside temperature, and plays some crashing ocean waves for white noise for 45 minutes as I drop off to sleep. If you don't need google voice calling, look for the insignia units on sale. They are a great alternative for half the price.Less"

After a fast read of the Quick Start Guide; I downloaded Google home on my Iphone 6s and found that the app walked me through the complete setup without need for the instructions. It offered many options on set up and how some things could be set up when asking Google. The Google Mini itself never seemed to fail in anyway to impress me. No matter what I asked (even if goofy) it gave up the information, had a reply, or suggestions on how I might ask it for a better response. The list of things it was able to offer seems endless and I cannot think of anything it lacked.

I had to download the Google home app on my phone and answer a few simple questions on the app. I can now control the lamp with my voice, ask Google what the weather forecast is, stream my Google music service, and ask Google the answer to my kids random questions.

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Heres my honest unbiased review of the mini...,"Ok, so i bought this because a guy at work had one and i thought it was pretty cool that he was checking on sports scores and weather reports and playing his spotify on etc.. i downloaded the app on my phone which was quick and painless then synced it with my gmail and spotify account while checking and adjusting settings for the device. About using the google mini, I like that you can check the weather, time, set a timer, ask simple questions and do mad libs etc.. I dont like that a long question gets a ""i can not answer that right now, I am still learning"" answer from the device. Also i didn;t like that another android user can pause or start the song you were playing via their phone. Hopefully just a missed setting on my part. Hopefully that will change in time. It seems to answer basic math questions easily and can answer info on places around town like hours of operation etc. We were sitting around one night just talking and all of a sudden the google home mini just said ""Cool"" out of the blue which was pretty odd so i unplug mine when not using it. The kids like asking it to play songs which i am kind of confused about. I was under the impression it only answered to the owners voice but maybe this is a setting i missed somewhere. All in all its a pretty cool device and i am still figuring things out about it so i would recommend this item to a friend. Hoping in the future it can answer longer questions like talking to google on your phone does. If not i will just use it to play spotify on at work and check simple answers like i originally intended it to be used for. There is quite a bit you can do like chrome casts and lighting in your house settings but they require other adapters etc which i just havent got to explore as of yet...Less"
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Best $30 I could have spent,"My parents just got an echo dot for Christmas from my uncle, I was jealous so I bought this. Reason I bought this over an echo dot is because... well... #GoogleMasterRace. I have not been disappointed. Sure there are a few things you cant do yet, but based on the past three weeks of use between the dot and the mini, I can say for certain that Google's capability to answer questions and overall knowledge are superior to Amazons. It's using Google's search database after all... simple questions you would think Alexa - the ""voice assistant"" - should be able to answer... well it can't sometimes! Come on Alexa, you can't even tell me how much traffic is on the 91... are you kidding me? Furthermore, the voice recognition is, at least to me, better on the mini. The echo dot leaves you no time to stop and think about what your saying. You have barely any time to hesitate when giving a command or it will cut you off. You don't mind it until you try the mini; the google assistant is far more laid back. On top of all that, the speaker is a poor joke on the dot compared to this one's (neither are the best mind you, but the mini's just sounds ""meatier""). Lastly, the mini works seamlessly/syncs with my main google account on my phone and computer. Reminders and appointments I input into the mini via voice are all available on the default calendar on my phone and not through some Amazon app. Also, I can actually call anyone on my contacts as long as I have that contact synced to my google account, and you can even call local businesses/establishments. The echo dot doesn't let you call anyone unless they download the amazon echo app onto their phone; at least that how it works at the time of this review. All in all, what you should take from this review is that Google Home/Mini are probably the voice assistant you are expecting to buy when you buy an Echo. I have come to this conclusion based on MY experience with both the Amazon and the Google voice assistant for the past two-something weeks, so sorry if I hurt your feelings Amazonians. Lastly, I would like to add that you experience with the Google assistant will be all the more better the more you use your google account in your everyday life. If you buy one and have to start a google account from scratch, you gonna have some work to do before the experience becomes ""seamless"".Less"

They love asking 4 knock knock jokes and to play their favorite songs. They used their own money to buy them, but we'll be taking these back. The controls on these devices are not sufficient for suppressing inappropriate content for young audiences. We adjusted the settings in the app to restrict explicit content, but music with totally inappropriate lyrics still comes through. Also, Google music is inferior to Amazon music. I love Google. I have a Google phone and I have been very happy with it, but these were not good for the purpose/audience for which we intended them."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Simple and Easy Starter kit for home automation,If you want to get started with home automation and don't know where to begin. This bundle is for you. You get the GE c-life bulb and the Google mini bundled at one incredible price. One makes this bundle appealing is that the GE C-Life bulbs do not require the use of a hub. You set up the Google mini using the intuitive Home app and screw in the included light bulb. Finish the setup in the Google Home app resulting in a voice-activated bulb. The lights are bright and relatively inexpensive. The C-Life series is growing with other types of bulbs and accessories which makes the whole purchase very worthwhile and a worthy competitor.

I didn't think I'd even open the box which is how disinterested I was in the product. Simply put, I was wrong. I now kick myself for not buying one earlier. Incredibly easy setup, it looks good on the TV console, and it does its job well. I use Google apps so I'm glad I was offered this unit rather than its competition. I would say if you are thinking about creating a smart home, this is a good place to start. I have a smart plug on order so I can control a living room light and will be expanding the plugs to other rooms of the house. And for being a small unit, the sound quality is pretty impressive.Less"

I don't wanna be forced to subscribe to their monthly service just to play songs that I already own. It don't take or understand commands no more. It don't realize what's already linked to it. What's strange is, when I give the same command to my google Assistant on my phone, it works every time. But don't ever work even i use my google home or my 5 google mini's. Save your money and just use your phone google Assistant. Because google home or mini does not work.

3.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,"Really awesome, sad about the defect","I have a full sized google home in the kitchen, and I got this little guy for my bed side table. The look of it is sleek, and it works exactly like the big one does. The speaker isn’t as good as the big one, but it’s a quarter of the size, so that’s understandable. What I’m not happy about is the defect on the top touch pad of the device. One of the main pieces of functionality of this tech is to be able to touch the top of the device to pause, play, stop alarms, and generally interact. From the research I’ve done, before these even released, when they were giving a few out to lucky winners as promos, there was an issue with a “ghost touch.” It was causing the google to think that the top was being touched, so you’d have it saying weird things to you all day, and pretty much listening to you all day. From what I’ve read online, there were not a lot of people affected by this defect, but google went ahead with the launch instead of recalling the affected devices. They then issued a software update for ALL users that completely disabled the ability to use the top as an interaction button (you can still tap on either side to change the volume). This forces the user to use all voice commands to interact with the device. Which can be a pain in the butt sometimes. So the first day I got this product, I set it as my alarm clock, and you can imagine what I looked like at 6 am, trying to beat this thing until it turned off. I finally had to use voice control to get it turned off. But I was used to my full sized google home and I was expecting it to turn off when I touched the top pad. I’ve heard word that they might recall all of these devices, but I really hope not. Outside of that, it’s great. I just really hope google figures out something soon.Less"

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Nice price for a helpful device,"I have a few other Google devices in my possession (Chromecast video, audio, router) so I am fairly familiar with Google, their products, and how they operate. The Google Home Mini was fairly easy to set up, connect to the internet and have it running. It's pretty good at setting alarms, playing my music from Spotify, iHeart radio and Tune In, answering basic questions about current events, news, weather and directions. I would like it to perform some home automation features like turn on and off my TV, control my light bulbs (illumi brand), and locate my car using the Automatic adapter. I know this device is one that they will provide updates, improve over time and add features for an ever expanding array of smart products. I'm just hoping some of the features I want are available soon or provided before they move on and develop something else making the Mini obsolete. The price of entry is not bad at $29.99. It also functions well as a small speaker. I have it placed on my bedside table and it loud enough and can handle a decent range of highs, midrange and bass without distorting at mid volume. The alarm does a good job of waking you up but not sounding obnoxious. If I could add or suggest improvements/must haves, I would: 1. Like a way to wall mount the device 2. More colors available in store (I've seen a red version but the only offer the chalk or charcoal colors at Best Buy). How about offering them in the Google colors? 3. I have another device with the Google assistant built in. When I say' ""Hey Google"", both devices respond. How do you get a particular device to respond without having the other one respond (other than turning off the mic)?

5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Makes a great nightstand speaker/alarm,"After owning the full size Google Home, I was interested in the Google Home Mini for my nightstand to use as a Bluetooth speaker and alarm clock. When Black Friday came around and the price dropped to $29 I had to pick it up. Set up is a breeze with the Google Home Mini functioning in a few taps of the app. For my purposes this works perfect. A small speaker that can get reasonably loud in my bedroom. The sound isn't great, but at low volumes it's pleasant and clear. I purchased the Chromecast Audio to stream over wifi to my bedroom stereo for better sound. The voice integration works great. Now when I walk in my room I have the ability to start up the music on either the Google Home Mini or my bedroom stereo all by voice or by smart phone or tablet. I also have a Chromecast which can be operated by voice, but I think it's much better to use your smart phone or tablet. Easy to set the alarm by just telling it to set an alarm. I'm debating adding a Wemo switch to make my lights voice activated like I've done in my living room. All the other Google Assistant stuff is just an added bonus. One thing that makes the Google Home Products stand out in my mind is the ability to ask more complex questions. With Alexa I can ask fairly simple questions and she can't understand what I'm trying to ask. Google is much better with this. Another great thing is that Google regularly updates the product to add new features. Since I've had my Google Home they've added Bluetooth streaming, equalizer, new games and activities. At this price point, this product is awesome and will get better with time. What would make it better is a 3.5mm jack so I don't have to buy an additional Google product to connect it to my stereo.Less"

Secondly, the google can’t take multiple commands at once, so you can’t say “hey google, turn the light on at 40%”.. you have to say “hey google turn the light on” then “hey google dim the light to 40%” which blinds me in the morning. The google mini is everything expected in a virtual assistant, has lots of things it can do and some quirky things it can’t. I would recommend for the price though.Less"

Speakers sound okay, but not great. The assistant works well when I ask it something, but often goes off when I'm just talking on the phone. If you have an entirely automated Google Home setup I could see this being an great value and could recommend this for that application, but if you are purchasing a single speaker to tell you about the weather or listen to music you'd be better off just using your phone and it's an easy pass for me. The build quality is good, it has an ok weight to it, blends in and the LED lights on top are nice.

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Good for Home Automation,"This one is simple: If you already invested in a few Amazon products like the Fire Stick and Echo and Echo Dot/Show/Spot, then keep using those products. If you use Google products like the Play Music subscription, Chromecast and the Google Assistant, then using the Google Home might be a better solution. I previously had 3 Echo dot around my house but found my self wanting to make the most use out of my Chromecast and Music subscription. Seeing as only Google supports their own music service, I replaced the Dots with some Home Minis. Setup was very easy. Use the Google Home app and it will find the Home Mini like a Chromecast. You can then set up additional features and link other accounts. If you do home automation, this is when you link your hub and create rooms and place your switches and sensors in each rooms. The Home is better than Echo dot at understanding what you want. It also can recognize your voice a lot better that the Echo. While Amazon, has had their products for a long time, Google clearly wins when it comes to being the best assistant. The speakers on the Home mini are much louder than an Echo Dot. And I mean much much louder. The difference is incredible. I used to run the Echo do on max volume and it was pretty disappointing. With the Home mini, even at half volume, it is kind of loud. It'll do much better at playing music. I do wish that the Home Mini would take a USB-C to power but since the power supply is included, it doesn't really bother me that much. Overall, this is a good device for use with home automation and playing music and being loud in general. I prefer it a lot more over the Echo Dot and I will probably get a 4th one for the guest room.Less"

It's like having a trivia answer card at your fingertips. I'm still trying to figure it out so that I can make doctors appointments, phone calls, reservations at a restaurant, etc. it was an expensive item so I don't regret buying it. I am a little anxious and maybe even paranoid about all the talk of how google can and will record your conversations but honestly we're not the CIA, criminals or have deep secrets so let it record, I have gotten in the habit of unplugging it at night or if I want to have a private conversation.

Now on day 2 I'm doing the 180 degree thing because of how it (she) pulls me deeper into allowing I to flex my thinking or could I say expand her usefulness and uselessness for me. For example, I already have Lutron light switches that with the aid of Lutron's app automates my lighting or ""scenes"" to turn on and off the lights at intervals I create. Google (she) enhances this by giving me full control of lighting (dimness/on-off, color) per voice! She must be within ear shot albeit but she's pretty good at listening over noise at great distance. Streaming Tunein Radio al'la voice won me over instantly and was the single most thing that sold me thank you very much. Sounds quality is exactly on par with what you could expect from a donut, it's listenable all day and never made me feel that feeling of regret that other devices have given me. Do note that it doesn't have an internal battery making it a speaker that always (at least what the instructions said), needs to be plugged into the included power adapter to work. This is not entirely true as I learned. Being that it has micro - usb to power it I connected the donut to a portable battery phone charger (10,000 mah) and it played all day today while I worked on my deck. The charger burned 1 bar (of 4) of power! BONUS. All said it feels like it would if you could have Scotty ""beam me up"". In other words it's a very powerful yet very fun donut.Less"

So after a while we are both hooked, and we got the Philips hue and now we're looking into the smart kettle (but no tea making robot as yet) The Google Home itself has a nice feel and build, for using it solely as a music speaker would be alright but I wouldn't recommend, it's ok for the odd snippet of music and the Google assistant is very clear with this little mini. Overall I'm glad we got one, I enjoy the morning BBC news and Google calendar notifications and the great thing is they will keep adding additional services and products to the line up.

Other, more expensive bulbs can change color and are a bit more versatile, but that's part of why this is a starter kit.

3.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,It's OK,"So I own three Echo Dots, and three Home Minis. They are comparable, but there are some important differences. First of all, I'm a Google Music subscriber, so the mini was a necessity, if I wanted to listen to my music on one of these devices. The sound is just OK, but better than the Echo Dot. It definitely isn't a replacement for a good music device, but in a pinch, it works. Unfortunately, unlike the Dot, it won't connect to external Bluetooth speakers, without owning a Google music dongle. Even then, you'd have to plug in the BT speaker, AND the dongle, so... Also, when it comes to hearing you, over the background noise of its own music, or over the TV, or really over anything, the Mini fails miserably, in comparison to the Dot. For home devices, this, like the Dot, supported everything I had. For some things, like my thermostat, I can ask this what the temperature on the main floor is, and it will know, where my Dot doesn't seem to understand, but pound for pound, it's about equivalent. The Dot gives you, seemingly, a little more leeway on how you describe what you want it to do. Some of the features on the mini, like reading my appointments, etc., doesn't work, because I have a pro/business account for my gmail/calendar/etc. (you pay for their services, so you get less features, and less compatibility, right?)

What really sold me on this was the combatability with Chromecast and Youtube TV. I can tell the Google home to put on NBC on my TV and it works really well.

5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Life is getting better with assistants,"We already own an Amazon Echo & Dot, so I wanted a Google Home Mini on another floor to control Hue lights, and to compare with the Echo. They are basically the same and all work well. The speaker on the Mini is better than the speaker on the Dot, and the microphone on the Mini seems to be better at picking up voice in a noisy room. Where the Home Mini excels is with questions you would ask Google search engine, including questions about traffic and distance, and general trivia, etc. It often takes Echo several tries, asking in different ways until a question is clear enough for the machine to understand. But the Home Mini usually gets it right away, and responds quicker (probably due to Google's experience with search engine and voice recognition technology.) For stuff like this, the Google product is great. Initial integration with my Philips Hue lights and my Logitech Harmony was easier on the Amazon devices, and as I recall, Amazon didn't ask for as much personal info as the Google Home setup requires. I eventually figured out how to integrate Hue & Harmony with my Home Mini, but it wasn't nearly as intuitive as integration with the Amazon devices was. The Home Mini does seem quicker to change my lights (on/off, colors, dimming), than the Echo or Dot, though.

LIKE: Connected immediately to YouTube (I pay for red) when signing in with my existing google account and it immediately picked up my preferences. *DING, DING* plus 2 stars! (Amazon Music has proven fairly restrictive & often shifted prime songs in and out of their basic Prime inclusion: trying to force an additional prime music subscription, which I refuse to do, considering I already pay for Prime.

It's voice recognition is SOOO much better than my original regular sized Google Assistant, but probably still doesn't live up to an Alexa. My kids love to ask it to tell them jokes. It could definitely use some more comedic material. Overall, it is definitely worth the sale price."
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,google home mini vs alexa echo dot,"I had the echo dot for over a year before I bought the google home mini. I bought it because sometimes I'll ask Alexa questions that I'll have to google because it doesn't know the answer. But as time went on Alexa has been improved and can answer a whole lot more than when I originally bought it. I ask both of them the same questions and they pretty much give me the same answers. Maybe google will give a little more details but so far there has only been a couple of questions that google knew over Alexa. But if you have prime Alexa is the choice hands down. They have tons of free music and if you have a fire stick or tv tons of free movies as well. So if you don't have prime, google is the way to go. It can connect to bluetooth devices, control smart devices, deliver custom news feeds, set up calendars, make lists, tell jokes, sing songs and play games just the same as the echo dot. I like the Alexa app and the google home app is pretty good also. The big difference is amazon prime. I don't subscribe to any google services other than gmail and youtube but it seems like you can utilize the google drive to upload music and play it through the google mini. I have done this with Alexa. I have bought albums on Amazon and some have digital mp3's of the album that you can stream at anytime off of the dot. You can favorite playlists on Amazon and both can play from pandora and spotify just the same. So there you go if you have prime the Amazon devices are for you if not google will allow you to do all the same things as the Alexa devices.Less"
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,It's ok but prefer the Echo Dot,"It's definitely lacking the ability to connect to bluetooth speakers and there is no 3.5 mm audio jack. The Echo Dot since version one had these features. However, don't discount the Google Home mini. What it lacks in features, it gains in great responses from Google Assistant. A lot of times it would answer questions Alexa wouldn't know. The speaker is loud and the mic picks up my voice across the room easily. The touch controls are decent but physical controls would of been much better. Granted I got this with a deal (free via buying Tile Pro), I do enjoy it. It also doesn't have as many apps/skills compared to Alexa, but an ok option if you are all in with Google. Wait for a sale or a free deal."
4.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Great for a simple smart home device,Having a smart home device is great. Having multiple is even better. These mini's allow me to have one in every room basically. They capture sound commands well and playback sound at a decent decibel for being so compact. My one complaint would be the touch controls. They aren't as fluent as in the larger Google products. Voice works fantastic and controls many devices with ease.
4.0,a year ago,ebay.com,GOOGLE HOME MINI,"Still getting to grips with it. It was very easy to set up and get going. There is a lot it cannot answer but it does tell you ""I don't have an answer but I am still learning"". Sometimes It is not always easy to get it to wake up, but that could be because it has not recognised my voice or the tone of my voice. On the other hand it is situated very close to one of my tv speakers and a couple of times it has reacted to that. My friends who have seen it are initially very amused, then realise what it can do and the speed it does it at. I do believe that as a result of my unit they will be buying one for themselves. Overall I believe that in the future this type of thing will be as popular as the mobile phone or iPad type devices. Its a pity that at the moment add on units to control other things in the home are so expensive. I give it a thumbs up and would recommend it to anybody.Less"

All in all id say this package is better than its main competitor. One major pro is that the set up is a breeze. I had these bulbs installed and running in about 3 minutes. Secondly, i enjoyed the in app adjustability to the bulbs, some other apps do not offer this, these do. Bulbs are hard to mess up, but these bulbs have been outstanding, and so far (fingers crossed) long lasting. One thing I didn't care about the hub was the speaker, it was a little faint and pushed out too much trebble in my opinion. Only a slight negative. All in all a pretty decent starter package for the novice and above"

I have Lutron (lights and shades), Ecobee (Thermostat), b-hyve (sprinklers) and Chamberlain (Garage doors). I have 4 Alexas and I bought the mini to compare it. The integration with other devices is easy in both speakers. I think that Google gives you better answers as an assistant, but lacks some features that Alexa has integrating other automation devices. The google mini has better integration with my Samsung phone and Sony TV. It is hard to decide which one is better. And the problem of having both speakers, is that I change their names all the time.... well, that happen with my daughters too."
5.0,2 years ago,walmart.com,Great Device,"I recommend the Google Home Mini for anyone. I have always wanted one but the price was never in my price range but for the whole month of December in 2017, the Google Home devices were on sale. Before buying this item, I read a lot of reviews on the original Google Home and the Google Home Mini because I did not want to buy it without other buyers’ opinion on both of the items. I am so glad I read reviews because I would have bought the original Google Home because ‘bigger is better’ but in this case the Google Home Mini would meet my needs. The Google Home Mini is much cheaper than the original and I feel as if the Google Home Mini is much easier to access. It is so much smaller than the original so it is much easier to make space for it throughout your home. The set-up takes about five minutes to complete. So much easier than any other device I have had to set-up. It plays my favorite songs and bands when I ask it to play them. It answers questions that I ask in a split of a second. It plays games such as Mad Gabs, Trivia Games and so much more. You will never get bored when talking to the Google Home Mini. The only thing that is negative is that it does not work when there is no WIFI or when the WIFI is not working very well. I have loved having the Google Home Mini in my college dorm because it will help me with whatever questions I have and it plays music for me as soon as I say “OK Google”. I recommend this device for anyone who is looking for a cheap smart device because it fits my everyday needs.Less"

Being able to ask about my commute to work or a particular location is really convenient because i can gauge how much time i need to get there, and the Google Home takes it a step further by sending directions to my iPhone. I also found the integration process for various smart-home devices extremely painless. I've managed to integrate smart outlets from what seemed like a no-name brand with my Samsung SmartThings hub (and water leak sensors, plus one more power outlet) and finally, my ADT security system. Everything works flawlessly. I was actually so pleased by my experience with this Google Mini i bought two more. Now i have one in our master bathroom, our kitchen, and in the officeLess"

Temperature and weather forecast are as easy as ""hey google what is the temperature outside"". Even at Christmas time it was easy to hear Christmas music. I would recommend this to anyone if you have WiFi access in your home/apartment. After trying out this Mini, My wife and I purchased one for her Mother.

5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Awesome and matches daughter's color scheme,"I already provided a glowing review of a black home mini because it's much better than its competition in terms of virtual assistants. SIRI is useless (for good reason, Apple's user privacy is more robust, meaning their machine learning spies less and therefore learns less), and Alexa doesn't have the advantage of Google's search query data to train its machine learning. Anyway, the coral color is great in my daughter's room... chicks love coral."

Google wont stand behind the bulb because I bought it through a 3rd party. Google will not support your Google items unless they have been purchased through Google. Beware"

All I have done so far was talking to the device and it does what I ask with the weather even popping up on occasion which is what I was looking at. I like the fact that it sync to my devices with the calendar update with the busy schedule I have. I have multiple units which they talked back-and-forth to each other so you’re not using different accounts to accommodate one unit. I would recommend this little device for not only sound of the ease of use make up as we make your life simple and up-to-date if you carry a busy workload. Set a reminder and it will remind you even with a little music.

I want to say that constantly having my hands full, whether it be with my son or all of the stuff from our house, the ability to control the lights with my voice is such a convenience. I really like having the Google Assistant as well which was super easy to set up and offers some surprisingly good sound from such a small hub. I like being able to schedule when the lights go on and off, this way eliminating the chance at wasting energy. There are also programmable tasks that you can teach the Google mini to do with just a simple command phrase that you can select! Overall it's a really cool product to have in your house and I definitely would recommend it"
5.0,2 years ago,Target,What a great little gadget to have! I love mine!,"I bought an Alexa a year ago and have really enjoyed it. However, watching Google Home ads I tried to get answers for some of the things Google Home was able to answer. Hmmm Alexa wasn't so great or helpful. I wanted to get another one for my bedroom, saw that Google Home was on sale and bought it. Well I love love love my Google Home Mini. It's speaker is much louder than Alexa's. Google has a broader knowledge base and you don't have to enable a ton of different apps like you do on Alexa. The speakers are much louder than Amazon's echo dot so I don't need to pair it with another speaker to hear in other rooms. I like that the music streams without problems, on my Alexa it seemed to loose connections a lot. Echo dot doesn't always hear my commands even though I am right there. Google seems to hear me much easier and responds so much quicker. I must say though I do like how Echo will ding when you say it's name so you know she is listening, Google doesnt make a sound but will light up when it hears you. So if you can't actually see the lights you aren't sure it heard you. The device is well made and attractive. Needless to say I bought several more to give as gifts and one more to put in my bedroom so I can listen to music or a podcast while getting dressed or getting ready for bed. I like my Echo Dot it's got some good features especially when you are a prime member; however, I am much more impressed by Google Home and highly recommend it. Now over the next year I will be buying some of the home automation gadgets to see which device they work best with. I have a feeling that one will be definitely much better than the other. :)Less"
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Very good - better than Echo Dot for me.,"I started out looking for an inexpensive way to add auto-on/auto-sleep Chromecast Audio speakers around the house so I wouldn't have listening gaps when I moved away from my usual listening location. Sound quality didn't need to be super good, just ""good enough"" - I wanted continuity without pain, not enhanced pleasure. Voice input started out as a disqualifier in my searching; I have Android Auto in my car, and found voice input there to be mostly pain and little gain. But in the twists and turns of my researches, I found that I wasn't going to be paying extra for it, and decided to give it a try. To my immediate and ever growing delight. The sound quality is better than I had hoped for. Google Assistant is much better than what I had in the car (full Google Assistant just came with a recent upgrade, and in-home is a better environment for exploring intelligent assistants). So much so that I now have an Echo Dot as well. The Mini is a much better device than the Dot. In function, there is a lot of overlap, but also some useful differences. I wouldn't want Alexa instead of Google Assistant, but Echo complements Google Home nicely. In the long run, I expect that Google Home Minis will spread themselves throughout the house, accompanied by one, or maybe two, Echo Dots.Less"

I've been with Alexa for quite a long while now and am an avid fan. Google Mini is very well built and cosmetically very pleasing. Lack of controls is a little concerning but all defaults are exceptionally good. The sound quality is remarkable and has plenty of volume. The 'assistant' is excellent and the unit displays a very powerful data base. I am most impressed with the performance so far and it represents excellent value for money. Having some issues with Sonos speakers for example - can't get the unit to recognise them. Most probably user error! Wouldn't hesitate in recommending this unit. Full 5 Stars - Well Done Google.

If you don't, it won't do you any good at all. It plays music with decent (no one would say ""good"") sound. This is especially good if you have Google Play Music or Pandora, in which case you can tell it exactly the music you want to hear, or the kind of music (""Hey Google, play Chicago II"", or ""Hey Google, play 70s slow dance music""). If you have Chrome TV, you can use voice commands to select programs on some channels, notably Netflix (no surprise, it doesn't work with Amazon Prime). It will give you the current time or temperature, or the forecast, or tell you what traffic will be like on your route to work. You can tell it items to add to your shopping list, and check the items off on your phone at the store, as you put them into the buggy. It will tell you bad jokes -- some so bad they're pretty good. :) It will play trivia (and I think other games) with you. It will sit practically anywhere (we have it on a high shelf, where we can't really see it). It just needs to have its power cord plugged in, and be within hearing range. if you have more than one, you can network them together. The best use we've found for that so far is that we can send music from our phones to all of the units in the house, so we can listen as we go from room to room. I suspect there are other things -- maybe a way to use them as an intercom; it seems like that ought to be possible, but we haven't yet found a way.

I have a couple of original Home speakers - one in my living room, and one in my bedroom, and a few Home Mini speakers - in the kitchen and in the bathroom. The regular Home speakers have better audio, which is why they're in the rooms I'm in most and am most inclined to listen to music, but the Minis aren't bad! They're pretty good, and since they're all linked up, I can fill my house with music. It's also great for weather, adding reminders, checking my calendar, and asking all sorts of questions - it's powered by Google, after all. The personality is great. Packed with jokes, games, and other good bits of entertainment. We gave a bunch of these for the holidays. Great gift!"
4.0,a year ago,lowes.com,decent value,"I got this on sale for 25$ and its a great value (since its hard to find just the google home mini for that price). The lightbulb was super fast to install with google home, but I can't find it in the c by ge app (so if you already have c by ge products you may want to install it using those directions instead of the directions in the box and that means I can only use google to control the bulb and not amazon's alexa). I've found google is a little better than alexa at understanding what your trying to do (alexa needs you to say exact phrases, while google can ""understand"" sentances a little better that aren't exactly the trigger phrase). Sound quality is what you'd expect from a speaker that size. Light bulb is dimmable: you can say ""hey google, turn 'window lamp' to 50 percent"" and it'll dim (window lamp is what I renamed my lightbulb), and the google home app has a slider to adjust.Less"

So easy to use even my grand-daughter uses it to answer her questions. I would highly recommend this product. I have found out that it easily recognized all the voices in our family after following the installation instructions. Easy to install and use. Installation took less than 10 minutes from unwrapping to use."

Improvements: Linking to Chromecast is wonderful. Would suggest Google link up YouTube playlists to the Home so it plays them straight to the Chromecast. One feature with Spotify if you are on a basic account, skipping song (forward or back) is not available. I don't need Spotify premium for all the family. Con: Voice Recognition is poor.

It can even play the music from a Youtube video if you ask it correctly. If you have a bunch of devices set up on a Google Home network, you can control them from this Google Mini. Another really cool feature is if you have multiple Google speakers set up around the house you can give them a ""broadcast"" command. Ex.

The Home Mini can also answer above average questions, it can also tell the time, weather, traffic, set alarms and timers and interact with some smarthome devices. Overall, I like the Home Mini and Google Home alot. P.S. I also have the DOT, but my wife and I like the Google Home products a lot better. In fact my wife and I have gotten emotionally upset at the DOT numerous times LOL because the DOT made so many mistakes, or was unable to answer some basic questions, or refered us to the ALEXA HELP APP, or asked us to repeat the request, or would play the wrong requested song, and would stop working altogether at times for days.

First off, for $30 you are getting access to the google home platform without having to purchase a $100 speaker or any other equipment. Just this lone mini can handle the functionality of it all (I actually have 2 of these bad boys). Second, I believe Google Home is superior to Amazon Alexa solely in the fact that Google is a database driven search company, vs Amazon being a primary retail shopping company that is starting to diverge into software and electronics. As far as “future-proofing goes” if I had to bet, I’d say Goohle’s software will eventually pull away from Amazon. And the fact that your kid can’t accidentally purchase something through Amazon with this is kind of nice. I recommend this product 100%."

For being as small as it is, it actually puts out a good amount of sound, although we use it to connect to our Sonos speakers that are already connected to our wifi.

There are some very useful and fun programs in it.. however I have noticed a couple issues. One of them is the lack of durability of the speaker cover.. I have not had my mini for even a month, and there are two holes in the speaker cover. Another complaint I have is how expensive Google play music is. It is roughly 5 dollars more a month than Amazon prime. Which provides me with tone of music at no additional charge, and does not include books, movies or free shipping.. that is just not a good value by comparison. Overall though, I do recommend it, and am quite fond of mine."

Whether I use my voice with google home or I use the google app -the light bulb responds in less than one second to my request.

2.0,2 years ago,Currys,Andrew's review of Google Home Mini,"Pros: Mmm ok , small speaker, not to bad a sound . Pretty straight forward to set up . Cons: So to the meat of it , as an early adopter to the echo system I have had pretty great reviews of the echo line , in fact until you do a side by side comparison the glaring disadvantages don’t become clear . Just let me say I only bought the Google pebble due to there being no stock of any Echo dot available until the end of this month ,so shows who bought what at Christmas! Also there was a deal if you bought 3 you got a major discount,,,,, god knows I love major discounts.)*So to the reason I actually bought the Pebble , it was to connect with my car ,something you can do pretty easily with the Echo dot or so it seems ,I have yet to do that install.On opening the Google product ,it is ergonomic indeed but does not have the finish of the echo, it also does not have an Auxiliary out jack ,something that echo has on most of its products, yes you can blue tooth to a google product (speakers or chrome on computer ) but not to any old Bluetooth speaker ( limiting to say he least ) .On trying to connect to the car via my phones hot spot ,a big no can do .it will pick up the signal sometimes but after talking to a Google Home tech that particular connection is only used for some sort of testing form googles end ,hell if I could get my head around that ,plus of course there isn’t any auxiliary connection for me to connect to my car that way and as stated the blue tooth only works with Google products(duh!!! It’s 2018 it’s supposed to be a smart assistant).On to the Home use , I had several glitches with the assistants voice, on the app there seems to be two choices but on testing which one I wanted they were the same pleasant female tones.Somehow I did manage to get a male voice but it seems arbitrary as to when either one will be talking. At this point I think I got the males voice on initial set up.I guess the main bugaboo with the Pebble is that it’s too proprietary to googles ecosystem ,something I am still scratching my head about,but as a sheepish google tech admitted,google was playing the catch up game . So at present I’m all in with The Amazon echo line , Amazon please hear me when I say don’t drop the ball ( got the echo with video ,not so good at making out what I want at a distance please fix!!!) as to connectivity for smart products , I have yet to see which is better with handling those things . Hope this helps .Less"

It was very easy to setup, doesn't take up much space, and has a nice sound for its size. I first downloaded the Google Home app on my smart phone, launched it, and added my information. Then I plugged in the Mini and added it to the Home in the app after it connected to the WiFi. As a test, I asked the Assistant what the weather forecast was and it told me. I haven’t used the Mini as an alarm clock yet but I will. I haven’t had it very long but I’m looking forward to learning about all the other ways I can use the Mini and Google Assistant."

I was under the impression that the Google Home Mini would be able to access YouTube Music Premium as long as I had it. I didn't expect to get it on other devices, just that I'd be able to use it with the Home Mini to play music. To say that it's free in the title is purposefully misleading. You get a YouTube Music Premium free trial. If you scroll down to the fine print (which I didn't do until I already purchased and received the order), you get a 14-day trial that extends to a 3-month trial. Then, further down, it says 6 months for some reason. I tried contacting customer support and they told me to call Google.

5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,If you love all things Google...,"If you love all things Google, then the Google Home Mini is for you. Owning a Chromecast is definitely something worth purchasing by the way. Not only does it enable the Home Mini to turn your tv on and off for you (cheesy, I know; mind you, I do not own a smart tv!), it can cast anything from Netflix and Youtube by the usage of your voice. If you're feeling like you're not gaining enough control of the devices, everything you ever need to know is IN YOUR GOOGE HOME settings (both on iOS and Google Play stores). Setup is incredibly easy, and the device itself is lightweight, portable, and affordable. Teaching adults how to use this device is also very simple (trust me, I would know). Lastly, the volume, is quite incredible and very powerful. adjustments to the volume are easy to control as well. The ONE thing I would want the Google Home Mini to accomplish is to play the volume from Chromecast when it's enabled on to my television. Even with it's bluetooth capability, it doesn't, but it does with my AppleTV 4th Gen. So please do keep that in mind. Otherwise, I see a lot of improvements with Google Home Mini in the near future and it's a stellar investment.Less"
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Nifty smart home device.. but,"... you have to understand that smart home speakers are meant to be used with other smart devices. This means that you need to be willing to pay for all new devices, if you don’t already have them. You also must download the Google Home app, and have a modicum of patience to set up each device, but it’s usually very quick. In addition, if you’re creeped out by the thought of a little robot controlled by Google listening to your every conversation, then sending that data back to Google, do NOT buy this item. That’s what it’s meant to do. I gave up worrying because they’ll get the data one way or another, I’m just making it easier. The days of HAL are here, except it’s in my bedroom instead of my spaceship."

First Google has a nicer smart home display that helps control everything. Second was price it was a lot cheaper than amazon’s device and Googles device just looks and works a lot easier imo. No need for a separate control/bridge device to control the lights. They all work with the Google home devices or the app.

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Half the Price and Almost as Good as Google Home,"I've had the original Google Home since it came out and have loved it since we got it. As we've gotten more smart devices in our home I've had more and more reasons to use it, so I was excited to get the Google Home Mini. At the normal $50 price this is a good deal, but at the $30 it's being offered at for the holidays it's a steal. You get every feature of the original Google Home in a smaller size and the speaker sounds really good for it's size. It doesn't beat the original in terms of sound quality, but music is still decent on it and the Google Home voice sounds just as good as it does on the full size speaker. I do have two issues with the Mini. The first is it doesn't have a 3.5mm jack to connect to an external speaker - in order to do that you need to connect it to a Chromecast Audio. This isn't a deal breaker for me since I use it mainly for the assistant functions in a small room, but it's still disappointing. The second issue I have is I find the touch controls on the top of the speaker a lot more difficult to use than those on the Google Home; you have to tap the sides to adjust volume and that tends to move the speaker around. I don't think you can go wrong with this if you're trying to get started on a voice assistant or already have a Google Home and want to add one to another room. There are the minor issues I mentioned above, but it's just too good of a deal for what you get.Less"

It told me I needed a membership to listen to music, which also sounded horrible on the echo. It couldn't respond to 90% of things I asked if. So I decided to try out google mini and wow am I impressed, the sound quality alone is 10 times better on this than the echo dot. Google can actually search the web for answers they don't know. And music seems to be free but I'm not sure since I have a premium membership through YouTube already. If youre in between which to get get googles.

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Getting Better All The Time,"The Google Home Mini is nice but not necessary. It is definitely a luxury item, which negates most of its drawbacks, especially for the price. The volume is impressively loud for such a small speaker, and it sounds decent too. The Google Chromecast Audio, as always, is a great tandem purchase to allow the Home to stream quality audio throughout your house. The voice recognition is very good, although it sometimes does not hear you over the speaker (a testament to the volume). As far as commands, the Mini is not able to answer some of my questions, even simple ones, and it cannot record voice memos. However, it is very handy for cooking, specific questions, and listening to podcasts. If the Home's features interest you, especially the ones I've just listed, the Home Mini is a very cheap gateway into the smart-home ecosystem. The Mini is such a good deal, it makes me wonder what serious benefit there is to spending the extra cash on the full-sized Home. The Home has constantly been updated and improved since launch, and the list of features will only continue to grow over the next few years. There has never been a better time to try out this new technology.Less"

Sadly the BT Wifi is so poor throughout the house it frequently won’t connect. We have had to move it across the room closer to the stairs causing us to shout at the top of our voices to get it to work. Not what you (or your partner) want first thing in the morning. Also because of this feel unable to rely on it as an alarm which is a pity.
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Works reliably and well,I've used this for quite a while and have been quite happy with it. I've had zero problems either in setup or operation; have never had to force a reboot by power cycling (though a few storm power losses have). The sound quality for voice (its primary use) is more than adequate. The music sound quality is good - not great - but I'd never expect great sound from such a tiny speaker. Overall well worth the investment.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Google is the best,Ok so I have like 3 maybe 4 haha so far around the house and I luv them. Like the style and shape and they r loud for being small. They connect to everything like my hue lights and nest cameras and control my Sony smart TVs like if I tell it to play something from Netflix. I’m amazed and I’m buying more. Bought one for my nephews room. Bought it for when he was born and playing calming music or even music would keep him calm now he’s 1 year and he lives it. And his Disney golden books r interactive with google mini. So it plays background music and sound effects when reading the Disney golden books.

If I'm cooking in the kitchen, I just tell Google to set a timer and she does. We set up groups so that the minis all play the same music (or whatever). For instance, Group 1 might be the master bedroom, kitchen and living room, Group 2 are all bedrooms, etc... This way, I can play music in certain rooms while I'm cleaning or if we have dinner guests over or I can set reminders and/or alarms for all the bedrooms :) That's a fun feature! Pay back to the kids when they want to sleep in. LOL! We also have them programmed to our smart lights. So we can control turning the lights on/off one room at a time or all at once.

Said it needed more information and to look at the app. The sound isn’t high quality. I guess it would be useful if you just needed to ask it questions, but isn’t that what the internet is for?"

2.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Limitations hinder it in comparison to Echo Dot,The stand alone music sound quality is better. That is the only plus. Wi-Fi receiver is far weaker at the same place in the house on same network as a Amazon Echo Dot. Drops Wi-Fi a lot. That included info and streaming music. Does not have ablity to hook up to a bigger better speaker without Chromecast. The Dot can hook up to any Bluetooth speaker. takes twice as long to answer questions and the touch control system is not accurate due to the cloth covering the top of the unit on the Google. That colth is likely to be short lived to if you actually control it with touch. Stick with voice commands. I will take the Amazon Echo Dot anyday
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,I nice product for getting into home automation.,I bought the Google Home Mini on Black Friday on sale.

I also have some TP-Link smart plugs for controlling Christmas lights. It’s nice to be able to ask Google to turn the lights off and on. I think the speaker on the Google Home Mini could be a little better as I think the Echo Dot 3rd gen does have better sound quality.

However its perfectly adequate for background listening to music.Of course the real USP is the built in Artificial Intelligence assistant which helps to increase productivity, organises your shopping list (which you can share with your partner), your calendar and you can ask it questions at any time.

While its nice that its small, it's not where near the sound quality of the regular sized google home.

The mini is a good way to add more speakers and stay connected in each room as its small enough to sit on my night stand without taking up too much real estate.

I can now ""broadcast"" that dinner is ready to all the rooms with the speaker. A bonus feature that I recently discovered is the ability to play music throughout the house.

These minis are often bundled with other Nest and Google products and as a result I have 3 of these in rooms that don’t warrant a full display device, even my garage. They’re perfect for that purpose."
4.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Good things can come in small packages,"Bought this as a, toe in the water, tester to see how good and useful these devices are. We were pleasantly surprised at how good the voice recognition was and at the speed of her responses. Most replies almost immediate, much quicker than trying to google it on your tablet. You sometimes have to think about how you phrase your requests but her understanding is pretty good. It will not win any prizes for sound quality but it is good considering its size, which has the advantage of making it unobtrusive. Set up was a doddle. Downside? Price reduced by £20 the week after we bought it other wise it would have been excellent value"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Enjoying the mini as a google assistant,"As a speaker, it is ok, not as great as the google home. but for the price, it is very useful. The google assistant has been of great value. If you use the features that google provides, it is a great tool - an alarm, timer, weather and news report and more. Just the ""Good morning"" and the ""Good night"" feature is worth more than the money you spend. Enjoying every day. Absolutely worth it."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,A great speaker,"Having a smart speaker is one of the best things you can get if you have compatible smart devices in your house. You might not think of it, but being able to say ""Hey Google, turn on the lights"", ""Hey Google, set a timer for 2 minutes"", or a wide variety of other questions like ""Hey Google, how many cups are in 16 tablespoons?"" is an amazing convenience. If you're concerned about privacy, it also has a physical switch to turn off the microphone. The answers to questions might not always be what you want though, if you ask it too complex of a question, many times it will just give you the summary of a Wikipedia article or just say that it can't help you with that yet. For listening to music, this speaker has surprisingly good audio quality considering the size and price."
3.0,a month ago,influenster.com,"In comparison to the other smart home devices on the market, I think the Google Home is lacking. I honestly don't use it very much. When I do use it, I ask it about the weather or to play Spotify. Sometimes I ask it a simple question I think it would be capable of and it's not able to give me an answer. Granted, the Google Home was one of the first smart home devices so I can't be too harsh. In summation, I would opt for one of the newer devices, maybe one with a screen.","In comparison to the other smart home devices on the market, I think the Google Home is lacking.

I have this connected to my Nest, TVs, and garage right now. Not only is there the cool feature of asking questions but I can also ask it to add items to my shopping list and then pull it up on my phone when at the store. I ask the Nest to close my garage door, change the temperature and turn on/off my TVs with the option of turning on specific shows/movies on specific apps (Netflix, HBO Now, etc.)."
5.0,2 years ago,Target,good purchase for me,"I hesitated to invest in the big model and didn't like alexa's forced use of amazon products and autolinking to my amazon account (or the idea of kids being able to voice order something I previously told them no to) so google home was the choice for me. I think the mini is good for anyone looking to dip their toes into virtual assistants, or someone with a small space like an apartment. I got this with chrome and really use the tv voice commands and can't wait for it to expand it list of supported content (ie. supports netflix, but not google). I use the other voice functions as well and have no regrets about my purchase. My only negative is having to pay for google music premium to really unlock all the content. I already use the amazon platform for my music and $10 for just music seems a bit much when I just want to upload and stream music I already own. You can play their stations without paying, but you can't upload you're own music. (One other thing -- people need to also realize that choosing google or alexa will lock you into having to use all their services in order to fully use the virtual assistant. A lot of my friends did not realize this. I picked google because amazon is just too invasive and I hate the amazon fire. Strong feelings towards one or the other (and subscribed services) should really dictate which on you go with.)Less"
4.0,a year ago,lowes.com,It’s a mini with a smart light,This is essentially a google mini with a smart light included. While I like the mini I wouldn’t want it to be my only google home device as it doesn’t provide much of a speaker but it is small and cheap so one would expect that. I have a max which sounds great and use this in another room My friend uses the mini in the bedroom and has the smart light that is included to turn the lights off and on in the lamp. It also plays ambient sounds like running water/fireplace/ forest etc.. you can use the mini as a intercom speaker too if you have another google device. So as a secondary google device it works well and it’s cheap (39$) it is like the other google devices they are easy to set up and work well
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great product...my new best friend,"I started out with an Echo and when it seemed to malfunction constantly, they exchanged it for the new Echo Plus. Not much of an improvement, but I like having voice control of my smart home, Then, I decided to try an Echo dot, (for another floor of my home) which is about the same level as this Google Mini. However, after going through 2 of them, neither of which I could hear (nor could it hear me), I returned them and decided to try Google Mini instead. WOW, what a difference, not just in the sound, but in the quality of response from the device. It almost seems to have a personality...lol, which I think is adorable. But it also is more interactive. It responds better and more often. I do not hear ""I'm not sure about that"", near as often. None of these devices are where they eventually will get to, but between the 2 of these companies, I would definitely say that the Google product is better than Amazon's. And considering Google started two years later creating their product and seem to be better than Amazon already, I am sure this is the product that will win the AI race. The only thing Google still needs is to put a HUB inside one of their products, so you don't need to buy that separately also, like Amazon did with their Echo. If they do that, then I will go completely with the Google products. However, as I need a HUB, I still have my Echo Plus along with my Google Mini. But I do recommend the Google Mini and if you don't have any smart devices that require a HUB, then definitely go with the Google products.Less"

2.0,3 months ago,lowes.com,Great if it worked completely,Set up was good for the hub walked you thru on your phone thru the app. Then when I tried to add the light bulb it could not locate it . I have tried uninstalling it restarting it and changing different locations and still will not find the light bulb. I really wanted this to work as it would work great in our master bedroom since our light switch isn't right when you walk into the room! I will be contacting support to see if I can get any type of resolution for it.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,I Am Very Pleased!,"I recently purchased the Insignia Voice Smart Speaker. I was so impressed with its operation, I purchased another. This was my first experience with any smart speaker. The Google Assistance function is fantastic. I purchased the Google Home Mini to supplement my collection of smart speakers since it can place a phone call. The Insignia Voice cannot place a call at this time. Hopefully, this feature will be added with the next software upgrade. However, I Like the Google Home Mini. It will play music request on the Chromecast Audio Link ( Purchased separately) attached to an external speaker of your choice. I am very pleased with my purchase."
5.0,a year ago,lowes.com,Great addition to the home,"I was looking at getting a new Mini for Christmas. Just as an extra hands-free speaker and information source. Black Friday gave everyone great rates, but Lowe's adding the Smart Bulb really made this a steal. Synching the Bulb to the Mini very simple, as they quickly detected each other. Verbal commands can turn the light off and on, as well as dimming (though it's hard to know percentages off the top of your head). The Home App on your phone makes it easy to dim the light, as well as on/off. This was a huge plus in the winter, when it's dark when I get home. Overall, this is a great package that I am very happy with."
5.0,4 months ago,lowes.com,Very nifty light control,"The google mini alone is high on the cool chart providing access to so much data and response by voice. With just a little set up time the pairing of the light adds a new level of cool. I thought the clapper was cool from years back. Now just say, “Hey Google, lower the lights by half” and boom the level changes. Definitely a neat device and a good step toward a “smart home”."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,OMG I love this thing,"I bought this when it was on sale, around $25, and it's one of the best things I've ever done. I decided to take the plunge when I found out it could control my WeMo network connected light switch. Prior to that, I had to go through a whole process with my cell to turn the switch on and off. Now I just have to say turn off the lights and it's done. The sound is remarkably good for such a small speaker with good volume. It has basically replaced my little bedroom radio. All the controls are voice so I don't have to fumble in the dark for a volume control or alarm off switch. I just love this thing."
1.0,a year ago,Kohl's,Made My Dog Crazy,"Buyer Beware. This product must emit some sore of ultrasonic noise that our dog did not handle well. We began using our google home mini and the dog was fine with us talking to/ being talked to by the device. However, shortly after we started using the device, he began hiding in our house and cowering after 3pm every day. After searching high and low for the issue we finally unplugged the google home and like magic- he was back to himself the next day. We did a trial run of plugging it back in two weeks later and he went right back to hiding that afternoon. The google home mini is officially gone from our house now."
5.0,a year ago,lowes.com,Great starter package,I had a two pack of GE Smart Bulbs that I thought would work with a store branded Google alarm clock. I couldn't get the Google Home app to see the bulbs. I purchased this and placed the mini in the den with the alarm clock in the master bedroom. I added this bulb plus the two I had to the mini and Google Home with no problem. I was up and running in about 3-5 minutes. What was strange is that now the alarm clock work with Google Home and the three bulbs with no issues. I can be just about anywhere in this 1500 sqft house and get one of the two to hear my command. I may have to raise my voice if the tv's on. I'm really happy with the setup and hope to add more bulbs and systems to my home.
5.0,a year ago,Target,So handy to have!,"Okay, this thing is super cool, very easy to set up too. I like that I can set the dimness of the light just by asking Google to go to say 25% or 75%. What I really like is that I can ask Google to turn on and off the light. I placed the bulb next to my husband's side of the bed because he always leaves his side on and forgets to turn it off. This makes turning the light off very easy and I don't have to get out of bed to do it. The Google Home Mini I am still getting used to. So far I check the weather, play music and have an alarm set up for it. All very handy. I need to learn more about the using Netflix with it and my Google Chromecast but I'm sure a quick Google search will help me with lots of tips for this."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Love,"Love this things. Makes life easier. I like in an apartment with barely any light fixtures, so I'm able to turn the lights on before I even enter the room. Love the morning routine feature which you can customize yourself & it tells you the weather, news and even about your commute. It's loud enough to use as a casual speaker, but I also connect it to my Bluetooth JBL if I need a louder sound. It does get tiring to have to say hey google/ok google every two seconds, but it's what you have to do. I'm still discovering the things I can use it for...but definitely more than I expected and I am loving it. Gave a couple as Christmas gifts and they loved it."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Now have the home automation bug,"I needed a new thermostat and my power company had great rebate offers that Nest qualified. The home mini was a freebie that came with each Nest. I had been toying with getting with it and automating my home but had too much conflicting information between Alexa, Google and all the others. I can't be happier with the mini, Everything I have been wanting to connect, is now connected, controlled, scheduled etc. I just wish I had gotten with it sooner. How much do I like it? I purchased and set one up for my Mom (86 years old) It has helped her independent living so much. With me being 3K miles away a huge piece of mind."
5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Get one for Yourself and One for Giving!,"Love it! I already was gifted with one last year and enjoy hearing whatever type music I ask for, getting instant answers to questions on many topics, traffic reports, translations, just by saying Hey, Google! Oh...it even tells clean jokes on command. So at this year's bargain prices, I ordered several, including one for a general gift exchange. I don't need to turn on my computer for an answer to a quick question or detail; can plug it in one particular place or change its position. Know that it must be used in conjunction with WiFi. And perhaps unplug it when you're not using it: Who knows if it's picking up your conversations on the other end!"
5.0,a year ago,lowes.com,Google home mini and smart bulb,"I put this google mini and smartbulb in my bedroom. It was easy to set up with my google home app. In about 5 minutes , i had it up and running. It works great with the google home,that i have in the living room. I use it to play music and set alarms , and turn off the lamp in the bedroom. All i have to say is ,hey google turn on light 1 and it works. I plan on buying another smart bulb,to control the other lamp in the bedroom. Then i can be really lazy and control everything just by my voice. I love all the things the mini will do especially playing my favorite music , and plan on getting another one for the kitchen."

But, when I talked to my friend and she said it's quite useful, then I thought I'll have a go. Now, we are using them for calling kids upstairs for dinner, reminding them homework, checking if they set alarm for tomorrow etc. Potential is endless. I bought two initially, then ended up buying another 4!! No shouting in my household anymore which is fantastic!!"
5.0,9 months ago,Office Depot,Love it!,"I love my Google Home Mini! It's so fun and interactive and I have any info I need at just a voice command. It is also super easy to set alarms and reminders. Initial set up can be a bit tricky depending on what kind of phone or device you are using the app on, but once it's set it is a breeze to use! They are constantly updating and improving it as well. The only thing I wish is that it had a battery life and could be unplugged to make it somewhat portable as a speaker. But overall I love it and would happily buy more!"
4.0,a year ago,Target,Awesome smart light,"Loved it so much ordered a set for a friend toi. I love that I can switch off the bedroom lights without getting out of bed. Also I can turn on the lights when I enter the house with my hands full of packages without having to melons and fumble for the light switch. Would recommend to anyone wanting to make life a little easierAwesome smart light. Someone had mentioned that the app direct you to the GE app to pair the devices and regardless feel too bad the lightbulb with the Google mini. I had the same problem initially when I try to use another Google mini that I already had at home, but as soon as Are used the Google mini which came in the starter kit the problem is fixed"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Keeps getting better over time,"The Google Home devices have become an integral part of my home and family. I started out with the Amazon Echo devices, but replaced them all with the Google Home devices. Now I have Google Home devices in almost every room of our house. We primarily use them to control our home automation and entertainment systems, listen to music, and make calls. The Google Assistant AI is vastly superior to Alexa for answering questions. It's seamless integration with Android and other Google products makes it very easy and productive to manage so many things throughout the busy day whether I'm at home or away."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Surprisingly Responsive!,"I always wanted a google home, and finally got the chance to get the mini on sale. I honestly feel like the mini is the best step forward to see where this device fits in your life. And I can say its the best useful device to be added to my lifestyle. How so? Examples: 1) was hungry and it was late, wanted to know what was currently open and it not only told me the top places, it also included if they were almost closing and how much time left. That little extra info of knowing it was going to close in 15 mins helps a lot whether to rush, or not be tricked to go there thinking it was still open. 2) was busy with my hands, phone away from me, asked my gf what time it was but she was looking for her phone, and I forgot I had google home, and it quickly responded with the time even when Im across the room. 2.5) I can be listening to loud music from it too, and it can still pick up on my voice no matter where I am in the room. 3) I can set actual multiple alarms just by feeding it more specific times I want to wake up since Im a heavy sleeper. 4) asking it funny, weird, and curious questions as I always do on google, and it pretty much always responds with a good answer. 5) asking it the traffic to school and it lets me know if its usual or if there is another route I should take and it goes ahead and explains it. Overall, it feels natural, very responsive, and it surprisingly sounds really good for this small speaker. I can see myself buying more to add to my bathroom or kitchen soon. Would recommend this to start off with!Less"

The speaker has pretty decent sound for being so small, and the bulbs seem decent enough. It's nice to turn on lights when not at home. It would be a nice feature if you can verbally ask the mini google device for directions on how to work it, but always directs to go online for help."

But with built in Wi-Fi connectivity, voice recognition, and home automation support, it controls your compatible smart home equipment from Google, Nest, GE, and other manufacturers. The GE Smart Bulb is one of these and it takes almost no setup. Program your Google Home Mini first, screw the bulb into a lamp, and turn the lamp on. Open the Google app on your smartphone and the bulb will appear. Name the lamp and you're controlling your lamp with your voice - turning it on & off and even dimming it by percent."

It is just awesome for and to us!"
5.0,a year ago,John Lewis,great gadget - useful too..,"Asked for these as xmas presents and have expanded these to three mini speakers and one main hub. As we are at an age when a fall or injury could be catastrophic. the main reason for getting these was as a means of hands free phone contact for help if one of us was on our own. These meet this requirement admirably. We are now learning how to optimise all of the 'spin off' functions, which are many. Can also see a use for this as support for people who live on their own - someone (thing) to interact with. It could help ease loneliness albeit with an artificial intelligence! Great fun!"

Its perfect to listen to music while your working around the house.
3.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Amazon Alexa is Better,"I got this device for free from a promotion related to buying a Nest product. I've had an Alexa device for a year and recently got this Google Home product. To manually adjust the volume on the device you have to tap either the left or right side of the device, you don't get an idea of at what level the current volume is set at so then you have to get it to speak to test the volume. With Amazon Alexa, there is a ring you turn to left or right and a light gets longer or shorter depending on the volume level you set. Alexa wins. I have some WEMO devices in my home. With Alexa you just need to say ""Alexa, find my connected devices"". Then it automatically recognizes them. With the Google Home you need to go into the app, and find the setting for it to recognize new devices. Alexa Wins. if you want to mute these devices so they won't spy on you or listen to what you are saying they have that ability. With the Google Home Mini you have to move a switch on the back and hold the device at the same time or you won't be able to move the switch. With Alexa, you just press a button, that also has a visual indicator letting you know the device has been muted. Google Home mini also has a visual indicator. Alexa Wins. It's easier to say ""Alexa"" than to say ""Hey, Google"" or ""Hi, Google"". Alexa Wins. The accompanying App for Alexa is easier to use and navigate thant the one for Google Home. Alexa Wins.Less"
5.0,a year ago,lowes.com,Nice little smart speaker,"Great sound for such a small speaker. For the price you can’t beat it. Serious audiophiles will appreciate the better sound of the more expensive home max but the average consumer should be pleasantly surprised by the Google minis sound. I love how easy it is to connect smart devices like nest thermostats and GE smart bulbs to Google Home mini. As will all Google smart speakers, installation is a breeze and so is adding smart devices to it. One nice feature of the mini is that it is small enough to tuck away on your kitchen counter and it is virtually out of sight."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Fun & informative,"I got a charcoal color one and loved it so I bought the grey one for my friend & she loves it! In hindsite I kind of wish I got this lighter grey instead of the charcoal, but it’s great. I listen to the news every day & am better informed of events going on & love that you can filter what news you want to hear. Google tells jokes and can be funny. Doesn’t answer everything 100% but it’s ok. Doesn’t link to my iPhone to do special things like send directions to my phone or make calls / text but I’m ok with that. I don’t know that I like the cord always plugged in versus cordless but that’s ok. Sound is good - I linked my Spotify & you can tell google to lower or raise volume if needed."
4.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Not Bad,I have this and an Echo Dot. Had the Echo Dot which is located in a better location and gets more use and already tied in to rest of the house so its a bit unfair. This is a bit more responsive but not enough to swap out for the Echo Dot. ONe thing I like about this is that it ties in to the Roku but I really wish it had more functionality with the TV and Roku where I could get it to swap channels and things. Works well though. I believe my opinion would be a bit different if I got it first.

If you install other smart devices in your home like lights, locks, thermostats or sprinklers, you can control those devices through the speaker as well. It is a great device for lazy people that don't want to get up and flip a switch, lock a door or adjust the thermostat. But it can also be a great assistant to disabled persons that are unable to easily perform those functions."

Whether it is a college grad or my next big holiday. The set up was crazy easy and it integrates easily with other Google products. The GE lights don’t have color variation but they do dim quite beautifully and accent my gray walls. I love that I can just ask Google to dim the lights or turn them so that I can read. It brings a warm and inviting feeling to my family just knowing we can ask Google to help with lights when we are too cold to leave our beds. I’ve already added two other lights to the home and plan on adding more!
1.0,a year ago,ebay.com,"Half baked, and vanishing features...","Worked great at first, then over the course of a few weeks it turned into a love/hate relationship. Biggest issue I have is I can't voice match it; it voiced matched when I first paired it with my phone -- now that I try to reprogram it, the Home app doesn't respond, and the Mini responds as if it doesn't have a clue we're in matching mode. No voice match = having to yell out ""Hey/OK, GOOGLE"" a few times over before the Mini ever responds. That plus vanishing features. One particular feature I really liked was a ""sleep routine"" where I'd be able to set my phone on silent. 1 week later Google roles out an update forcing you to use your phone for that specific routine. Hmm. Disappointing."

After syncing with my Google account, Spotify, Pandora, and Netflix, I am able to play my music library synced from iTunes to Google Play Music as well as access all of the aforementioned services. I haven't synced my Nest thermostats yet, but that's next. I also like that it works seamlessly with Google Voice, and I'm able to make calls for free through the Minis using just my voice. The daily rundown by saying, ""Hi, Google. Tell me about my day"" is also useful as it tells me weather, calendar items, and casts news from various sources that I can listen to while I work in my home office. I'll be continuing to teach it my voice, and expand its functionality as I add services. I'd definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a smart, simple, entry-level helper/home automation system.Less"
5.0,2 years ago,Target,A great addition to Google Assistant,"This speaker has really proven itself indispensable since purchasing. The convenience is undeniable. From controlling my Wemo connected lights, to setting alarms, taking reminders, giving me weather updates, giving me travel times and traffic updates to anywhere I'm going, and so much more. It really takes Google Assistant to the next level. It's worth the price just for how useful a dedicated Google Assistant device is, but on top of that, it's a great little speaker with impressive sound for its size. It works great with Google Music, Spotify, and Pandora. You get big sound from a tiny package. The microphones are very sensitive and responsive, they manage to pick up your voice in just about any environment. The speaker looks nice, too. It's sleek without any visible buttons, that said, the touch sensitive buttons for the volume work well-enough. Everything considered, this is a great device, and after using it for a couple of weeks I wouldn't want to live without it.Less"

3.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Good for remote stuff/Assistant needs work,"I got this on sale at Christmas time when BB was offering a great price plus a gift card rebate. It has been fun to use and works well at controlling my Hue lights, Nest thermostat and TP-Link outlet switch. It also works very well with music services like Google Play and iHeartRadio. It has even surprised me a couple of times in doing things like playing a song from Google Play when you tell it a line of the lyrics. But for other operations and requests, it's really far behind Siri. It's very small size and attractive styling allow it to be placed almost anywhere without standing out as ugly. Keep in mind that this unit is very small. As such, you cannot expect high fidelity from the speaker, but it beats a blank. It was easy to pair with my other mobile devices to use as a speaker. The companion Goggle Home/Google Assistant app are simple for most tasks. But can be a bit confusing when setting up devices like smart bulbs and switches. Overall, I'm happy with this purchase. But I'm really waiting for the HomePod to take its place.Less"

I also linked them all as one ""Speaker Group"" and now music plays throughout the house. I can turn on and turn off speakers by voice command or using the app on my phone. In addition, I can ""Pause"", ""Resume"", ""Increase Sound Level"", ""Decrease Sound Level"" and a host of other simple commands. George Orwell must be rolling in his grave!"

I have always wanted one but the price was never in my price range but for the whole month of December in 2017, the Google Home devices were on sale. Before buying this item, I read a lot of reviews on the original Google Home and the Google Home Mini because I did not want to buy it without other buyers’ opinion on both of the items. I am so glad I read reviews because I would have bought the original Google Home because ‘bigger is better’ but in this case the Google Home Mini would meet my needs. The Google Home Mini is much cheaper than the original and I feel as if the Google Home Mini is much easier to access. It is so much smaller than the original so it is much easier to make space for it throughout your home."

But with built in Wi-Fi connectivity, voice recognition, and home automation support, it controls your compatible smart home equipment from Google, Nest, GE, and other manufacturers. Mini describes its size - not its abilities; but like other Google Home products the Mini's main drawback is that it requires a compatible mobile device running the Google Home app for initial setup - the Home Mini cannot be setup with a Windows or Mac device."

It picks up on commands VERY WELL and does everything it says it does WELL!!! I saw reviews on various sites and YouTube videos talking about the sound when playing music. LET ME TELL YOU, don't be discouraged. The sound is perfectly fine. This is $30 - $50 device so expect GOOD $30 -$50 worth of sound. It won't replace your sound bar, BOSE system, or anything hard and heavy on bass. What it is to me is a bridge between playing music out loud from my cell phone and playing a stereo. It's much louder and sounds more clear than a phone or tablet; you can hear it over the TV; it can fill a room with music but you can't DJ a house full of people with it, lol. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT TO ANY EVERYONE. FYI, my son is 4yrs old and loves using it as well. Currently he keeps up with the days until Christmas, playing Christmas music, his favorite songs, and asking it random questions like ""what do ants eat"", lol.

You will then have the option of adding more smart light bulbs by GE as long as they are within a certain distance from any other GE smart bulb already connected.

The volume can be altered which is great especially if you need it that little bit louder. My only criticism to date is that the information provided is spoken very quickly and I often have to repeat the question.

I had planned on using it at my desk, but didn't really want to have to tell it to raise or lower the volume which I knew you could do. I just prefer a button for this. You actually had to tap on it to change the volume and it could be tricky at times to find the right area on top of it to do this and not to mention how low or high you are setting it because it uses dots to indicate it when to do raise or lower it. I had to research to find out what the buttons on the bottom of it did, so after that I decide to return it. Other than, if that's what you like, I would recommend it. Just wasn't to my liking.Less"

5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Plays well with Samsung SmartThings and Insignia,"Bought three during Black Friday to use throughout the house. Google Home Control does a great job integrating with other devices like Samsung SmartThings and the Insignia Smart Plugs. All you have to do is make sure you've set up your devices on their respective host services (i.e. Samsung Smart Things and Insignia Smart Plugs), then you just add those services as 'devices' to Google Home/Home Control. Once done, devices will be controllable with Google Home Mini. At a minimum, these are nice internet connected speakers. For me, this serves as the means to verbally control some lights/devices and get some background noise/entertainment/info when hands are busy cooking... Sound quality is good (but I had low expectations coming in). But I am expecting Google to continually enhance functionality (please allow hotwords to be customizable - 'hey google' does not roll off the tongue easily - too many syllables).Less"

It connects to most of my home automation devices without interfering with that setup (as all my devices are paired with homekit). This includes Lifx, and iDevices bulbs/switches. It's also nice I can stream music to this easily, but this device is quite small so the sound quality isn't the greatest for music. They can be paired with Chromecast Audio devices to fix this naturally. I've been using airport express devices for streaming sound throughout the home, but I might switch to Google Chromecast Audio devices in the future (there are pros and cons to each so I'm not rushing to make that switch).

Or if you put it in your bathroom, like we do, you can have it play music while you shower or take a nice relaxing bath. Even make phone calls. And because we have it in every room, we can play one song simultaneously throughout the house all at once as a group. Buy it now, and buy many!"
5.0,a year ago,Target,Love this kit!,"I really love the Google Light Starter kit! It was super simple to set up, and the light connected to the google home mini very quickly. I had some Phillips hue lights so I tried to set them up also, but I seem to be missing the hub or something. I am actually planning to purchase some of these kits as gifts because they’re really nice. I received the item for free from Hey, Bullseye in return for an honest, unbiased review. This had no impact on my review. The product and app are easy to install and I highly recommend this. If you’re considering adding some smart lights to your home, this is the way to go."
4.0,2 years ago,Currys,Brian's review of Google Home Mini,"Pros: Very sensitive and pretty good in recognising individual voices. Excellent sound quality and loudness from such a small device. Great in turning TV's on and off, controling volume and playing Youtube vids via Chromecast with voice commands to control and voice commands to request specific videos. Very fast answers to questions calculations and conversions. Looks great (Charcoal one) small footprint and very unobtrusive.Easy to set-up and use. Like it so much I have bought a 2nd one for use in another room. Cons: The top 'tap' buttons have been permanently disabled by Google re the fact that the buttons have proved on some minis to be so sensitive that they self activate and the device uploads all voices heard and records on Google Servers. The fact that they have done this is good for security reasons but is bad for functionality as now always have to say 'OK or Hey Google' to activate rather than be able to press a button to then give a verbal command. Either an area of poor design or poor component quality re the top 'tap' buttons. But for this Google error I would have scored it 10 for overall and design instead of 8.Less"
5.0,a year ago,lowes.com,Fun Product,The Google Home Mini is a good very small speaker system. The sound is good and the volume can be adjusted from very low to very loud and the sound is good at all levels. The volume is controlled by voice only. The device is approx. the size of a bagel but has very rich sound for such a small speaker. The Google assistant is fun to use and can provide almost anything you can ask on the Google search website. The speaker was easy to setup with the Google Home app. Just plug it in to an outlet. It works with most of the music services but not with Amazon Prime. I recommend this device.
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Best starter kit for those leaning towards Google,"Got this item at a discounted price and well worth it. Had it setup in our bedroom first and decided to obtain two more bulbs. No instructions but it’s a pretty simple setup. Note that if you plan on moving the bulbs, be sure to reset them. YouTube videos make it easy for this procedure as the GE website does not help. Works amazing with my google."

5.0,a year ago,Office Depot,Better than Alexa,"I have three in my house and they work perfectly. I use mine as alarm clocks, music players etc. I can also use them to send messages throughout the house like an intercom. If you have a Chromecast or two, things get even better. Google also answers questions way more accurately than Alexa. Unless you use prime music or something. I would recommend this above other smart speakers (except the full size google home. That's probably the only smart speaker that's better than the Google home mini)"
4.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Good speaker on a budget but more to be desired.,"If you like music loud or want to hear it in a different room, this is not for you. After using it for a while, We actually upgraded to a JBL speakers. I have the harmony hub and phillips hue now. If you have a harmony smart remote, this light will not work. But overall, the average person who just wants a speaker and light for easy use, this works fine."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great alternative to Echo,"So I have a house full of Echo devices, but got this free with the purchase of some Tile Mates. I set this up for fun, and so far seemed to be pleased with it. The microphones don't seem to work as well as Alexa (e.g. my voice from family room to where this Home Mini and a Dot live in may not register against the Mini). However, the search results seem to be better - Home Mini directly answers most of my questions whereas Alexa might return ""According to Wikipedia...does this answer your question?"" Also things like getting weather seems more precise on the Mini - returning date and time it might start raining, whereas Alexa just says ""yes, there's a 60% chance of rain."""
4.0,2 years ago,vzw.com,Great Little Device,"Wanted to first say that I would not have purchased this device, except for the price offered. It shipped quickly and was so easy to set up. I would offer one bit of advice, be all in with Google if you purchase this device. It would be useless without other Smart devices (Chromecast, voice activated video monitor, wifi lightbulbs, etc.). This is the first device I would recommend purchasing if you would like to ""dip your foot into the Smarthome pool."" If it doesn't work the way you expect, you are only a small amount of money. Pros Sound quality is great, but don't expect deep bass. Looks much cooler than what Amazon offers - and you can see that Amazon is starting to offer devices with ""mesh/cloth"" covering. Cons It needs a battery back-up No Bluetooth connection No aux outlet Uses Playing trivia games with your family Weather and Traffic updates Telling Smart appliances what to do Please understand that speaking to a device to tell it what to do involves a learning curve for those not used to talking to devices. You will have to Google specific phrases for specific devices in order for this device to work like you want it to, and even then, it's not perfect.Less"
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Made the echo dot look like a joke,"I had bought a Google Home Mini as a entirely experimental gift along with a amazon echo dot just to play around with them and have some fun. I absolutely love the minis smooth round hockey puck design and I barely had to raise my voice for it to hear me over music. It also was compatible with all my existing smart home devices. The sound quality was also so much better than the echo dots so I feel that there is no need to have the mini connected to a external speaker. Also the google home app is much more user friendly than the Alexa app. The Google assistants second voice sounds better and more natural then Alexa's voice. It is also smarter. The only thing I wish the Google Home Mini had is when the four LED's on the top would come on they would be blue, red, green, and yellow like they are when you plug it in and like the full sized Google Home and not white but it doesn't matter that much to me. All in all I think the Google Home is a wonderful device to have and is certainly worth the $50. However the same cannot be said about the echo dot. To me it seems like it is worth $20 and not $50Less"
5.0,5 months ago,Bed Bath & Beyond,Does what it claims,"I couldn't afford the full sized version of this product, so I purchased the mini version. And I'm quite happy with it. Even though you cannot use it to turn lights on, etc., it can answer questions about people, movies, the weather or just about anything. You simply have to remember to ask in short precise sentences just as you would when searching on your desktop or laptop. For the money, this was an excellent purchase for me."
5.0,4 weeks ago,Best Buy,Love my google home mini,"Best technology ive gotten in awhile. Compatible with all of my samsung/android phones amd tablets. Ease of command and voice control, just needs some updates for app connections to connect and cast through chromecast.

5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Buy it!!!,"I absolutely love my google home and mini! I've been wanting to buy one of these babies for a long time, and when it went on sale for $79 during the holidays, I knew I had to get one- plus a few more as gifts lol (the mini was only $29). Since, I've had the google home, I've been obsessed, completely entertained. I ask it random questions, ask it to play music, command it to do certain tasks (such as alarm or to turn on the coffee maker/lights). I also sync certain apps to make my daily tasks easier. I have both the google home and mini; the home definitely provides better surround sound, but the mini isn't bad at all. The mini may be best for a slightly smaller area. Both are extremely sensitive to sound. I can say a command and it can hear me from any room of the house lol. It also responds to voices. So, it's very personal. For example, if I ask, ""Hey Google, add my friend's birthday dinner November 3rd 7 p.m. in my calendar,"" and it'll add it to MY calendar as opposed to if my brother asks it (if he commands google to add an event, then it'll add it to HIS calendar). It does sooo much more. And I'm sure as the years pass, it'll get smarter, more personalized, and overall soo much better. If you're hesitant on getting the google home (or mini), just take my word and buy it. Just dooo ett. I promise you won't regret it.Less"
3.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Not bad but not the best,"I really wanted to love this. I have a regular size Google Home, Amazon Echo, Echo dot and a H/K Invoke as I love trying these things out. I think I put the Home mini at the bottom of the list for all of these. On the top end of things, it is cheap, looks great and has the power of Google behind it. These are all great selling points by themselves, especially if you use lots of Google services such as calendar, play music and more. Now, for the downside of things... it doesn't ""hear"" as well as competitors. I find my self repeating myself a lot more than other units. Audio quality is meh but this is to be expected by a small device... but you can not connect it to a larger speaker system unless it has chromecast functionality. I had my old Echo Dot connected to my stereo via line in and sometimes via bluetooth. The google home does neither. It has bluetooth but it is for streaming to the device, not for streaming to speakers (I have read rumors it will come in a future update). There is no line in to speak of. This kind of makes it useless to me. Overall it is a good device with some issues but if you really like Google I recommend getting a full size Google Home or a difference device.Less"
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,I have minis and the original models - I love em,"I stated with original series and then when minis came out, before they lowers price of originals I bought some of these for my work office, my home office and my bedroom. They do everything the original does. The only thing different that I don’t fancy is that sometimes it not quite as responsive as the originals. But still i plan to buy 3’more of these at their new price point for various locations at home and 1’for my truck. Yup, for my truck. Read the below review I posted about the Systems overall and see just how much value and dependence this tool has brought to our home. ####%%%%%%% I have tried so many things and returned a few companies products i this learning curve. The HUE lights are highly addictive. At first their point seemed too high for my hobby project that my wife would not accept right off the bat. They’ve lowered the prices and a still pumping out great new products. They are very reliable and very customizable. I love them. I love them I love them. See below for another review I placed about the Google Assistant see just how well the lighting has melded into my wife’s Psyche!!!!! =============••= Yes, “them”. At first I bought one and I bought an Echo also. I kept my Google Home Assistant Speaker and returned the Exho. I have bought 2 of the original style and two of the minis for my home. Couple with my smart switches, outlets and bulbs and with both chromecast to 1 tv and the other to anextra monitor and then 2 of the audiocast to two diffferent high output audio speakers in larger rooms and without an Assistant in those particular my house is coming alive. It’s funny, at first my wife kind of put off and frustrated with me doing this. Now she’s fully onboard, so much that other morning after just awakening she hurting the living to fold some cloths she left on the couch the night beforehand. I was still I bed and I heard her say “Turn Living Room” af few moment later I head her say it again. And then I heard her say “Turn everything on” and I could tell by her voice she was frustrated and I could tell by looking the cracked door that no lights were so. So. I said, the ‘mini’ speaker in my bedroom, “Ok Google, Turn Everything On” and voila the living room, dining room, bed room, kitchen, breakfast, many lamps and the Christmas tree all lit up to the preintendes brightness values. I get up an go toward her and say “Whats Up?” I then say, you gotta say Hey Google or Ok Google first. She said well they came on and I told her I heard and and did it for her from the room. She was irritated that her voice sauce was not tuning on the Lights. I have slowly building my system for about 4 months now. During the period she has become so used to the Speakers and talking to command them that she even thought to just go and Flick a switch or button for any light. She’s used to bossing these rooms around I guess. It was truly very cute and funny. BUT the best part is the feedback. ALL the MUSIC from google play. We have a very extensive Apple iTunes Music Library I have compiled from about 4000 CD and then the stuff we purchase through Intunes. I was actually waiting for the new Apple speaker to show up and that why I don’t have one of the larger model Googles. Apple has not delivered I’m just stick to my Google. Any back to the music. Our purchased library is huge. GOOGLE PLAY is exponentially larger and it rocks. I can come home and say Hey Google play some cool Jazz from the 50 and she will begin to fill the room with all kinds of music and artist I would never even think of. I can ask her to Play Contemporay Christian and she’ll plank all out favorites and a bunch of new songs my local radio stations have not let me hear yet. Wi H google play mynacccount in Yourube is upgraded to Red status. That means no stupid you tube ads and I think higher quality definition. She’ll play YouTube to the assistant and Cast devices in audio and replay the contest on my monitors (better that that echo display) and she’ll play my Netflix, news cast and a ton of other stuff on to my chrome cast. In the morning she tell me about the weather, my travel time and my agenda and reads to me the top headlines. We use the one in the kitchen the most. It is usable from Kitchen Living Breakfast ans Dining room areas with how my house it laid out and where I placed it. A great resource she pull up recipes, set times, and does so much. And now, she able to make phone calls too. The call come from my number so my contact know to answer and still I can use her to call MY phone on those occasions it has misplaced itself. My wife, it know her voice from mine and she can do all the above for her preferences. What I really really really want and am waiting in creating calendar events that tie into my Gmail ( and Apple and Outlook) Account’s and the ability to send voice to text messages from her. And real large on my wants to read and create emails. She say something like, “i’m Sorry I can’t help with that yet”. Come on google. Give it to me. My family came for thanksgiving. They fell in love. On Black Friday I bought a bunch of products to get them for Christmas. They’ll be hooked."
3.0,2 years ago,John Lewis,Average,"Overall I found the Google mini a little underwhelming. It does look great, modern and sleek and is also a nice size so won’t take up any room wherever you are using it. It does need to be plugged in which can be a slight inconvenience. It’s relatively easy to set up and isn’t too time consuming, although I did have some trouble syncing it with IOS which I found annoying although that may have just been me. I have had no trouble with it understanding what I was asking and it always answered any questions accurately. It is also compatible with a host of other smart devices although I don’t have any of these so can’t comment on the full functions. I mostly use it when cooking and don’t want to wash my hands, so can just ask the google mini and get an answer very quickly. I was very disappointed however with the sound from the speaker when playing music and felt this could be much better even accounting for its size, so I’ve found myself not really listening to music on it which is a shame as it’s great being able to change stations without having to move! To get the most out of the google mini I think you would need to have smart lighting, heating etc. and if you have these then I would recommend.Less"
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Great as a speaker and as a search enjine!,"I got this little thing as a free item, complementary to the Samsung Chromebook. Loved the concept right away! You can ¨talk to it¨ at home or carry it with you and use as a bluetooth speaker with your phone/tablet/computer anywhere you like. However, you are dependent on an electrical outlet, which is a big minus...But there are lots of bluetooth battery based speakers out there, which won´t tell you what the weather is like today:)"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Easy Access To Information, News, & Music","I like the google home mini because I don't have to fire up my computer to check on: weather, news, specific news to include sport news(which I don't follow), temperature, traffic, sunrise, sunset, spelling of words, business locations, hours, and associated phone numbers, and the list goes on. It is the most capable device for the money I know of. Plus, it will play whatever genre of music you request. It is truly amazing for the money; it is like having a library of resources at your beck and call. In addition, if you say ""hey"" or ""ok"" google call (Now say the 10 digit phone number) google will make the call; at the end of the call you just say ""hey"" or ""ok"" google hang up. You cannot go wrong with this device for this purchase price!"

It was the right call. Everything that I have it is linked and although my cell and my speaker answer individually when I ask 'ok google' I believe it's just a matter of tweaking the settings.

I'm able to verbally control lights, locks, TVs and my thermostats. I also use the GHM for requesting information, checking my calendar, and streaming music throughout my home. Definitely a 21st century home convenience that I really appreciate. The only drawback is that the Google Home app has many layers and takes a while to set up. On more than one occasion I've found myself having to do a Google Search to find out where a particular adjustment is located within the app."
5.0,a year ago,bestbuy.ca,"Great sound, we bought a second one!","It has been wonderful learning all the things Google mini can do for us - quickly ask for a recipe measurement conversion, add items to our shopping list and sharing it, what time the next bus comes, figuring out what to wear by asking for the temperature, how windy it'll be, if it's going to rain and at what time, anything you can ask google without booting up your computer and typing it in. And still so much more... asking for relaxing music or sounds of nature to fall asleep to is our lastest discovery And I appreciate the support from Google... when they added background sounds to transit questions which we found distracting, a quick chat got our comments on for the next release. The device is small, unobtrusive as far as decor, cute actually, and has surprisingly good sound."

5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Personal assistant for $29,"I purchased a few of the Google Home Minis as Christmas gifts but was a bit skeptical due to the ridiculously low price. We already have a full-size Google Home unit and absolutely love it, but didn't think it was possible to pack all of the features into such a small package and for only $29. I was wrong. Setup takes a little bit of time and you'll need to download the Google Home app, but it is very simple. The Google Home Mini is very attractive and looks nice sitting on a sofa table. The sound quality isn't nearly as good as the full size Google Home though. The Google Mini has very good ""ears"" and can hear you from very far away, but this can be an issue if you have more than one Google Home in your house. For example, my son set an alarm on the Google Home in his bedroom and the Google Home in our bedroom set an alarm as well. You'll also hear Google Home echoing through the house when you ask it a question and all of the units provide an answer. I'm currently trying to figure out if there's a way for only the closest unit to respond to commands or questions.Less"

I have only tipped into the full functionality of Google Home, but I love that I can play the same music too both, or different music to each.

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Fantastic little gadget!,"Looks very clean and modern. Sound quality is excellent considering the compact size. Using it as a Bluetooth speaker is not recommended as I notice the Mini dropping connection ever so often. There is also a video-audio synchronization issue, with the sound being noticeably delayed. Google Assistant is very good. They keep on adding new features and it feels very intuitive and fun to use. It can get confused in certain cases quite often though - when there are other people speaking or there are other sounds, the Home Mini can't exactly tell when to stop listening and will most probably get the words all mixed up. I also can't say much about how well it works with an iPhone device since I am using an Android phone. I have finally made a smart home thanks to the Google Home Mini. I am able to adjust the lights or the temperature. I can ask it questions (she still can't answer them all though). I can have it compute or convert currency. I can make sure the house is safe with the smart locks or cameras. I can ask about the weather and the news. I can have it play games with my little cousins. I can check the washing machine with it. I can ask it to make coffee or check on my steak. I can double check if the garage was left open. I can use it as an intercom since I have a couple of them around the house. I can ask it to call someone or to find my phone (will force a ringtone even when phone is on silent AS LONG AS you are using an Android device). It's just a great little gadget, and I couldn't recommend it enough.Less"

Only issue I feel could be improved would be adding equalizer settings for music, and being able to change them the device responds to. Other than that it's actually quite great!"
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Nice Entry Level Smart Speaker,"The Google Home is a nice way to get in the game in terms of smart speakers. It does pretty much what you'd expect- talk to you, answer your questions, control your devices. Sound quality is also good enough for easy listening purposes. There are two main things that bug me about the speaker. One is the fact that you can only say ""Hey Google"" or ""OK Google."" Google's not an easy word to say. Try saying it 3 times fast (clearly enough for the speaker to understand you, of course). I think that you should have another option or two. In contrast, ""Alexa"" is much easier for me to say. The second thing that bugs me is the Google Home app. That thing is a disaster. Options, settings, and features are buried under non-intuitive menus. I hate navigating it because it takes me way too long to find the way to manipulate certain settings. There are also issues with syncing the speaker to my Google calendar and personalized settings that I don't really use anyway, but could be a problem if that's what you want it to do. Like I said, overall it's a solid product as long as you know what to expect. It's a lot of fun, and a really convenient way to turn your lights off at night.Less"
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,New to Home family,"I bought a Google home and 2 minis. Very easy to set up. They work well together, yet don't get confused by which room they are in or which devices they are set up to control. I'd give the devices and set up a 5 star rating. Gave the whole thing a 4 because Google still has a ways to go with standard interfacing and sometimes glitchy behavior (such as having to retrain my voice twice since getting them a couple months ago). You'll hear - I don't understand that or I'm not able to do that yet - quite a bit. But - it's been fun and I enjoy having them to remind me of things to add to my shopping list as soon as I think about it instead of the old way - think, forget, repat cycle), or perform quick look ups for me, or set a timer when my hands are busy, or play some tunes depending on my mood (shortcut phrases are fun) and I like the good morning feature. I'm kind of surprised that Google can't control Nvidia Shield yet (basically Android TV) or use voice commands for YouTube TV - aren't these all part of the same extended family?

5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great addition to the Google Home line,"The Google Mini was a great addition to the Home family. For being as small as it is the speaker is pretty good. I have the Google Home as well and the thing the mini is lacking when playing music is bass. If you are looking for this to be your main music speaker in the room you are putting it in I would definitely consider getting the Google Home instead. However if you already have one of those this is a great extension to expand in to other rooms of your house at a reasonable cost. Also if you have multiple you can use them to broadcast messages throughout your home similar to a intercom. For example you can say ""Hey Google, broadcast It is time for dinner"" It will then play that message on all your Google Home / mini devices. To note the functionality of the Google mini is identical to the Google Home. They both use the same app on your phone and both can process all of the same commands. The major difference is the speaker.Less"

It can do everything the Alexa line can do- such as weather and news reports, reminders and timers, control smart home accessories, answer questions, play music, and more. Like the Echo Dot, the sound quality won’t be amazing, but you shouldn’t expect it to be. It’ll get the job done in smaller rooms though. One thing I enjoy over the Echo line is that Google Mini is much better at answering random questions. And it should be, as it’s powered by... well, Google. Another benefit is that I’ve found Google Home Mini to control the Chromecast quite well. Alexa can control a Fire TV, but the implementation there feels a bit shoehorned and doesn’t always work the way i want. Google’s is more streamlined and can increase the volume or turn off the TV altogether with ease. If you’re a Prime member, go with the Alexa. If you have a Chromecast or will get more use out of question-asking, go with the Google Home Mini.Less"

You can tell the Google Mini to turn the volume up or down using your voice or tapping on the sides of the device. I typically use my voice and have found it a bit finicky on where to tap for volume up/down, I wish there was more clarification on the device. Connecting multiple google home products via the home app is simple! that will allow you to have music playing on multiple speakers at once which is great. One thing that I wish was included with the packaging is Velcro tape. While the footprint is really small, I think it's better suited hanging from underneath a cabinet or side table.

Set up is very easy and simple. Setting scenes, Turing lights on or off and asking questions is a joy. Not to mention that it can make phone calls, set timers and alarms and it even tells you the latest news stories for the day just by saying “Hey Google, good morning”. It can also recognize my voice versus my girlfriends voice so if I said “play my new music play list” it will play the music from my account but if my girlfriend says the same thing it will play from her account.

Almost looks like a pebble. I think it is really good value compared to other similar products out at the moment. Set up was really straightforward from downloading the App and following instructions from there. Set up took around 15 mins from start to finish. Minimal paper instructions showing basic controls was handy to have included in the box. A handy extra is that you can turn the microphone off. The sound quality is a lot better than i though it would be for the size. Volume is good too. Music is clear when played. Google voice is clear and understands voice commands well. The App for it is really easy to use and navigate. The only thing I find slightly annoying with it is that there is sometimes a long pause before it gives feedback after you have given a command making me stop and wonder if it did hear me.Less"

My only complaints are the ways you adjust the volume (picking it up around the sides will mess with the volume) and the fact that it doesn't seem to have a few features that I would think a device like this could handle.

It will play music, if you have a Google play music account and, in short, will only do Google type things. Not all of those things work seamlessly, it seems to have difficulty giving me my appointments from Google calendar.

It is interesting to see the differences in the ecosystems between the two devices. So far though, I am having a lot of fun exploring the mini and all it can do. As far as cons, the speaker gets louder than I expected for its size but it sounds canned when playing music loudly with no real bass to speak of. Also, the music options are more limited than Amazon's offering without paying for a subscription.

I have a Google Home and it largely addresses the sound issue and I was excited to expand my collection with 3 Minis. I also have 4 Chromecast Audios, so I could do some cool stuff. Why am I returning mine? The back breaker for me is that Google disabled the top button, which is functionality that I love on the Google Home. It takes extraordinary arrogance to say we're just going to permanently disable this functionality instead of fixing it. Can you imagine Apple doing it on something so central? No. The other frustration that I'd have dealt with if not for the top button issue is that Google Home apparently has not appreciation for device proximity like the Echos do. So when I ask a question, say, of my phone, if my Home devices hear me one or more of them try to handle the same request. This is most irritating when I ask Google to make a call that I want to handle from my phone and it comes out of the Home instead, with no way to take it back on my handset. Hopefully they'll get there in Gen 3. For now I'll stick to my single Home device and my Dots.Less"

Did not realise you are only able to access a limited selection of songs via device only (in this instance linked to tablet) and unable to ask Google mini to play a particular song (like you can on the adverts) as need Spotify Premium. Really disappointed with this as purchased thinking it would be set up to access music by voice. Spotify Premium is pretty expensive for mum to sign up for on a monthly basis.

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Good & getting better,"Decided to try Google Home to compare with Amazon's Echo. When asking the same question, both do not always have an answer; but Google Home appears to have an answer more often. Each is improving their service and both should be better in the future. Need to investigate what other services each support, i.e. home control devices, etc. Since I have Amazon Prime, the music availability seems more complete with Amazon Echo; although you can subscribe to music services using Google Home. The jury is still out, but initially I believe Google Home may have the edge up due to it using Google search as the primary source for retrieving information. A final conclusion will be influenced by what fetures anyone may use with either of the devices. The test is still a ""work in progress"" and the eventaul release of a similar Apple product may need to be considered. In the mean time Amazon & Google are battling it out at home. Both provide valuable resouces that make things more convenient. Need to spell a word correctly, 'jsut' ask, (neither deals with typos).Less"

Call it an extremely nerdy impulse buy :) The setup was easy as could be and as compared to when I set up my Alexas, the Home is much easier. It only took a minute or so and I didn't have to change the WiFi on my phone which is always nice. My first complaint is ""Ok Google"". Say it out loud. My tongue fumbles over it every time. I don't use it on my Samsung phone for that very reason. The Alexa has a few alert word options - Alexa, Echo, and Computer, all of which are much easier to say. My house is also overflowing with Philips Hue lights, all of which I can control through the various Alexas I've got. I tried setting up home automation with the Home and things sort of ground to a halt. To date I haven't had any luck with it but to be fair it's the pre-holidays so things have been hectic and I haven't really given it any additional time. I'd say that if you're already an Alexa user that the Home may be too late for you. If you're dipping your toes into smart speakers and home automation it's worth a look. Especially if they let you change it from ""Ok Google"" :)Less"

Word of warning: if you already have the google home app on your phone, check that you have all the updates/upgrades before you start! I did not do this and spent almost an hour with tech support trying to work out why the light wouldn't turn off. Once I downloaded the update ... it took less than 5 minutes to have the light working! BTW tech support is very supportive and checked back the next day to see everything was working OK."
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Great entry to home assistants,"Affordable way to get into home assistants. I have both Alexa devices and Google Homes. I preferred Alexa initially but as the Google Home matured I shifted my home over. It’s not as good at Alexa at understanding the difference members of my family but it seems more useful as it has access to Googles library of information and is able to reply with answers, where Alexa would reply with an I don’t know."
5.0,a year ago,lowes.com,Great entry point for home automation,"If you want to try out the Google Assistant this is a good way to start. I use the assistant to check the weather, my commute, and ask questions. I also have used it as a building block of home automation. I use my Google Assistant devices to control lights, thermostats, send video to my TV with Chromecast, etc. One feature I like on google devices compared to competitors is the presence of a physical switch to disable the microphone. If you are having a private conversation and have privacy concerns, you can cut the mic easily."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Mini Minimalism,"Google Home Mini is a versatile miniature rendition of Google Home with a smaller, yet surprisingly good sounding speaker. Similar to it's larger sibling, simply call out ""OK Google"" or ""Hey Google"" and speak your request. The strong suit, not surprising, for this Google assistant, is to address a question that can be answered by Google search engine. That is where it really shines & blows away it's competition. For this reason I recommend owning at least one of these or one of the full sized Google Home, if you prefer. If you already own a competitive virtual assistant, I recommend you buy this Google Home Mini. Owning both one or more Google Home Mini's and a competitive assistant make perfect sense. Each has a specialty and can do specific tasks better than the other. Owning BOTH offers you the best of both worlds. In addition to voice controls (that I prefer), tap the top to pause or resume music playback, and you can tap and hold to activate the Assistant. To adjust the volume, you tap the sides of the device. Or best yet, simply SPEAK your command! I recommend the Google Home Mini!Less"
3.0,a year ago,staples.com,Not as good as Amazon's Echo Dot...yet?,"I have used this now for about two weeks. It streams internet radio and does basics such as weather well. I do not have any smart home devices so maybe it does that well too. However, I needed to find out how many weeks were left in the year and it was not able to answer the question. I asked my Echo Dot and received an immediate answer. It says that it is still learning, but isn't this part of Google? I was assuming that this would be as good as the Echo if not much better. Maybe in time, it will be as good, but for now, it needs to learn more to be as good as Amazon's Echo Dot. If you aren't expecting much give it a shot."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,A great device,"I've never used any personal assistant devices other than Apple's Siri on my iPhone. However, I'm in the middle of expanding home automation for my house, so this little device was a must have. I wasn't interested in too much of voice control (like playing music or asking about the weather), but connectivity with my other devices throughout the house. This little gadget supports my thermostat, some of the smart light bulbs and my favorite thing is the connectivity with my nest hello which is a smart doorbell. I think it will be improved even more over the years as the technology improves as well. Highly recommended."
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Love The Volume Output,Very nifty device. I myself am a fan to AMAZON “Alexa” devices. Fire stick and all that. But to have this google device and have it be capable w/ Alexa is a big game changer. I can control the rest of my house with it. But for me what got me was the volume. It is clear. Not distorted. And very loud. I like and would recommend this device.

However, I need not have worried, as it works perfectly with Google, Spotify and other services. It's such a great looking speaker and the sound quality is much better than I expected. My husband was very pleased with the speaker, however to be honest, I think I get more pleasure from it than he does, but hey ho! Luckily my son visited us over Christmas and explained that apart from listening to music or the radio, all the other benefits of the Google Smart Speaker, such as setting a timer, looking up recipes or requesting weather checks. After listening to music for several hours, I particularly like the idea of requesting peace and quiet, by simply giving the instruction, 'OK Google stop' and hearing complete silence ....bliss! I only wish the same applied when I make the same request to certain members of my family!!!! Thanks John Lewis (and Google) for such a great, reasonably priced product.Less"
5.0,2 years ago,mediamarkt.de,Adding the smart to your smart home,"I managed to grab two of these during the last Black Friday sale and I am quite satisfied with the price to utility ratio. I have hooked up my Philips Hue lights and Homematic IP thermostats and they work really well with home. In terms of language recognition it works extremely well (tried only in English) and does not have an issue in understanding me. Both my wife and I have google accounts, so it recognizes our voices separately and gives us the calendar appointments from our calendars, or the traffic to our workplace. This is a neat feature! In terms of audio quality, do not expect a bose here. But at low or medium volumes the music clarity is very good. I have spotify hooked to it and have never had problems with streaming music. The only issue I see with it is the lack of audio ouput port. So could not connect it to my bose. I had to buy the chromecase audio in order to hook it up to my bose. Even when you want to pass time, you can ask it questions or play some games. Overall extremely happy!Less"

I am using this device as speaker, the sound quality is really not there."

But it is ALWAYS LISTENING, even when you don't think it it, it is. I was talking to my boyfriend about how I wanted to get new pillows, never looked them up or anything. The google home is connected to my phone so I can play music and such. A day later, I got so many ads for pillows on my phone. It's crazy and creepy."
4.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Great device,"The Google home mini is a smart and useful device for day to day information, news, weather forecast etc. It is easy to set up and automatically recognizes your voice.

It’s nice to walk ito a room and just request Google to turn on the light. I we use the Mini Calk for music and alarm outside temperature and early morning news headlines. Sound quality is good for the size of the unit. A great addition to the other Google Homes I have. I will be purchasing other smart lights bulbs and smart accessories.
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Google home is your friend!,I bought four of these little guys to put around the home for my elderly mother. She enjoys streaming music on them and asking for the time and weather. She also uses them to turn on and off the Philips Hue smart-lights that I bought together with these devices. I would recommend the Google Home Mini to anyone looking to find a smart device for a reasonable price.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Excellent kit!,"The C-Life smart bulb integrates perfectly with Google Home & Goole Assistant. Install was absolutely trouble-free - I screwed in the bulb, turned on the light switch, and went to the Google Home app. It was waiting at the top of the screen to set it up. Took me less than 5 minutes from opening up the package to 'talking' to the bulb. Another nice thing is that it 'recovers' quickly if someone hits the light switch instead of going through Google Assistant. If the switch is turned off, when it's turned back on, it takes about 30 seconds to re-sync. And it does it automatically."
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Google's answer to Amazon's Echo Dot,"The Google Mini is in most ways similar to Amazon's Echo Dot. It is intended to anchor you to Google's Ecosystem. It works with the Google Assistant to provide responses to inquiries, and as a hub for such tasks as thermostat and light controls. In my experience, it is faster in responding to inquiries than is Alexa. The speaker is also of better quality than the comparable Echo Dot. Unlike the Echo Dot, however, it lacks the ability to be connected via Blue Tooth to superior speaker systems. If you want to use Google's ecosystem on superior speakers, you will have to purchase the Chromecast, or one of its derivatives. The Google Ecosystem remains somewhat less developed than Amazon's in terms of the availability of third party products through what Amazon calls skills. But if you are happy with Google's own services -- and they are quite numerous -- the Google Mini is an excellent introduction.Less"

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,First time user,"is a little device that’s intended to live in your house or apartment, providing an access point to all of Google’s services whenever you need them, even if your hands are full or you’re not in front of a phone or computer. It can play music, answer questions, tell you the weather, wake you up in the morning, control smart home gadgets, and do other tricks. Everything the Google Home is designed to do can also be done with Amazon’s wildly popular Echo, which launched two years ago. The similarities between the two are near-endless: like Google Home, the Echo is a screenless, connected speaker that’s always listening for a voice command and can play music, answer questions, turn your smart lights on or off, and more. There’s a lot of overlap between these products, and for most intents and purposes, they are all but identical in use. But Home has something that the Echo doesn’t: a wealth of knowledge about the world, my personal preferences, and my habits. In other words, it has Google. I would recommend this to a friendLess"

Its nice for an office because if I'm working as the sun sets, I don't have to get up and flick on the light. Google knows everything. I really like that when she can't give me something, like a song only available with a premium subscription, that she immediately plays another option. Alexa just asks if you want to subscribe. Google is intuitive and quickly ""learned"" my preferences. Excellent product."

Also impressed with the many products that are accessible through the Home mini. Was not sure how much use I would get out of it but it is used on a daily basis by me and my family for various tasks! Very pleased with the added bonus this gives my household to accomplish chores and tasks. The Home Mini is also aesthetically pleasing to the eye and doesn't stick out of place with my household décor. Very user friendly! Great purchase!

Some are providing fun and help to people with serious problems, others serving a range of specific purposes radios, alarm clocks etc. Great company for my 95 year old mother. Amazingly useful for the price. Very adequate sound on the mini. Cons: Volume changes by touching sides making it possible to turn (effectively) off by handling it. Older people may not find the right words to turn the volume back up. Needs a facility to choose your own wake up words."
5.0,a year ago,Office Depot,good smart device,"The Google Home Mini is a wonderful electronic device for everyday users interested in using Google’s voice assistant. initial setup was easy, sound quality was fair, style is cool, durability, and price was acceptable. This low-tech device is perfect for any age group who wants to simply stream music, ask questions, or call friends and family hands free. For first time users, the devices setup is timeless and straightforward allowing anyone to setup, personalize, and use their device in no time.I would recommend this smart device to purchase, good buy."

The Home Mini is cute and easy to fit into any space, and the speakers are still really great despite it's small size. The bulb turns on and off, as well as can be dimmed/brightened etc. It's just a plain white bulb but, again, a good start for him to see what life is like with Smart lights. He's already continued on to get his own color changing lights as well, but the white light will still be useful in the kitchen of bathroom."
4.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,"Good, but Room for Improvement","The Home Mini is convenient for use with Philips Hue and Samsung Smart Things, but I would say it could use improvement on the following: ease of setup of routines, recognizing more voice commands, ease of setup of devices, and faster processing. The second-generation version is quicker, more elegant in its more metered use of verbal feedback, and includes a hook on the back. I would recommend that one."
4.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,Great Voice assistant,"Compared to Alexa, I do like Google’s voice assistant better. They recently released a new, overhauled “Google Home” app for mobile, and it’s very intuitive. The mini controls my smart lighting & allows me to watch something on Netflix without picking up the remote. You don’t realize how convenient it is to say “Google turn out all the lights” until you’re in bed and realize you left some on in the kitchen."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Much better than I had anticipated,"The google home mini is, in my experience, a very handy little device. I originally came to Best Buy only to get a chromecast because I needed a way to stream Netflix and Hulu to my old (and cheap) tv, but I snagged the mini as well when I saw it was on sale for just 30 dollars. I had some Best Buy rewards too so really, it was just an impulse buy. I wanted one and now could afford it, so why not? Novelty as I thought it would be, it has proven me so wrong. I use it to pause and play my tv, I use it to stream my music (and it sounds pretty good for the size), I use it to find out the time when I don’t have my phone on me, and I use it to just play around with. It can’t do some things yet, like stream Hulu to my tv, and if it’s playing anything it has a hard time hearing me, but it makes up for this in how well it recognizes my commands. Siri is awful about not understanding what I am saying, and Alexa is often the same, but google assistant allows me to speak very naturally. I am soon getting two for my grandmother in both her room and the kitchen. The broadcast feature will be very handy.Less"
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Different than the Dot,"Decided to try the Google Home Mini this Christmas when it went on sale. Have been using the Amazon Dot for a while now, mostly for home automation. From a hardware perspective, the Google Mini is a much better speaker than the Dot and can function as a bluetooth speaker for other devices. The Dot can use an external speaker. The Dot has a better (more sensitive, better distance) than the Mini. The bigger difference between the two is in the backend processing. The Mini is much more adept at language processing than the Dot. With the Dot, you select the skills that you want and link them to your device. With Google, it's all hidden, the phone app will search for any compatible devices, which is much more limited than the Alexa skills list. One big issue with the Mini are the permissions that the Google Home app requires, which are much more invasive than the Alexa app. That having been said, the Mini is now a fixture in my office, using it for reminders, music, and as a speakerphone. All of which work pretty well.Less"

Unfortunately Google does not support the calling feature of this device in PR. This was the main reason we bought it so that my dad can make phone calls from bed in case of an emergency. Because of this we had to get him the Echo dot which is not as good as the Google Home Mini but can make phone calls. He liked the Google so much better that he kept both, the Echo Dot for the phone calls and the Google Home Mini for all the other features."

Handy device for catching up with news, weather, setting reninders/alarms and asking random questions. We've also made a couple of calls which, although handy and free, are a little difficult to understand each other and probably wouldn't do for a long or important call.

Cons Reminders don't work, spent a long time with support just to be told ""oh yeah, I just asked around it's not working."" Reminders is the main reason we purchased this device. Local radio station cuts out after about 90 seconds of playing. Many questions will not trigger a simple Google search. Instead it tells you ""I can't help with that yet."" We just were asking for you to search Google, on a Google device. Spotify plays some convoluted stuff when we ask it to play holiday music. Gangster rap and other obscure things we usually listen to make its way to the playlist by the first or second song. Then you get two of the same poorly written Spotify ads advertising Spotify Premium and you understand why it's not providing a good out-of-the-box experience. Since we are a busy office, the time we've invested to get this to work has cost us several times over the cost of this item. We do not recommend. Pros The volume buttons work.Less"

Manually resetting the bulb by turning it on and off in certain ways; that didn't work. Deleting the google home app and re-installing it; no dice. Called GE for support - told me to do everything I already did - told me to contact Google. Disconnect the Google mini and plugged it back in. It finally found the bulb and connected. It's been working fine since. Set up was the only issue."

We use it from daily news, weather, trivia to music, cooking, timer, converting unites, movie reviews etc, Anything you ask it has an answer. Sometimes you have to ask the question in a different way for the device to understand it. Also correct pronunciation is important. If the music volume is high it has a hard time hearing the ""ok google"" . It only recognizes the main users voice. so your sensitive personal is relatively safe. I highly recommend it. It is a part of the house now."

Some of the playlists are also better, but others are definately not. After months of use, I find myself asking Google when Alexa doesn't know.

There is nothing wrong with the speaker as people suggest, its plenty loud enough to be heared across a large room, its meant to be the same amplification as a decent small radio and its big enough to play radio or spotify at a decent level. After reading and watching many tech reviews on the Home Mini its the best buy compared to others, as Google concentrate on developing there products they have, and not like Amazon who keep bringing out more&more gadgets that do the same thing. The Google Home Mini is efficiently more capable at understanding your commands and answering them. And for the price can not be beaten. Also for the price of the Mini you could have 3 or 4 devices compared to one of Amazons Alexa, all communicating with each other around your house. For me the Google Home Mini can't be beaten. Excellent. Google Technology for me is the future.Less"

I then do not have to go into the bedroom at night looking for the switch. I have it sitting on the desk near the second computer that my husband uses. He likes being able to get into bed then tell Google to turn out the light. It works as a safety product so you don't trip on something and to be able to be in bed after watching TV and turn off the light.

This thing is tiny and unobtrusive. With the Google Home app on your phone or tablet you can really dig in to the routines and customize everything. My one gripe is that the volume for a music alarm by default is pretty loud. Even if you put the volume down manually, when you ask Google to set a Spotify alarm to a certain station, it can blast a song at 6:30am at a volume you don't want to be woken up to LOL."
3.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Good smart speaker but not perfect,"Google has several things going for this tiny smart speaker. The sound quality is much better than on the Alexa mini devices however it doesn't have the ability to connect an external speaker via a plug or Bluetooth which is a big detraction. There is also no comparison between the Smart's of Google Assistant versus Alexa's very limited responses and knowledge when it comes to answering questions. However the Alexa assistant, in my opinion, is better at controlling smart home devices. Give Google a little time and they will catch up and probably surpass Amazon. For now if you want a better sounding mini smart speaker that can answer your random questions more accurately stick with the Google mini but if your main concern is controlling your smart home then the Alexa Mini is it better return on your investment. As a side note I own six Alexa Minis and two Google Minis and have put them head-to-head so my assessment is accurate.Less"
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Radio fans should love this!,"I'm a big-time fan of internet radio - and I've got a few Squeezebox Radios in my collection - but as of late, IHeart Radio stations have blocked their streams via Squeezebox - and IHeart streams a substantial number of stations I listen to. I searched for alternatives to the Squeezebox so I could listen to as much as possible that's being streamed out there - they're becoming more difficult to find - and in my search I came across the Amazon Echo Dot and Google Home Mini. They both allowed access to services such as IHeart - TuneIn - Pandora - and more. And at a much more affordable price than any of the alternate internet radios on the market. My Squeezebox has a 6-station memory - while the Home Mini allows pretty much a limitless memory - based on how much my own memory can recall when asking it to 'Hey, Google, play ..... ' Beyond the radio capabilities, the other features it offers to answer questions and all the rest - it's a pretty amazing little item. Sounds quite nice - offers plenty of features - and tunes in a ton of stations - if you want an internet radio that keeps up with the advance of where radio conglomerates are to be found, this is a very sound choice.Less"
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Fun device thats not quite prime time,"I bought 3 Google Mini's, one for each floor, to voice control our lights, thermostat and entertainment. It leaves a lot to be desired on those fronts, being limited which partner companies it will work with. There are also some undocumented ""limitations"" to how it works with those systems. For example, if you have two groups of lights designated on a floor, the Mini (and Google) will not recognize them separately. Similarly with Harmony Remotes. If you have a ""livingroom"" hub and a ""basement"" hub, you can only control one of them with your voice. Seems ridiculous that you can't say ""turn on the livingroom TV"" without sacrificing any control over the basement TV. As far as working with the standard services, it is very responsive and fun for listening to music with the family, or getting a news update, or asking for a joke or to sing happy birthday. For the price, its pretty good. But there's a lot of work to be done before it can do all of the things they claim it will do smoothly.Less"
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,A value for money product with good potential,"Like most people, I bought google home mini during the thanksgiving sale for 30$ and 10$ best buy credit. I am using it for a month now mainly to operate my smart TV. I do believe the product needs improvements but is value for money at 30$ (probably not so much at previous 50$ price). I use amazon echo dot for last 6 months and I find its more evolved than home mini. Pros: 1) Comes with google search engine. Cannot beat that. 2) Smooth integration with the TV using google chrome-cast and other devices. 3) Excellent speaker for the size. Could use more bass. 4) Easy to use all google services including navigation. Which is a big plus over echo dot. Shortcomings: 1) Compared to Amazon echo dot the voice detection is not that efficient. Sometimes you've to actually face the device and speak into the mic. 2) Finding the volume up and down keys is a trial and error. You will find it only if you're lucky. Echo dot has kept it really simple and efficient. Giving 4 stars because I kept comparing it to the amazon echo dot which is 4.5 stars in my opinion.Less"
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,So much to offer on a small scale,"It’s the latest thing - speaking to artificial intelligence to seek a response. Some would say we’ve been doing it for years with friends and family, but electronically, Google, Amazon and shortly, Apple, are bringing the world’s knowledge to your home with a simple command. Google Home is great for those all-important questions like “what time is it in Tokyo?” or “how do I boil an egg”. Speak nicely to him or her (you choose) and they may just respond with a friendly comment to make your day. The mini version is just as good and doesn’t take up as much space as its big brother/sister. Google Home mini can be linked to other Wi-fi gadgets in your home - we control our Wemo switches and Honeywell thermostat with ours - and you can even ask it to play Netflix on your TV via chromecast should you so desire. There is much much more to it, but the lack of a manual means you’re in the dark as to how much it can - and often can’t - do. Like all technology, however, it will improve with age. In the meantime, just sit back and enjoy what Google Home mini can do. “Okay Google, how was my review?!”Less"
4.0,2 years ago,bestbuy.ca,Good lttle speaker,"Here is my detailed review of the Google Home Mini. I am using an android phone so iOS users my experience some difference. Do not currently have any smart home products This is a handy speaker, does the same thing has the normal google home can do, just with smaller speakers. It does not have a 3.5mm audio jack, but you can cast it to speakers with chromecast audio, or connect via Bluetooth. The speaker quality is fairly good in my opinion. I'm using this in an apartment and sound can be heard throughout the whole unit on max volume. I have my Spotify account linked in the google home app, and while some users say It does not work properly that's not 100% true. I can say ""play song x by artist x"" and it will play it, as long as it is on Spotify. I can say play my Spotify library, and it will. Google home is good with directions, but you need to be specific. Like. ""how do I get to (destination) by car. It will tell you how, but will also send the directions to your phone. If you want to know to get somewhere by bus, replace car with ""bus"". Casting with Netflix/YouTube is also a big plus.Less"

After playing around with the Mini here is what I have to share. 1- It does not work with Google G Apps For Business accounts. If you have a G Apps account do not expect your calendar to work, at all. After talking to Google, they say that they are working on fixing this but there is no timeframe on sight. 2- The tactile hidden buttons take some getting used to. Expect to fumble with them until you develop the proper muscle memory to master it. 3- No Audio Output. Unlike the Amazon Eco/Dot, the Mini does not have an audio output that allows you to wire bigger speakers/sound system to stream music through it. This is a super convenient feature. Conclusion, The Mini and by extension the Google Home products are great looking but they just seem like a ""me too"" products trailing behind Amazon's Eco and Dot. Too bad, because they look way better.Less"

And now for some details... Set up was pretty easy on both iPhone and Android (when I switched phones, I wasn't sure if the home app properly migrated from iOS to android so I just did a factory reset). This thing sounds way better than you expect it to! It's not a hi-fi system, but it sounds way better than any small single speaker I've heard. This is set up between the kitchen and living room and it fills the space well enough. Obviously the Google Home Max will sound significantly more full, but this does a good job. The usefulness kind of sneaks up on you. At first it was ""Hey Google, start a timer for 8 minutes."" But instead of asking my wife little questions in which she would search online, I can just go straight to the source and not bother her.

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Excellent bang for the buck,"I had purchased Google Home last year when it came out. I simply couldn't figure out why I needed it since I had my Pixel phone with me all the time anyway. So I returned it. A year later, it's a different story. Google has made some compelling changes. The most important is that GH now recognizes the voices of different family members and provides personal help and music. The second big change is much better support for Home Automation. I have just got into it this month. It's great to be able to turn on lights, control temperature, arm alarm systems using ""Hey Google"". I went for a vacation and was able to control my lights and temperature giving an impression that someone was home. Now all of that can be individually controlled by various apps. But it's just more convenient to do it through GH. I have one main GH and a bunch of minis scattered around the house. Over Black Friday, they were going for $20 a pop. For the size, they have pretty good volume and they work really well. I have only 2 complaints about them. There is no wired aux port. So I had to buy a Google Chromecast Audio. I shouldn't have had to do that. Secondly, there is no way to connect a better quality BT speaker so music can be played on them instead but controlled via the Mini. The latter I hope is something Google can fix via a software update. At $50, I may have bought one mini. At its current price of $30, I'd say, it's a pretty good price especially if you don't have a Google Home.Less"

If you use Android phones that have Google Assistant on them, both devices may respond, which is both amusing and mildly annoying. Perhaps it's possible to tell the Mini to take precedence over your phone, but if it is I haven't figured it out yet. My husband set it up, so I can't say how difficult it was, but it didn't seem to take very long. You have to teach it your voice at first, which he did, but I was surprised when it listened to me, too. (I love how it responds to unexpected commands, such as, ""Hey Google, thank you"". [I always feel like 'she' deserves thanks!]) Things, like setting a timer and changing the thermostat (with Nest), are extremely helpful. Granted, our phones can do this, too, but it's a lot easier to just tell Assistant to take care of it, especially while cooking. We bought two for our home and one as a gift.

I was excited to learn I could create my own shortcuts, until I true to use them. They don't work everytime. Sometimes it takes 5 tries or more. And the other thing is how it brags about having this great microphone and being able to pickup and distinguish background noise and things like that, but when the volume is up more than half way and it's playing music it can't hear you prompting it at all. I have had to pick it up and scream into it and so had to try a few times! Also, I have to say the prompt phrase too many times before it wakes up and hears me. And it's not just my voice because there are 6 (six) of us here and we all have that problem. I don't know if I got a bad unit or if it just needs improvement, but I still give it 5 stars and recommend it because all the cool stuff it does and can do makes it definitely worth having!Less"

When you say ""Hey Google"", it blinks the lights and you have to go near to it to see if Mini is waiting for your command. The lights are on the top surface of Mini.

You can make a phone call with it. If you can't find your phone, and if you've linked it up, you can ask it to find your phone and it recognizes whose voice it is and ring the correct phone.

2.0,a year ago,Target,Not for smart homes,Not enough microphones to hear you (has only two) so have to constantly repeat Hey Google. Smart home commands have a delay which may have something to do with a slow dual-core processor. The smart home part of the software needs HUGE work! Google Home Mini is just a toy. It might be good for other things but definitely not good for smart home commands. The $129 Google Home likely has the same issue since it is essentially the same thing except for the speaker. I returned it for an Echo Dot.

You can add your favorite free or paid music such as the google music or spotify or something else. Even if you don't use any additional settings or apps, it is still very useful. I can ask it to wake me up at a specific time, tell me the weather for today or the week, tell me the latest news, relay a recipe, and a ton of other stuff. It has volume control by simply tapping one side or the other and it will go very loud for music and more. I noticed a negative review about the $25 coupon offering and by the way, I have already spent mine. You won't see the coupon inside the box, it is not a physical coupon. After you have set up your Google Home Mini, it will ask you to add your Walmart info to Google Express. That is how you get the $25 discount. After you enter a yes it will send by email to let you know all you need to do, is go through Google Express to place your Walmart order. It's kind of like a frame of Walmart within Google Express. Very nice layout. You can then shop at Walmart online through Google Express. It applies the $25 to the order. I was like WOW what a DEAL. In essence it was like purchasing this item for $4. If you need help with that, you can contact Google Express and they will help you.Less"

Helpful for many aspects of life, from shopping lists to entertainment. Seems very flexible to adapt to technological and software progression. Cons: Can seem intrustive when it 'wakes up' when not voice activated or starts giving responses without activation. When volume on the speaker is on a high setting the 'stop' command isn't heard over speaker output, requiring manual volume decrease."

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,I prefer over the echo,"I have been playing around with both the google home mini and the Amazon echo dot for a while. about the only thing I preferred the echo over the mini was that the echo picks up you voice better and at greater distance than the mini. probably due to the 7 mic array of the echo vs the 2 of the mini. the google mini wins in many other areas. 1. natural speech. Google has been gathering data points for years, as a result their speech recognition is excellent. you can speak very naturally with the google home, with Alexa you have to be more precise. also, google allows the creations of shortcuts, basically you can assign a short phrase for otherwise lengthy commands. good example is controlling my harmony hub. if you want to turn off you system (pressing off on remote) you would have to say ""hey google, tell harmony to turn off the entertainment system"". with a shortcut, you would just have to say ""hey google, turn off the tv"". in the next release of the google software you will be able to create ""routines"". basically a shortcut that performs multiple commands. example, ""hey google, good night"" and it would turn off the tv and the lights etc... 2. voice identification. this is a good feature if you have kids or are concerned about security. also allows for personalized playlist, calendars etc... I found it too restrictive, about 10% of the time it would not recognize my voice and I would have to repeat several times. 3. automation. I think this would depend on the devices you are using. for me the big 2 were the Nest thermostat and the harmony hub remote. echo will adjust the temp on the Nest, but it seemed to have issues if you were in Heat/cool mode as oppose to either heat or cool. with google it will not only set the temp, you can distinguish which temp, ie. heat/cool mode you can say set the heat to 74 or set the cool to 76, you can also ask what the current setting are, change between heat/cool mode, set to away mode etc.. with the harmony hub, echo could turn off the system, change channels ""sometimes"" and start activities. google, will do all that plus pause, play, channel up or down, volume up or down, mute, unmute.Less"
5.0,a year ago,Target,Great kit!,"I already have a one Google Home Mini in my bedroom which I ended up moving to my kitchen because I discovered the recipe function where it can read it out to you as you go along and I found that really helpful. I used the light in my bedside lamp, and the only trouble I had was initially trying to pair this to my old mini instead of the new one in the box. The old mini would not pick it up at all for some reason, but the new one picked up the light no problem. It just popped up on the screen and whereas I was tearing my hair out trying to get it to work with the old mini. So if you're getting the kit, I recommend doing it with the mini attached and not any other mini you have around the house, at least at first."

Additionally I use it for simple tasks like setting reminders, checking the weather etc and it works great. It has powerful microphones and can listen to me even when I’m 15-20 feet away from the assistant. The sound quality is great for response to tasks but not great if you want to listen to music on it.

I'll probably give it another shot since this was my attempt to make the jump from the other popular home AI, but it's just a lot of trouble I didnt ask for.

Definitely a nice bonus to my Nest purchase."
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Works and is convienient,"My main issues with this product are that the microphone is bad at picking up your voice if there is background noise, even with a song in the background at normal volume you basically have to yell. And that even if you own songs in your google play music library you cant tell your google home to play those songs that you own. It says its only available to be played if you pay for their music subscription service even though you already own the song you are trying to play. I really like this product to use with netflix on my chromecast but you always have to specify that you want it to do something on the chromecast. You cant say ""hey google pause"" you'd need to say ""hey google pause the chromecast"""

A couple of issues, I've got 4 of these in my house and at least once a week they get stuck responding ""An error has occurred"" and I have to unplug them and plug them back in. Also, and this is an issue with google assistant in general I believe, but when you're talking to the device, it will quiet other devices in the same room. This is a nice feature, except when the speaker picks up the most random of sentences from the TV and quiets the TV for a couple seconds."

I was skeptical at fist, but this is one product I fell in love with and I have these scattered all around the home. Even gifted it to my sister and parents. If you are comparing this with echo dot, please don't bother. I used both, but returned the echo. I use this to set reminders, ask for weather, news, set timers for cooking, laundry etc.., broadcast messages to other google home devices. Ask for directions which it helpfully tells me and then sends directions right to my phone. Also works with public transit directions. The sound is decent - I quite like it. I have it connected to nest thermostat - tells temperature, can control it too, but 9/10 doesn't does not tell me what it is SET TO It's not perfect though - Canadian features are far less than US. There are many simple things that it can't do, but the list of abilities will grow for sure. Negatives -...skynet??Less"

It's amazing how fast she is to respond to our questions (even from a long way across the room Mini can catch our voice). My youngest has a speech impairment yet Mini can make out generally everything he is asking. It makes us have a good sense of humor to his impairment sometimes when Mini gets his question a bit misunderstood, innocent little giggles from time to time. On the other hand it helps him to stop then use his speech therapy skills to enunciate better. I think some days that is why he is using it... so he can keep improving. There's very few questions that are unanswerable that we've asked so far. Pretty easy and straightforward to set up. I definitely recommend getting the product. We lucked out and bought it on Black Friday for a great price. Also bought several more for my siblings. I can't wait to find out how their families are enjoying them.

5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Wow,"I was very skeptical at first about these smart home items. Did I really need a speaker that I talk too. But, wow....you need to buy this. Alone the speaker is good. The beauty in this device is when, you start connecting it to other smart devices. I got Phillips hue lights Chromecast(for a older hdtv). I can now control lights around the house. I can turn off my tv with a simple voice command. To truly get the most out of the Google home mini you have to download a app called ifft on the Google play store or the Apple store. It lets customize actions for the Google home to recognize. Oh, and the speaker is always getting better, Google is updating the mini all the time. Honestly, I was not sold on the Google home mini at first. But with a little time invested; it is now integrated in my daily life.

Setting up is very easy also. I am very satisfied with everything.

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Comparable to Amazon Echo,"I got an Echo for Christmas and a free Google Mini shortly after. We use both almost everyday. I have the Echo between the kitchen and family room, but the Mini is in my bedroom. I initially placed it on the dresser below the wall mounted Roku TV. The problem was it couldn't hear me when the TV was on. I had to pause or mute, which defeated the purpose of the Mini controlling my Roku TV. So I moved it to my night stand next to the bed and it works much better. I'm happy with both products but I think the Mini is more low-profile than the Dot and certainly more so than the Echo."

When I try, it thinks I'm asking for a song on Spotify. It also won't play my podcasts from Google podcasts, instead I have to ask it to play a podcast by name, and hope it plays the correct one, normally the most recent one, even if I want to listen to a whole series."

Third party wifi networks are common in apartments, dorms, group homes, retirement communities, and many other semi-group living situations. When I asked for help from the Google Store chat room I was told that ""the Google Home is only marketed to be used in a Home"", as though my apartment is not considered home to me. I was then told that I could use my Google home to ask any other questions I have, however I could not do this because I could not connect to my wifi. I have no idea if I would have liked the product or not, but I was not impressed with this issue or the poor customer service I received. Additionally, this maladaptive issue is not very apparent in marketing or anywhere before you have purchased the device and are actually trying to log in to it. You would think that a company as large and advanced as Google would be able to allow their device to log into a third party wifi, just as Amazon and Roku already are able to do.Less"

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Pretty Nifty,"If you want an assistant at home and have a lot of Google integration in your daily life (Gmail, Hangouts, etc), the Google Home Mini can supplement and make things a bit easier. It's great to be able to verbally tell it to add peanut butter to my shopping list or have it read to me my calendar for the day as I'm preparing breakfast. You can indeed have a semi fluid conversation with it where as the Amazon Echo most of the time requires you to say its wake word. It works great with home automation (smart plugs/switches, smart thermostat, etc). There are a couple of bugs in it though. Sometimes it will just turn on even though nobody remotely said ""Hey Google"" or ""OK Google."" If you turn the volume all the way up and are streaming music to it, it has a tendency to reboot. The device does get fairly warm, so it's a bit of a concern to me since the Echo stays cool to touch. But this is the first generation, so we can only hope it'll get better.Less"

5.0,2 years ago,John Lewis,"‘Small, mighty’ but not completely infallible.","Firstly, I received the Google Home Mini free in exchange for an impartial review. Open the neat box and you are confronted with this fantastic-looking little ‘mushroom’ of a product which would fit harmoniously into any home. Setup was simple and away I went... The Home Mini is activated by a ‘Hey Google...’ followed by your command: play music, ask questions, create a shopping list, save dates to your calendar... Simple. Easy. Right? Not quite. iOS users need to sync their iOS calender to your Gmail account, but pre-existing events on your iOS calendar DO NOT sync to your Gmail calendar, so when you ask your Home Mini about your day it will not list preexhidyibv events. Rather irritating, but not something you can’t overcome! In our kitchen-diner, on countless times my 2 year old toddler has demanded music and I had to paw my phone with food-slimed hands, fruitlessly trying to use a clean knuckle, chin, nose...anything to turn music on. Now? I simply ask Google. Amongst dinner conversation a debate arises. Who’s right? We just ask Google. When I notice we are low on milk... I ask Google to add it to my shopping list. Honestly. Where has this been all my life? My only real annoyance? I wish I had another Google Home Mini and a Chromecast in my lounge, for when I’m feeding my newborn and my 2 year old is demanding a certain program on and the remote is 1 metre away from my reaching grasp, it may as well be in Timbuktu! How many tantrums could this divert then? Truly, I would wholeheartedly recommend the Home Mini and can fully see how it works to support everyone’s everyday needs. Get one now!Less"

My only complaints are: There's no option to change it's voice (I'd rather have a man's voice speaking to me); and a lot of times it doesn't understand what you're asking.

4.0,2 years ago,John Lewis,Best Desk Buddy!!,"For those looking to buy into Google’s smart home ecosystem, the Home Mini is the cheapest way of buying into the Assistant yet. Google's cute Home Mini, is a better standalone voice-activated speaker than the Amazon Echo Dot. That would be great, except for the fact that a lot of Echo Dot owners don't use their Dots alone—they connect them to bigger, better-sounding speakers using the audio-out port, which the Home Mini lacks. Google's demand that its speakers play only with other Google-compatible equipment continues to be the platform's weakest aspect. While it is a good value for the price, it's weak sound performance makes it a better desk buddy than a standalone speaker.

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Better than Amazon's Alexa,"I know it can be a heated topic comparing Amazon's Alexa and the Google Assistant enabled devices. I have had both devices for quite some time now, with that being said after using both devices in various ways I could honestly say that the Google Assistant enabled devices have the technological edge. Google devices are far more intuitive in it's answers to the questions asked. The one edge I will give to the Amazon Alexa is that you can ask it to respond to the wake up word ""Computer"". If you are a Star Trek fan or most Sci-Fi shows you would love this feature."
4.0,2 years ago,Target,Great product,"The Google Home Mini is wonderful and easy to use. Easy to set up, and links seamlessly with your smartphone (even iPhones) via the Google Home app. Google is constantly improving and adding to the Google Home’s impressive list of capabilities. The only complaint I have is a little one, but a feature I was looking forward to using. I have a SmartBulb LED lightbulb controlled by Bluetooth. I can connect the Bulb to my phone and control it that way, however I cannot connect it to my Google Home Mini through Bluetooth or the Google Home app. The brand is not one listed that connects with Google Home. I, however was hoping that I could connect via Bluetooth (my phone is connected to the Mini via Bluetooth) to control the light. Otherwise this is an outstanding product and I would have given it 4.5 stars if that were an option. I would Recommend.Less"
3.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Competitor has better options,The Google Home mini fails to give us the one thing that Alex Echo Dot does give the Consumer. That's the ability to drop in and call home from another location using the Home device sync with my Android phone. G.H.M. is probably smarter than A.E.D. but based off the fact that A.E.D. has that feature. I find it slightly better.

But then I connected them to the bluetooth bulbs for handsfree light control. It's great when coming in the house with hands full of groceries and tell Google to turn on the light. I talk to this thing all of the time now. You can create phrases that string together commands. For example, when I say good morning, Google turns on my light, tells me the weather, the traffic for my commute, and news headlines."

I could probably be a low level geek squad guy. The thing just didn't work as I thought. It is however the best timer I ever had. It might even be worth it just as a timer. If you try this product. Start small and see if it's for you."

1.0,a year ago,lowes.com,Light Bulbs Are Worthless!!!,DO NOT BUY THIS BUNDLE unless you want major stress and aggravation in your life. Got home and hooked it all up and worked fine with voice but under no circumstances would it work with the app. With absolutely NO instructions included and after researching online I found to remove the light from Google Home and reinstall it. NOTHING!!! Did a factory reset on the light 5 times which is a MAJOR pain in the rear end and NOTHING!!! I bought for the Google Mini which I will keep and use but the bundled light bulb went straight to the trashcan!!

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Something to try,I bought this out of curiosity more than anything. That being said the voice recognition works well even with my non-standard accent. It also has several integrations with smart home products like smart plugs etc. I use it to turn off and on the lights in our bedroom. You can also use it to stream music to Chromecast enabled devices. I am streaming music to our chrome cast enabled home theater system. Spotify seems to require premier membership but you can stream google play radio stations for free. It is also better at answering generic questions than Alexa. Overall I would say it is not a necessity yet but I can definitely see it being very useful once I add smart switches to my home.

It did play some good choices for music I asked for, but most of the time it wants money for additional services."
5.0,a year ago,Target,great buy and great deal,"This is a great device. It was pretty easy to connect the google home mini to my phone and set up the light bulb. Its so nice to use in lamps that aren't attached to a wall switch or for when the wall switch is in an inconvenient place. I love that the bulb is dimmable, so if its too bright I can just say ""hey google, dim the light"" and it will! I know there is a ton more that the google home mini can do, like connect to my roku and I'm looking forward to getting that part set up. But, just for sake of reviewing this device and light bulb, it is a great buy."

I like being able to ask it for traffic reports, weather and directions (that it sends to my phone). Voice recognition is always accurate and so far have not had to ask anything twice. The size is perfect as it's easy to place out of the way. I could not get the smart bulb to work no matter what I tried."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Solid Purchase,I got this back around Christmas when the sales were on and it was for $29.99. I honestly wish I would have bought more now that I come to think of it. This speaker is great to use because it can be placed anywhere and it has a solid sounding speaker for the price and when you add in the google assistant it knocks other speakers out of the water. I had an amazon echo dot and this is much better. The assistant is more helpful and it can connect to google assistant on your phone. It can also be used to pair with other google speakers to give you sound in all the rooms of your house that you place one.

I got two Google Home Mini, so I can say it to either one to turn the light on/off. Pretty awesome! Google definitely knows how to set them up easily, simply following the direction in Google Home app. The app finds new device, and then connected. Done. It took more time to get them out of boxes. The only thing is that the GE C-life is 850 lumens, so it’s not bright enough in evening. Night time is fine."

5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Better than Echo Dot,"When comparing the Amazon Echo Dot and the Google Home Mini, I strongly preferred the Google Home Mini. I've owned an Echo Dot and here's why I prefer the Google Home Mini. The speaker on the Mini is way superior to the Echo Dot. Especially at high volumes. When you crank up the volume on the Dot, there is a bit of distortion while with the Mini it's still clear and loud. The Mini is also more aesthetically pleasing than the Dot. The Mini blends in better. The volume controls on the Mini are touch sensitive while the Dot's are physical buttons. I could go on for a while about how the Google Assistant is better than the Amazon Echo's UI but for those of you who are trying to decide between the Mini or the Dot, get the Mini. The design and build quality of the Google Home Mini speak volumes of the amount of work and thought that was put into the product. Definitely worth the $50.Less"
5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,"Small on sound, big on value","While this is the entry point for Google home assistants, the sound output for such a small unit is definitely bearable. It won't be good enough to fill the home, but definitely works for a smaller room. The assistant integrates well with my existing Chromecast and allows apps to be launched on the TV with voice control. It can also be controlled from your smartphone using the Google Home app. If you're looking to test into the home assistant space, this would be an affordable start."

All you have to focus is download the Google Home app and set it up. It takes no more than 5 minutes. We put the light bulb on our lamp on our nightstand. I love how you can power it on and off via voice command. No more getting up to turn/off the light. I'm going to get more smart bulbs to install in other rooms in the house. You even have the option to set them up on the app just label each one. It's a great option for the elderly as well. Super easy and great to have.

I love the ease of access and operation with the starter kit. I will get more bulbs to add to my home."
5.0,a year ago,lowes.com,Unobtrusive and Useful,This has surprisingly good audio for such a small speaker. It's perfect for listening to my favorite public radio station. I even use it for music streaming. It's got a nice rubber bottom to protect any surface you put it on. The best features are the ease of setup and the small size. It doesn't take up any room on my desk. I like that I can turn off the microphone if I want to. There is never any need to unplug it.
5.0,2 years ago,ebay.com,Comparing Google to Alexa,"I purchased Alexa as a Christmas Gift, and thought it was incredible fun. After reading some reviews, I decided to get a Google unit to compare. Alexa is very good at comparability with SmartHome devices, better than Google. The music is Great on both, as you have many options for sourcing your music. Alexa can change the ""wake up"" word to 3 others, but can't change the pitch of the voice (female VS male). Google has a Male voice option but only wakes to ""OK Google"" or ""Hey Google"". This may change in future updates. The audio quality of the Google Mini is slightly better than the Alexa Dot. These are Great for bedrooms. The circle of lights on Alexa are easier to see and understand than Google's 4 lighted dots. I have tried to get them to converse, but it ends after a few words. LOL Both of these systems work well and their future looks Bright as Smart Companions.Less"
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Better than Echo,"I did some serious comparisons between the echo dot and Google mini before ultimately deciding on the Google mini. Google mini uses...well, Google. So it is far more accurate with search responses than Echo. The speaker is also better. While Alexa is somewhat better with home automation, Google mini is quickly catching up in that area. All things considered, I believe Google mini is and will be far better than Echo in the long run. I have two and they are great. My wife talked about me when I first got them and now she uses them all the time!"

Every time I try to play music from my mini it is a struggle. It simply says it is going to play but never does it. It is very frustrating! Some times I have to ask several times until it actually work. I also feel like It never knows how to answer any of my questions. Simple or complex ones. Not even worth the discounted price I got on Black Friday. I would love to get my money back and change to Alexa. Do not buy this product!
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Little but powerful,"My wife and I were looking into getting a smart speaker / home assistant, and were between this one and the other major brand (that rhymes with ""malexa / mamazon""). We decided on this one, and to be honest, it is better than I expected in terms of sound volume and quality for such a small device. Google might still have a way to go with some of the tasks as ""malexa"", but it will only get better and is a good starter speaker / assistant to try it out, get hooked and then need a bigger / better one. These are also insanely cheap, so ok. certainly worth it."

Disable them from the network, and all is right again. This could have had more to do with the Google Home Hub than this particular product, but wasn’t with the time to single it out. Since it was free and I have another option through Alexa, this went back into its box and won’t be used again."

4.0,2 years ago,Currys,James's review of Google Home Mini,"Pros: I bought this gadget for my parents as a Christmas present. They love talking to it and asking random questions. Also it is good for finding out facts, for example we were talking about football and how much certain footballers earn. Where we would usually go onto our phones and search Google we were able to casually say hey Google and engage the gadget during our conversation. My parents are still experimenting with the gadget but they are genuinely happy so far. Cons: When watching TV shows, sometimes the home mini engages on its own. If the program mentions terror for example. We found this a little bit creepy as you feel like someone is listening to everything you are doing. Also my dad has set it up to recognise his voice and it tends to speak to him with an American accent while it speaks to everyone else with a British accent.Less"

I have 2 Echo Dot and was kind of disappointed that it could not go out to the internet and look up answers to my questions. I've done my research on the Home mini and bit the bullet. Got home, set it up and was pretty amazed at how straightforward it is to set up the device. Connect it to your wifi, say ""Ok, Google,"" ""Hey Google"" a few times and bam! All Done. I also connected my Philips Hue device to the Home app. I'm amazed at how well it picks up sounds. Even in a noisy environment. My Echo Dot couldn't even pick up my voice; even in multiple locations. I put the Mini through my test. Asked it a few questions that the Echo couldn't answer and the Mini didn't break a sweat. The mini answered all my questions. Initially, this is what I was looking for. I'll be replacing my existing solution shortly! The speakers on the Google Home MIni is so much better than the Dot. You can actually play some music with better clarity than the Dot. Bass is lacking but it's doable. I'm very surprised. If you want a Home Assistance device, pick this up over the Echo Dot. It's so much better and you can do so much more than the Echo lineup.Less"

If you ask it for news updates you get an actual news report read by a human. My 9 year old keeps asking it to tell jokes which it does and although they are very cheesy is still entertaining. All of this without a ""Sorry I can't help you with that"" or "" I didn't quite get that"" it just works; so far flawlessly.

The reason I can't give this thing 5 stars is that the physical user interface is not as straightforward as the larger device. Changing volume requires tapping on either side of the puck, which if it's not pointed directly straight at you is completely unclear. As well, tapping to dismiss timers and the like doesn't seem to work, so I still have to say ""Hey Google, stop"" when a timer goes off.

And honestly, if there's no other speaker nearby, it's fine for a bit of background music. I think this is the perfect form-factor. If you want a better speaker, get a Sonos One (Google support is supposedly coming next year). It would be nice to have an audio-out jack built in or at least Bluetooth out.

They each have their own entertaining “personalities” but there are also many simple requests which they annoyingly can’t respond to (this is always getting better). Both control my home and entertainment devices nicely. Google is usually a bit faster with this, possibly because most are connected to my Google Wifi. Neither app is great, but they are both useable. Google doesn’t have the same skill options. I prefer the look of the mini over the dot, but I like the new Echo over the full sized Google.

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Google Home at a Great Price,"Bought two of the Google Home Minis for my father with the idea that he would use them as speakerphones, as he's hard of hearing. They work great for that purpose and the speaker sound quality is much better than I would have expected in such a small size. The only problem is that Google Home does not yet allow for the Home service to receive incoming calls, despite the fact that he has a Google Voice account/number. So, one star docked for lack of functionality that should be standard. Bought these for $29 each during Black Friday sale, and also received two $10 Best Buy gift cards. So, net price was $19 each. Used the cards to buy the new, heavily advertised Philips One Blade electric razor, which is a winner. 2 Google Home Minis and One Blade for $60 equals one pretty sweet deal.Less"
3.0,3 weeks ago,Best Buy,Smarter than Alexa,"This is objectively smarter than Alexa, but that doesn't mean it's better. Google is invasive. They want to know everything about you. They buy companies like Nest and Fitbit and then harvest all the data those companies collected on you. There's nothing wrong with this device, but with google behind it I can't recommend it."
3.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Does Not Connect to Bluetooth Speakers,"Sadly, the Google Home Mini will not connect to Bluetooth speakers. I could not believe it either. I went to the Google help forums and verified it. Additionally, there is no headphone output to allow hard-wiring into a speaker system. However, the internal speaker is far superior to the Amazon Echo Dot. So if you don't need to connect to a Bluetooth speaker this is may be the device you want. After listening to the 70's music station on Google Play, I discovered that I am married to the Amazon Music service.I am not about to set up a whole new service with my personal preferences and create playlists. It would be nice to be able to connect with Amazon Music. Again, this will not be an issue for everyone. Would I recommend this device to friend? Yes and no. It is a great product if you are ingrained in the Googlesphere. But if you have Echo devices already you will be disappointed.Less"

I will expand to have it start to control lights via special outlets in the room next. I prefer to keep its use limited at the moment and for it to sit out of the way. I would only recommend this item for people who know exactly what they want to use this for and understand the ways in which it may impinge on privacy."

This is a mini, so the speaker sound is not as strong as a larger device would be, but being able to ask questions and get Google responses is great... much better than echo responses. Also, the Bluetooth connectivity allows you to play your own music from your own device, and my daughter LOVES that! If Google releases the next generation of the home hub with a camera, I will get one of those as well."

I can get whatever mini I want to play music individually as well. Alarms, shopping list, events, reminders, notes, etc., are so easy. No more packing a phone around, carrying paper/pen to make notes, just say Hey Google.... and it does it. Commands are easy. Husband forgets the Hey Google part, but he's getting it. We have most lights on Philips Hue now and man, is that great to wake up and tell lights to turn on and, also off. The TV has an external Chromecast, which works great. It just keeps getting better. I can send text messages too and more updates, mean more capabilities. This is great!

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,A cheap way to get started with Google Assistant,The Mini does pretty much everything that the Google Home does minus expanded bass for playing music. If you're putting these in bedrooms it should suffice. I have basic connectivity with home automation and it's nice to be able to perform actions from a different room. I've had no problem with the Mini hearing me. For some reason when I'm closer to the Google Home the Mini will pick up sometimes. One knock is that it uses Micro USB instead of USB-C. It doesn't bother me that much now since I practically never move it. My frustration is mostly with the Google Assistant. When I try natural queries it doesn't understand what I'm asking. I suspect it'll get better over time. Another minor frustration is tapping the sides to change the volume is awkward. If you use many service in the Google ecosystem get this!Less

It's close, but not there yet. Commands & integrations with other apps are okay, yet lacking. Biggest complaint is having more than one of these within earshot of each other. You WILL have sync issues until the mesh software gets fixed Still fun, though! Decent speaker, useful features, and great aesthetic. I use it every day"

4.0,2 years ago,walmart.com,"Can be fun, but also a bummer!","I won't go into all the functions that other reviewer's have noted. It does all kinds of neat things and is a lot of fun and helpful too. But it does have one poor design feature that can be ""throw it in the trash"" frustrating. It does not have an interior power source such as a small battery or even a capacitor. This means that once you plug it into wall socket and get it all setup, it must remain there in order to remain programmed. If you choose to move it to another location or if the power grid should fail (like it did this freezing morning for less than a second), then the Home mini will lose its setup memory. You have to go through the entire setup procedure again including teaching it to recognize your voice. A real bummer just to save a buck or two on manufacturing cost."

1.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Fairly useless,"Google has disappointed on a grand scale. It can answer the stupidest of questions (where is Santa?) and yet can't dial out number stored in my contacts on my Google account/phone. I can't end a phone call other than saying ""OK Google, Hang up"" - which of course makes it useless as it would record this when leaving a voice message. Also, it does not interface with my phone (like when I ask it to display pictures)...my phone shows it's registered with the Mini but it asks what device to show it on and does not recognize my phone when I direct it to ""show my pictures of ___ on my phone."" It's a gimmicky waste of money far away from being useful unless you're bored, have no friends and need a computer to keep you company. At least I only paid $30...but would NOT recommend this product until they make some serious improvement to capability and functionality. Really disappointed...something I would expect from Apple/Siri, not Google.Less"
5.0,a year ago,lowes.com,Great product,The Mini Chalk and GE Smart Bulb are used in addition to my Google Max. Setup was so easy. I put the mini in my bedroom and it has become my alarm clock in addition to sleep music. Once the app is downloaded for Google adding devices is easy. I added mini and light with no issues. I LOVE the fact that I can tell google to turn the light on and off. I also use the app to turn on the light before I get home.

3.0,2 years ago,lowes.com,Novelty needing assistance,"Pros: Very good speaker, Ask about 'My day' and it will tell time, weather, appointments, traffic and news. Novel fun for kids but soon wears out. Hey Google, 'Spin the wheel' or 'tell me a joke' are silly and fun entertainment. Son actually had help from google assistant while tuning a guitar. Might make a good intercom system if had more than one. Cons: Needs Chromecast to assist with TV and TV smart apps. (not built in). Will play music from a subscription service and will tend to repeat same song list. Many questions are unanswerable. Would like more local news feeds as a choice. National news sites are quite unbalanced in reporting. Overall: Would be much more helpful to have a new home kit that included some basic Tp links, another home mini, Wi-Fi LED light bulbs and such. Next step is to also reduce cost on accessories. For instance some light bulbs begin pricing at $39 for one bulb.Less"

Rather than spring for the more expensive Google Home, I chose the Google Mini. It works perfectly to augment my Google Home. The two of them work in harmony with one another. The only difference berween the two is the physical size. You have the same functionality and usefulness of the larger one at a lower cost."
5.0,2 years ago,John Lewis,Fun to have these now. Will become useful later...,"I now own 1 Google Home and 4 Google Home Minis. The Minis sit in the kitchen and bedrooms... So far they are great for measurement conversions when cooking, checking simple facts for just about anything and getting weather and news updates. The best feature for us is the ability to group the speakers and play whatever type of music playlist you can think of... I'm listening to a Jazz playlist now - all I said was ""hey Google, play some Jazz."" For the price, don't expect amazing sound. The Minis are fine for the bedrooms or kitchen but the regular Google Home in the living room has a much fuller sound and better bass. Overall a great product that will surely get better as the technology advances."

I cannot honestly fault anything about it. Right out of the box, after plugging it in, and downloading the app, it performed perfectly, just about setting itself up. There are many volume levels to satisfy you, from a whisper to loud, whether playing a Christmas song, or telling you how far it is to a friends house, or operate a switch to turn my Christmas Tree lights on or off. How much fun and convenience is that? The value is well beyond the selling price. I think it can be the gift of the year. Leave a note for Santa, or buy yourself one and enjoy!Less"

However, I find that the app interface is not as easy to use. My other complaint is that for a quiet office setting the volume is either a little too high or a little too low.

I wish I would have picked up a few more for our house as they have good great sound quality for the size, but do lack any crispness when turned up too loud. Having a few more throughout the house would allow for more speakers to play at once, without needing to turn the volume so high. However at regular volume they sound great and the microphone on my end sounds great according to people I speak with using the built-in calling feature, which is awesome!

Google on the other hand will give you stores based on how far away they are from you, and even send directions to your phone. You can even ask about how long it will take to get there with current traffic. Alex does have more tie-ins with 3rd party apps, but the main ones I use like harmony remotes, nest thermostat, hue lights, LIFX lights and my smart things hub.

So often the response is, ""Sorry, I am not yet able to do that"" or something along those lines. Even for relatively simple questions. I managed to get it to give me some news updates and NPR top news, but I had to be specific in how I asked for these things. It can tell me the weather as well. I will like the Google Home more when they expand its capabilities some more.

I tried using GE app on smartphone but its disappointing and needs more improvements. With Google home app last update makes it very simple to control lights and devices in an elegant UI."

Set timers, do conversions like ounces to milliliters, set timers and add things to a shopping list all hands free in the kitchen. It's also a Bluetooth speaker to listen to music and podcasts from your phone on. I definitely recommend this product for anyone looking to get into AI speakers at a cheap entry cost."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,We are loving these little guys,We bought a Google Home Hub at Christmas time. Along with it I purchased some of these little guys to go in different rooms. They are great. We also installed some light bulbs and plugs. Now when we go into a room we just say Hey Google and ask it to turn on or off different lights. You can ask it questions and play music. They are fun to have. You can also use them as a intercom system in your house by asking it to broadcast a message. I love them all!!!

I do look forward to getting some additional devices to attach to it like the doorbell, thermostat, light bulbs, etc. I am sure we will get a lot of use out of the system, just wish it had a few more capabilities.","Already had 1 mini, and added 2 more and a Hub.

The thing I love most is my daily briefing because the brain is made to think not remember every detail in one’s life. I haven’t done so yet believe if you have more than one you can use them as intercom’s throughout your own. Even controls my thermostat without me getting up to check. It’s not just for lazy people if you’re disabled and not mobile as you would like to be this one’s for you
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Good companion for the home,"I bought the Google Home Mini for gifts this year because I bought the Google Home for everyone last year. Everyone liked the Google Home so much I thought this was a good expansion of the Google Assistant into other rooms in the house. I bought one for myself to try out and again expand Google Assistant into other parts of the house. It's fantastic. Well constructed. Not cheaply made at all. Works just like the Google Home and so far I'm not dissappointed with the sound quality. I would definitely recommend to others. I would have preferred that Google retained the multi-colored lights on the mini when interacting with someone. It just blinks white, but It doesn't detract from the overall quality of the product."

I highly recommend it!"
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,A great bedroom speaker,"This device replaced the Amazon Echo dot my wife and I had in our bedroom. I like it better for several reasons: - The ability to set and change alarms is easier on the Google interface - Ability to set music as an alarm - Google can call people in my cell phone without any addition (Echo needs an addon) - It's more fun; before going to bed we go on a riddle adventure or a gameshow quiz with Google I've enjoyed this product, and the flexibility it has compared with the Amazon Echo dot. It just feels more like a finished product, while the Echo dot feels like another way to spend money at Amazon. It was always asking me if I wanted to hear about an Amazon service or buy something, which I never did."
5.0,a year ago,Target,Best starter kit ever,"For the price, I admit I didn't have high expectations. I was wrong! Love the app, just paired it directly to Google mini. It paired quickly and was recognized with full functionality natively, The bulb is super responsive - switches off and on quickly with the app .I automated the bulb with an open/close sensor and it is just as responsive to sensor action. I'm very impressed! Compared to Hue (which I also have in my ecosystem) these are superior in every way, for a basic non-tunable dimming bulb."

Our GeekSquad team is amazing to help with the programming but trying to figure out what language and actions to use when paired with the Harmony hub it isn't 100% functional particularly for a handicapped person that needs the voice actions. Otherwise, its very good and compact a great resource for web based information and technology functions for phone calls, wish it had the 911 calling, caller id for placed calls for contacts."

The mini recognise multiple users (and their Spotify account) if each user has their own Google Home account. 4. Broadcast feature is fantastic for families!5. The mics pick up your voice better than the Google Home. 6. Can now be used as a Bluetooth speaker.7. Speaker is small for large rooms but the sound it generates is more than suitable for smaller places like bedrooms and kitchens. 8. The mini works really well with my wifi Yeelights!I now have 4 Google mini's set up around the house and my family uses them every day! Cons: 1. Sounds underwhelming in large spaces (e.g. outdoors, rumpus rooms etc).2. It would be great to have intercom functionality instead of just broadcasting messages.Less"
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great Add-on to Google Home,"This little device does everything the Google Home speaker does... but comes in a small soace savimg design. The only drawback is the sound quality. This device is lacking in bass, but exceeds other devices at this price point. Good for casual listening, but won't impress audiophiles. If rich bass is what you want, spend more money on something that was designed for it. Volume is great and microphone picks up well in a small to medium sized room. You may have to speak up a little louder in larger rooms with a fair amount of ambient noise. As Google Home assistant adds more skills, you will not be disappointed... and at the holiday price oount of $29, why not buy one for every room in the house?"
3.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Good if you only like SIRI (iPhone).,"It appears that the ""Google Home Mini"" is not powerful enough to perform daily task swiftly. It is only as good as the Siri (iPhone) and ""OK Google"" on Samsung phone. When I used it to turn on/off lights, it took between 2 to 4 seconds. The later happened 60+% of the time (slow). This is in comparison to Alexa which was 98% of the time took 1 second to turn on/off the light. My partner got so frustrated entering a room w/o a light and have to wait about 3-4 seconds. I eventually put everything back to manual switch. Since I always carry my iPhone (Siri), my two Google home mini just sit there w/ minimum use. Until perhaps the 3rd generations (or perhaps they have a better algorithm or faster processor), I would not recommend to this product to a friend."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Responsive using Google search data base,"The Google search data base makes this device a good information assistant, however, it sometimes doesn’t know a sports team schedule or TV listings that the Amazon Echo does. It also does not include any local news stations in its programmable briefings like Echo/Alexa does. The speaker is okay for a device this small, but not great. With a subscription to Google Play, you have access to an amazing list of music including some hard-to-find old songs."
5.0,a year ago,Target,Best products ever!,I absolutely love this set! I was so excited to get it and try it out and it certainly didn't disappoint me. It comes with the Google Home Mini and your lightbulb. The Google Home mini automatically detects and configures them so you can control your lightening to your preference. This is perfect for me and I especially enjoy it at night when I have been watching TV and just to relaxed to get up and then off the light. I highly recommend it and it makes a great gift too.
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Great addition to my smart home,Setup wasn't hard. Now I can control all my smart outlets with it.

I highly recommend it if you like to easily control your smart home without using your phone.

Just make sure to say ""thank you"" and ""please"" - it really appreciates it :)"

Home Run!,"So I own the different types of Google, Amazon, Insignia and other Voice Activated Speaker/Assistants and I have to say I enjoy the Google Home Mini the Most. Allowing me access to my Music on Spotify and having the accessibility of Google in such a small, powerful package is one of the nicest features. Compared to the Echo Dot where the speaker faces downward, the Google Home Mini fills the room with music and just sounds better when responding and playing. Having the ability to set it to specific profile and voice commands is the nicest feature so i don't call my girlfriends dad on accident. Some complain about not having a speaker port, but there lies the reason I bought this... to stand alone. Otherwise I would have just bought another product so it's inconsequential."

Aside, from this i love that it has good volume, is very responsive to my voice, and was easy to set up even without having used one before."
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great...with one exception,"I bought a Google Home Mini and was excited to compare it to the Echo Dot. Google Home outperformed the Echo in a couple ways. 1. The sound quality was significantly better. 2. Google Assistant is simply smarter, and produces better information. BUT, the Google Home Mini cannot currently connect to external speakers via bluetooth. This was a deal breaker for me, and it broke my heart to have to return it. Why does this matter? Well, the Google Home is stationary as it plugs into the wall. So, I had it plugged into my bedroom. I frequently connect my Echo to an external speaker and take the speaker into the bathroom as I shower or get ready for the day. It works wonderfully. But Google doesn't let you do this. It was annoying enough for me that I couldn't justify keeping it, as I use it in that scenario so often. So for now I'm back to my Echo Dot - which does connect to my bluetooth speaker.Less"

If you have your work calendar is on outlook and synced to your iPhone calendar, this device won’t be able to access it. It can only access the google calendar. All corporates will not let their employees sync their work calendars to personal calendars for data privacy issues, and rightly so. It does not yet work completely with android TVs. It will play from YouTube on your tv however it will not be able to access your Netflix if you are using an android tv. The voice quality on the phone for the receiver of he call is choppy at times. Not always. Having said that, for th price, it still is a good buy. I think it’s just a matter of time that google figures out the game and makes the updates.Less"

It's cool to be able to go the smart way and manage your lighting as need in any room. Setup is easy quick steps and it's so simple. It comes with the bulb and and you can place additional smart bulbs throughout your house and take control conserve energy and more. Really cool to be smart."

I especially wanted something i could verbally ask a question to and get a decent result, something that lacks on Alexa devices. Before this, I was having to open my phone or computer and go to google to retrieve the info I needed. This solved that issue for me. While many of the features are similar across the board, google home is uniquely different, and worth a shot!"
4.0,2 years ago,Currys,Phil's review of Google Home Mini,"Pros: Very easy to set up and use. The design is modern and elegant. The microphone is very responsive, even when there is a level of background noise.Some reviews said that the Home mini is not really suitable for playing music, but we have found that, at moderate volume, the speaker sounds fine for background music. For louder music, an extension speaker is a must (see bad points). Cons: We found it difficult to remove an unwanted calendar entries. In fact, we are still trying to sort that out!!There isn't a connection for an extension speaker. This seems like a glaring omission by a company that should really know better!!! Perhaps it's Google's way of forcing potential customers into buying one of the more expensive devices!?!?"

4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Works Well,"Got this as part of a package, and I would not have bought it separately. I don't quite see the point of having being able to turn on a light with a voice command when I can flick a switch, but then I don't live in a mansion. The Google Home is a cute toy, but the main thing I use it for is to find out the temperature outside so I know how to dress for work and to change the temp control on the thermostat without getting up out of my chair. And occasionally asking Pandora to play some music. Works well, but really just a toy. Would not buy on its own."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Good enough to get a second one,"This is our second Google Home mini, and that should say nearly enough right there. It was good enough to buy again. It does have its quirks where it just stops streaming pandora out of nowhere, but that’s a minor annoyance more than anything. My wife and I love having knowledge at our beck and call, and Google’s assistant can typically find the answer we are looking for... Also, being able to tell it to add stuff to our grocery list when we realize we are about to run out of something is right up there with our favorite features!"

5.0,2 years ago,John Lewis,Great little speaker,"The actual unit doesn’t feel cheap & has a nice solid feel when holding it. It has an attractive finish & design, it could be said to be simple but I think it looks great. Bare in mind the unit does actually come with quite a large plug, so if you intend to plug it in a tight fitting socket you may struggle! You will need to download the google home app, this is used for installation, connecting to WiFi, etc. It is a good app and is easy to use. To me the speaker is surprisingly good for size of unit and easily fills a large bedroom without sound distortion. Voice recognition is very good, and 9/10 the unit seems to understand what command is given to it. The intergration with google maps is surprisingly useful and gives good travel time estimates."
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,It works well,"While it works well, it is sometimes confusing. I have two of these, one in the living room and one in the bedroom. Sometimes I will give a command in the living room and the reply comes from the bedroom speaker. Sometimes I will ask it to play music while in the bedroom and all of a sudden the sound bar on my television starts playing. Loudly. In the middle of the night. Still, it just teaches me that I need to give further instructions, noting that it should play the music on the bedroom speaker, on the living room speaker or on the sound bar. There does not seem to be any rhyme or reason for why the replies come from different speakers, however. That still does not really affect the usefulness of the device."

5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Google Home Mini vs Amazon Alexa Dot,"The hardware in the Home Mini is very different from the Amazon Dot. The Speaker in the Mini is better than the Dot but you can connect the Dot to another audio device that is a better speaker. The Mini cannot be connected to another speaker device. The Mini has no audio cable output and the Bluetooth will not connect to a Bluetooth speaker (like the Dot will). But the Mini can be used as a Bluetooth Speaker for a device like your cell phone. Completely opposite for these two devices. From a software and functional standpoint, they are very similar. I am still testing to see if there is any special best in one vs the other in software operation. Of course, you can't play Amazon Music Unlimited directly through your Google Home Mini!! Same thing with Amazon Dot, no support of Google services. As far as I can tell for now... Still Testing.Less"

I ask Google for weather updates, how far is a certain store, who invited a certain device, news updates, and release dates for movies. It's a convenient device, I wish the speaker had a little more bass but for the price and what it does I can't complain."
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Charcoal version is more mature presentation!,"Charcoal version is a much more mature presentation. The white one we previously purchased we put in the kitchen because it seems more like a kitchen appliance. The google home mini is a great assistant. It is easy to setup and pair with google chrome cast! It’s great to be able to be cooking and not have to grab the remote, instead ask google to change it to your favorite show on Netflix! The speech recognition and answering of any questions you would normally “google” is also a positive. The only negative is there are not as many smart home applications compatible with google mini compared to Amazon’s Alexa. Make sure to research specific compatibility before buying accessories"

As of today, there are 116 days left, yet Google tells me there are 97 days. Other than that, I have no complaints. Playing games, keeping my shopping list, timer, turning on my lights...it's almost like having a maid in the house with me. So many functions and I'm sure there are many I'm not aware of."

And an Oookaay Google give me 10 more minutes and it sweetly obeys... The sound is surprisingly loud and crisp. The daily brief and weather information is useful. My lightswitch is not in a great place... Seriously considering bying a Bluetooth enabled bulb so it can turn the lights on and off as well. Cons: Annoyed with google that all my music on google play cannot be accessed through the device without paying a monthly subscription. Amazon's Alexa have done the same... The first device that gives free access (like it does on your pc) will win the home hub war me thinks...

5.0,a year ago,Target,handy product!,"we finally got around to setting this up and i love it! we decided to start out using it for out bedroom lights and i'm happy we did this. it is very handy to be able to turn the lights down or off without having to get up (especially after your all cozied up in bed). if you want some music to play or check out the weather, this is a great little device. my daughter was threatening to take it back home with her because she liked it so much. we then went out and bought her one for christmas (shhhh)."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great value for the functionality it provides,"I got one for the kitchen, since that's where our family congregates the most and there's always some question/debate/discussion around the table. Since we don't allow cell phones at the table, we can just ask Google to help us get info. There's even a cool recipe mode which does ingredients one at a time until you ask it for the next step. I can have it play music while my hands are wet doing dishes, skipping songs, changing volume, or telling me what song is playing (Google Music, Spotify, Pandora all work). I can even have it read me the bible out loud through the Youversion app. We even programmed the various voices so it'll recognize when I ask it to add something to my shopping list vs. my wife's. Of course, there are still things it doesn't understand, but it'll only get better.Less"
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Very Smart device.,I have been a user of Amazon since their Echo was released. When I first tried the Google Hub I was very impressed and would have to admit it seemed to be easier to program and use. This purchase was only done because of the Nest products being removed from Echo and now supported by Google. But it was a very good product so I also purchased another.
5.0,a year ago,Target,"Convenient, Useful and Fun, GREAT PRODUCTS","I love these products. The google mini is so useful, we use it to check the weather, set timers and alarms, play music and we paired it with a chromecast to control our TV. The smart light bulb is very nice as well. We put it in our bedroom which makes it very easy to turn on/off and dim the light with just a voice command. I am a huge fan! Also, the set us was very easy, the app does all the work. You can even name your light."
1.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Does not work with #1 Home accessory,"Known Google Glitch for 2 years now will keep this from working with Phillips Hue lights. If you disconnect the Hue lights and try to put to another Google account, it will render them un-connectable in their system. It will even crash the Google Home app every time you reconnect them. (tried on multiple devices) Google couldn't figure it out for an hour with them. Their solution is to use IFTT to make them work. Got an Apple HomePod. It works with Hue lights."
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,A lot of sound for a little speaker,"I got this for the speaker functionality and less for the google assistant. I wanted a small speaker I could plug in and not worry about having to keep it charged. I've had too many little bluetooth speakers that stop charging or pairing after just a few weeks of use. I use it to play music and podcasts for which it has been working very well. It achieves very high volume and clear sound for such a tiny speaker. The google assistant is more of an extra since I don't have an automated home and I basically only ever ask it the weather aside from music requests. I may hook it up to chromecast eventually, but it was worth the sale price for just the speaker functionality."
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,I don't know haw I lived without it,"This is the best invention ever. I am able to get important information anytime from anywhere in my home.

5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Addicting,These things are addicting. Once you experience having a Google Mini you realize how much greater it would be to have one in every room. The kids use it to ask for jokes or how to spell something. My wife and I use it for weather and help in the kitchen. We are able to have them announce to everyone that it's it's time to eat or whatever we would like it to announce.
4.0,2 years ago,John Lewis,Great wee product for your smarter home!,"Unboxing and setting up the Google Home Mini was really simple - following the clear voice prompts and using the associated app. The device is a good size and looks good - less ""technological"" than many others on the market. I connected it to my smart bulbs and power socket and it is great when controlling these - I think these devices really come into their own in this regard. The speaker quality is good for its size, but you wont be using this as a main music source if you want to listen to a lot. Great for quick blasts of the radio in the morning or for setting timers and reminders when in the kitchen. All in all a great wee unit that can help smarten up your home - especially if you want to take the plunge into other smart home items."
5.0,a year ago,Target,Love it,"I love this! Easy set up and easy to use! The speaker is small but has reasonable sound for its size and the mic picks up your voice commands really well. I plan on getting a few more to put in the living room, the extra bedroom, and one for my mother. She isn't that great at new technology however this is very easy to use so I don't see her having any issues. I really like the fact that she will be able to turn her light off in her room so she doesn't have to get up to do it since she is aging and have issues with her knees."

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great Product!,This item works seamlessly with my current smart home items. Connection was a breeze using my Google Home app. I was able to link my phone and TV to the Google Home Mini and was up and running in a matter of minuets. My Vizio smart TV does not have a dedicated app store and the Google Home Mini automatically streams the apps from my phone directly to my TV through the google cast feature. MY girlfriend who thinks we have too many remotes for our electronics uses it to launch Pandora or Netflix with no hassle. Christmas day was great using the Google Home Mini to play trivia games with the whole family as everyone had a blast! My girlfriends mom is now looking for one and the only thing she regrets is not getting one while they were on sale for $30.

Hey Google, what time is it in Ireland? Hey Google, call Natalie. Hey Google, play Steely Dan. I've given up on having a alarm clock radio in my bedroom: Hey Google, wake me at 7. I've got Chromecast on my TVs: Hey Google turn on the TV to Netflix Medici. I bought lots of Google Home compliant modules: Hey Google, turn on the bedroom lights to 5 per cent. I've got the Nest:Hey Google, lower the house temperature by 1 degree. And then there is, Hey Google find my phone. That command alone is worth the Mini's price! Hey Google, Good Night.Less"

We ended up buying 3 of these so my children could have one in their rooms each, as I soon got tired of them coming into my room to ask Google to tell them a home (and it does do that if you didn't already know) If you set up a Google music account it's great for listing to music any song you can think of just ask Google and it will be played. If you buy a Chromecast for your tv (once again these are rather cheap) you can also ask it to play YouTube videos, a film from Netflix and even turn on and off your tv, that was great for me as I always loose my remote. Even thought I already had a smart tv I still needed a Chromecast for this function to work. Also has most over features you can think of, it will tell you the weather, if you ask how long it will take to get somewhere it will tell you. You can even set reminders. Great little product and I highly recommendLess"

It also controls my Hue Philips lights so I can verbally have it dim and change lights without having to unlock my phone every time. The other features I like are having the news read aloud while I get ready, traffic reports about my commute to work, what's on my calendar and more. This is not meant to be a speaker you rely on for playing music (look to the Google Home or the Google Max when it comes out.)

Because it's Google. In my opinion Google screwed up two things. First, inability to connect to external speaker without any additional hardware like Chromecast. We can admit that speakers on both Echo Dot and Google Home Mini suck. And second, inability to change the wake word on Home Mini.

I want to talk to my phone to set an alarm, but it sets it on the home device. Now, I wake up in the bedroom and need to turn off my alarm, I need to go to the living room to turn off on the home device."
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Great for the house!,"This is a must have for owners of smart home devices. I use this for my smart plugs, light switches, alarm clock, intercom, listening to iHeart radio, Nest thermostat, traffic reports, calendar reminders and so much more I’m still discovering. This is perfect for big homes but of course you will need a few more to spread out in your home."

5.0,a year ago,lowes.com,With a Smart Bulb on top !,"So far I don't have any complaint with the Google Home Mini. Better yet, not even the FREE light bulb that came with the kit ( Black Friday deal ;) ) . The light bulbs has worked well on my lights and google assistant has proven to be actually very resilient as me, my wife and kids throw many different questions at her/him. The speak surprisingly is pretty good comparing against smaller or even mid size bluetooth speaker. Wish I had purchase more kits."
4.0,a year ago,lowes.com,compact but powerful,I have a full size google home that I love. this one has the same great functionality in a smaller case. well made quality product. It doesnt have the impressive audio of the full size but still sounds much better than any phone or cheap bluetooth speaker. I put in the guest room so they can play music and also control the lights. For the price it's well worth it as a second or a gift.

I would recommend this little Home Mini Chalk to friends and family if they are looking for something small that has large info and music. Still learning but so far a great product.
4.0,7 months ago,John Lewis,Very good,"Bought as a replacement for an old kitchen radio, it is excellent. Now using some of the other features like adding to the shopping list. Great value as I bought the black version at a very good discount. Only disappointment is not being able to give it a new name and so having to say hi Google to activate."
5.0,a year ago,lowes.com,Mini Chalk + GE Smart Bulb,This is a great way to see how to control another device with the Google system. Once you set up using the app on your tablet or phone you will name the bulb. The entire system will control that bulb from any where. The app is very easy to use and is intuitive. The start card tells you how to get it started. Once you have set up one of these units it is extremely quick to set up the rest of the units. The Chalk unit works just like the standard unit so it is not dedicated to the bulb.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Excellent device with good operation,The Google Home Mini works well. It has excellent microphones that detect questions. The algorithm that provides answers is fast. I bought this as a gift for my parents and they were impressed with its capabilities. The speakers on it are good for such a small device. You can compare this to the Amazon Echo Dot and decide which one is best for you. Both work well.

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Much fun in a small package,"I originally got the Insignia smart speaker and loved the built in assistant as it allowed me to catch up on some news, set my alarm or check on some basic information without having to pick up my phone or turn on a TV. Since I work in the IT field it's nice to not have to look at a screen all the time to do everything. My roommate loves it too and since he likes to cook every now and then he can set a timer without having to stop doing other things. I plan on definitely picking up more google homes in the future when I move."
5.0,2 years ago,Currys,Sarah-Jane's review of Google Home Mini,Pros: I'm really enjoying my Google Home. I have it set up in the office so I can ask questions rather than stop what I'm doing to search - even simple calculations or currency exchanges. I have connected to my Spotify account and so can play music. I also have the Amazon Echo series which seems to get better reviews - I'm not sure why. If I hadn't of read those reviews then I think I would prefer the Google Home - mainly because of the search engine facility where Echo fails miserably on most occasions. I think Google Home isn't quite so strong on the Smart Home front (needing two steps) and as a Smart Home user I guess Echo comes out on top so I'm pleased I have both. It's got great sound and is totally unobtrusive on my desk. Very happy and I got it in the sale as well.

5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Another winner from Google,"I got mine day one. Having already purchased 2 regular Google home assistants and several Chromecast audio units as well as an Amazon Echo dot. The Mini and the Dot are similar devices performing many of the same functions. I have found that the Mini does everything I would expect and a bit more the music quality is far superior to the Dot with the Mini having a much larger range, although the bass is a bit lacking. Interactions with the Mini are more engaging with the Dot voice being rather mundane. The only thing I found to be a disappointment on the Mini is the lack of a 3.5 mm audio adapter to link to a speaker. You can even make the Mini portable by attaching to a power bank."
5.0,2 years ago,Target,Amazing,"This donut size piece of tech is amazing and the packaging was very professional. The speaker blew me away. The Google home mini doesn't have an auxiliary port like the echo dot does, it doesn't need one. The mini will easily fill the entire room with music or the answer to your question. The mini can hear you if you are playing your music at full blast from Spotify, youtube red, or apple music. The mini works great with apple products. It can call people using your phone number with an iPhone and other phones I imagine. I cannot text yet but it is still very amazing. I got it for $29 but now I know what it does, I still would have bought it for $49 and maybe more."

Setting up reminders. Couldn't be happier.

5.0,2 years ago,Target,Awesome lil buddy,"Great purchase, got this for a family member for christmas, they were totally surprised and once they got the little puck going they were loving it. The speaker quality is really great and if you are a chromecast user its the right choice of like purchases to go for as google home connects SO DARN easy to your chromcast or google cast or whatever its called. Using it to control your tv (we dont have a smart tv but all we do it hit on then ask it to play whatever we want on youtube, netflix and so on, it is great). Having google just from your voice it so convenient in the kitchen, setting times, getting conversions, and asking questions.

5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Simply the Best,"First, Google, over all, is better than Alexa. I’ve shot quite of few videos on the subject.

You can’t find a better product."
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Good addition with some minor issues.,"I thought this would be a great addition to my Google Home I got for Christmas last year and has resided in my kitchen. I got this for my bedside with intention of minor music streaming, some podcast listening and an alarm clock. Main issue I have is sound quality really suffers above about the 40% level. Way too tinny and ear drum piercing. Also doesn’t work well as an alarm clock as the top button has been disabled by google due to privacy concerns. So the only way to stop an alarm early in the morning is to say “OK Google, stop alarm” which proved too tough for this device to handle when I was still waking from my stupor. I heard they dialed it in so you can push and hold the volume side of device to deactivate alarms but I have yet to try the update."
4.0,2 years ago,Target,"Google is ""Fresh Meat"" but given time will take out it's elder","More helpful as a robot assistant than Alexa, but Alexa seems faster and easier for ""Internet of Things"" smart home device control. I have Phillips Hue bulbs, Nest E Thermostat, and TP Link Smart Switches in my IOT smart home. It is helpful that Google responds with what particular devices it's activating, as I have ""heater"" in my bedroom, and ""downstairs heater"" in my living room. Never fails, I only say 'heater' and she responds with ""activating heater in bedroom"" whoops... Google wins hands down on assistant items. She knows my schedule and can add calendar items, can help me find my phone, is linked to my Play Music Red account (which has more songs than Prime Music), and has much better search and communication skills."

3.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Not as good as Alexa but there's one redeeming feature,"This product is pretty average. It doesn't have the capabilities of the Amazon devices and does seem quite far behind. The lack of choice of radio actions beyond TuneIn is pretty limiting too. On the plus side, the audio quality of the speaker is significantly better than even the Amazon Echo. So although this unit isn't going to get much use, when it's used for music, it's superior."

Google Home never shuts up, it's ""Okay, turning on the kitchen light for you, here you go!"" Or if she misunderstands you ""Sorry I don't know how to help with that yet, but I'm always learning.""

Generally speaking, they do almost all of the same things, and at current holiday price point of $30 are a great deal. The one aspect of the Google Home Mini that I love compared to the Echo Dot is the vastly superior speaker. That said, I really wish it had an aux out. But since the speaker is much better, that isn't a huge gripe for me. Overall, it's a great personal assistant, and I'd buy it again in a heartbeat."

But as a free add on to another purchase, it's been an excellent value.

Second reason is it's far more aesthetically pleasing that the Dot. It took only a few minutes to set up in the app, was pleased at how quickly it was up running. The voice commands are still in need of some tweaking by Google but I've already paired ours with our Philips Hue lighting and our Sony Bravia TV so we are able to turn on/off all of these using the Home Mini.

5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Good value if you live in Google ecosystem,"Title pretty much sums it up review. If you have Google Play, YouTube Red, etc, then this is excellent for you. I don't have any so I mainly use it for weather, stocks, podcasts, ambient noises, and fart noises to make my nephew laugh. Voice recognition def needs some work. People who sound like me (even females when lowering their voice) were able to activate it. I'm excited to see what else Google adds or refines going forward."

One household was initially apprehensive so I decided to give them the most affordable entry into the ""smart house"" world. I'm delighted to find they've found a use for it, albeit it seems to just be in the kitchen. Oh well. Good introduction to smart speakers."
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Easy to Connect,The Google Home Mini’s have been a great addition to the main hub in my home. It’s us very easy to connect once out of the box. Since we live in a 3 level home it allows us to easily broadcast messages to all the rooms when’s its time for dinner or morning time. Superful for other small commands.
4.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Great Easy to Use,It is as simple as in the commercial to use this device. It is something I use every day and makes some of the hardest thing easier.

Find out simple and fast answers to my questions without haggling and shuffling to find my phone if I do not have it on me.

With Alexa it’s very hit and miss. This gets it right first time, everytime. The sound quality for the price is fantastic. It’s crisp and clear. There’s so much it can do and I highly recommend it. Infact i’m going to buy another couple of them for other places throughout the house as it is so useful."

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Google Mini vs Amazon Dot,"Hands down the Google Mini is superior. It will search the web to find you an answer to a question. Alexa doesn't. I wanted to know how much it cost to ride a cable car in San Francisco. Alexa was stumped. The Google Mini searched the web and gave me a very complete answer and even told me the hours the cable cars operated.The Google Mini calls me by my name and works seamlessly with my Samsung Galaxy Note. I have to say that I am quite impressed by the well rounded usefulness of the Google Mini. Poor Alexa will play our Amazon Music because its tied to it, but little more than that now that Google Mini is here. If I were to compare speakers I'd say they sound about the same. The larger Echo by Amazon does sound better than the Google Mini, but that's not a fair comparison."
3.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Does not do translation well,I bought this and an Echo dot to see if either one was easy to use for conversational language translation. Neither smart speaker did as good a job as using Google Translate on a smart phone. The way you needed to phrase your commands was awkward and time consuming compared to using a smartphone. I am not interested in home automation so that part of the device was not tested. I think Google Home did a better job at answering my questions than the Echo dot. Once in awhile the Echo would give the better answer. I will need to play with both some more and explore their other capabilities before I can make a final determination as to their usefulness.

I was so pleased that now I have 3 Google Home devices , 2 of them google minis. Silly but I ask for the time, date and temperature several times a day. It's just easy.

Still, no big deal. I love mine,"

This on the other hand takes one gmail account and ability to yes to a couple of permissions and your done. Google answers real life question w/o the hassle of trying to figure out how to phrase the question to get the answer you want. I links to everything right from the start. Until these came out I had left a couple of phones on in various rooms to get the same effect. These just are better to look at and only answer when asked. Cortana is just starting to catch up and it will take a long time. Google assistand will soon be an ear bud that will live with us 24/7Less"

The gift one will be the only one not returned (maybe) but the other two were returned today (Dec 26, 2017, less than one day of use). I replaced them with Amazon Echo Dots which I know will connect to bluetooth (or by 3.5mm) without having to buy additional junk as the Google Home Mini requires AND for the same price as the Minis. To top it off it requires two apps to manage one's smart home and it has no options for Scenes or Groups. Typical Google. Selling beta imitations. Thank you, Google, for pointing me in the right direction."

I find that Google has a more sophisticated search capability (being Google) and can answer my questions with more accuracy and relevancy. I love/hate that it already has all of my google data and knows that I have a package scheduled for the next day (it can read my gmail) and a flight in 2 weeks. It's a little scary, but is helpful for me to ask more specific questions. I do kind of wish I had gotten the one with the better speaker, but maybe I'll upgrade in the future!"

If you are set up with Google you will love it, we returned it due to convenience for the Echo’s. I did prefer the sound on the Google mini to the echo, but the #1 decider was the functionality of the broadcast functions/intercom. Google Maps no only works by broadcasting to every unit (we have 6 for use as an intercom) which Was annoying, and you had to broadcast a new message from each side of the conversation as a new broadcast (slow and annoying). The Echo however, you can drop in from another Echo or cell phone remotely and the feature works like a phone on speaker phone, Awesome! Cheaper and nicer than a whole house intercom system!Less"

Works very well in setting up alarm for random days (Echo is not as flexible). Cons: Does not support Bluetooth speaker.

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Follows conversations better than Alexa,The Google Home Mini follows conversation better than my Amazon Echo Alexa. We have had the Amazon Alexa in our house for over two years. It does not always understands what you are saying and you have to repeat yourself on several time but the Google Home Mini understands my question or commands. I haven’t had to repeat myself with Mini I now ask my questions from my Google Home Mini instead of my Amazon Alexa.

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Good for an initial version. Anticipating Updates.,"Let me be honest here, I picked this over the Echo since it was $10 cheaper last Friday and I trusted the future potential Google has, to become the best in the market here. First, it's an excellent speaker. For the $20 I paid effectively, this alone is good enough a reason to buy. My most common use cases for me are for the timer, calendar, and weather. The biggest disappointment is that you need a Youtube Red or Spotify premium for play music from the respective platforms. This, unfortunately, wasn't conveyed in the other reviews. I'm not a smarthome enthusiast and don't use those features yet. Looking forward to more and better integrations."

But I like the way I can connect it to other devices! I think I will enjoy it as we get to know each other better! (Yep, I know I am being anthropomorphic! But, hey...I've never had a device that speaks to me, plays music I want to hear, etc.!!!"

We have both C by GE Smart lights as well as Philips Hue smart bulbs. If you add additional Hue lights to your existing system, you may have difficulties getting your Google Hub or Minis to recognize them, Simply un-link and re-link Philips Hue and you'll be up and running with the new light additions."
5.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Very clever little gadget,We decided to try these Google mini while they were on sale. Very easy to setup and you can ask any question and play music( subscription required). Sound quality is OK for the price but ended up buying LG speaker to put in the kitchen. Now have bought 2 more for the kids bedrooms. Voice recognition is very good compare to my LG speaker with built in voice recognition as well as Alexa (My dad has Alexa). Its worth every penny!
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Genius!,"Even if you don't have a smart home I would recommend this product. For the price, it's simply a great speaker to have in your house for music. The sound quality exceeded my expectations playing Spotify. Sounds much better than the Echo Dot. It's also nice to get weather or traffic updates before we head out of the house. It also makes it easy to set reminders and alarms. Great, easy to use, product!"
5.0,a year ago,Target,Sound of music,"I have 7 minis, 1 home and 1 hub. I love them and have them through the house. I play my music everyday and I get that complete flood of sound that I love to hear. I love to be able to broadcast to the house when no one wants to answer the phone. It may not do everything Alexa can, but I love google better for me. It’s just want I need and no more. Now to add a little base to complete my sound and be able to conectit as surround sound with the TV and I will be in heaven."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Lights are great...Google Assist-what??,"The only response I get out of the Google assistant is: ""Sure. Let me get some more information so I can help you with that."" It knows the weather but do not ask it for anything else! I would not recommend this do-hickey. Actually love the light bulbs. It is easy to turn on/off or dim a room full of lamps situated at various locations with the touch of a button from the iPhone!! I would recommend the bulbs."
5.0,10 months ago,Best Buy,This is the best!,This was my first real purchase towards making my house more smart. I wasn’t sure if I would like the google home but I ended up loving it.

5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Big help,I bought this and smart bulbs for my daughter who is a Hospice nurse and has to sometimes go out in the middle of the night. The mini and the bulbs are a god send as she can turn the lice on from her car and not have to come back to a dark house. Thank you so much for such a great product. The mini also does many things for her and keeps her company.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,It's great if you use it,"This thing is like having your own personal assistant. You can ask it just about anything and it knows how to Answer. It even has fun games and trivia that you can play with family and friends. It's kind of weird though if left on, it just kind of sits there listening to all your conversations while learning about you lol. So don't be surprised if you ask it something in the presence of someone else and you get busted for something you said in a private conversation... ijs"

His little brother loves the mini speaker and every command he directs to Google. The good part is that the speaker recognizes not only his voice but everyone in the family. You can set it up to tell you the weather for the next day, for alarm and money other things. I will recommend the product anytime."
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,"Works as Advertised, But Won't Blow You Away","I ordered my Google Home Mini on Black Friday and while I've had fun with it, it has its limitations. It does everything Google says it can: play music from streaming services, hands-free calls, give you your morning news brief, answer random questions, etc. However, it often feels more like a hands-free Google engine than a true AI assistant. It can answer some emotion-based questions such as ""Hey Google, help me relax"" (proceeds to play soothing music) but not others (""Hey Google, do you have any dating advice?""). Also keep in mind that it needs to stay plugged in to work. Overall, I really like this, especially for the price. I'm just looking forward to more updates and AI improvements (and eventually a wireless model)."
5.0,a year ago,Office Depot,Loving my Google Mini,"I actually had a coupon for a free Google Home Mini Speaker with a $200 purchase. I figured why not, let's see how this thing works. When I received it I didn't think it would be that great because it is so small. Set up was super easy and once I had it up and running it is so easy to use! The sound is great, better than listening to music on my phone, and I like that you can ask questions when trying to find information and it will give an answer, very similar to Siri. I totally recommend the Google Home Mini Speaker."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Works Good,"I have been an Echo user for a couple years and it works well. I am also a Google Play music user and that service does not work on Echo.

There are some quirks that make it a little less user friendly than Echo, but if you never had the Echo, you wouldn't even know. I use these everyday with my home automation setup and it does a good job working with SmartThings."

The sound out of the mini is ok for alarms and interacting with the Google assistant but music will leave you wanting a bit more. For the sale price they're not bad, I have a few smart outlets I control with them and they work great for that. Just pair them up with a Bluetooth speaker if you plan on using them for music often."

5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great Smart Home Device,"My son received a Google Home Mini as a birthday gift. He was very excited to receive it and has loved having it in his bedroom. We already had 3 Echo Dot units, so this was a new device for our household. The set-up was easy from an iPhone. It connected to our wireless network immediately and has had no streaming issues. The audio quality of the speaker is excellent. He mostly uses it for listening to Pandora and Spotify, which were both easy to set up with his account. It also connects to his Google account with no issues. I know that he's very happy with it and it would make a great gift for most homes."
4.0,a month ago,homedepot.ca,Good for the price.,Seems limited in its capabilities but it's still new so it could just be a learning curve for both of us. I mainly bought it because it was on sale and I wanted it so I could listen to music on it while I use YouTube on my phone for instructional videos for different projects. It definitely serves it's purpose.

If it's good enough for bill gates to wander about commanding his house, it's good enough for me. And answers to questions are spoken back (not just a URL link). It's always improving, and of course Google's experts are just a phone call away, 24x7, if you need them. All in all, so much better than Alexa."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Best entry item for Google Home,With multiple in my house I believe this is the best way to get voice commands going for your smart home. The Google Home app allows you to take full control of the device enabling automations even if you don't have something like a Smartthings. Also the speakers are actually pretty decent for this little thing. I wouldn't expect a lot of base but it still does pretty good.
5.0,3 months ago,lowes.com,Easy to use!,We put this in a sitting room next to a baby nursery. It's super convenient to walk in the room with the baby in my arms and tell google to turn the lamp on. It's not super bright so if I had it in a living room I would add more bulbs. Set up is super easy like all google products. Would definitely buy more to go around the house.
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Perfect implimentation,"There is nothing better than technology that works the first time right out of the box. Google's implementation of the Google home &Google Home Mini is spot-on perfect. Plug it in, wait a moment, and Google home directs you exactly what to do, with no ifs ands or buts. I'm constantly amazed at how many commands the Google Home / Home Mini understands, and how well it annonciates the answer to questions, both mundane or esoteric. I have Google under voice control of all my table lights, floor lamps, desk lamps, ceiling lamps, heater and air conditioning, even my Roomba vacuum cleaner. I could put my refrigerator under Google control but can't figure out why I'd want to."

Setup was very easy just download the app and let it search for new device the light blinks a couple times and setup is complete, took 45 seconds. From the app or by voice command you can turn the light off or on and control brightness. WARNING:...This light my lead to laziness on the behalf of the user."
3.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Good 1st Effort,"This is somewhat of a glorified extension mic for my other two Google Home units. I took away one star for poor audio quality and one star for no 3.5mm audio out. BUT I needed Google Home to hear me in the basement/garage to control Philip Hue bulbs down there and also so I could still hear my music while dealing with the laundry. It handles both tasks just fine. No, the audio is not great but it beats not being able to hear the music at all. Would like to see this priced at $25 rather than $30 but as it handles voice commands as well as my larger Home units, the $30 is not unreasonable. The power cord is nice and long and I find the device aesthetically attractive (would like to see more color options too)."
5.0,a year ago,very.co.uk,Love this bit of tech!,"So good I purchased two! Decided to try this instead of the echo dot as have a sound-bar that has google chrome cast/home installed on it. I have to say that these are better than the dot! The speaker and mic quality is SO much better, there are a few things it cant do that the dot can but its all swings and roundabouts. The one in the lounge is able to link via wifi and play music from Google Play (Deezer and other apps but we use Google) seamlessly."
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Great device if you want to start on a smart home!,"It's a great compact device that has decent enough speakers to fill up a room with music, news, or hear broadcasts.

We got a smart thermostat too so I can be under the covers upstairs and ask google to turn the temp up without having to get up."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Love the mini,"I also have a Google home device but when I set the timer on the mini I asked the Google home how much time left on the timer and it didn't link the timer I already set with the mini. I wish it sync'd across the devices that way. It still connects to my lights when I ask mini to turn on/off said light because it is connected through the same app as the Google home.

Still learning all the things I can ask the Mini but so far, setting my alarm to Spotify music is the best feature ever. Won't have issues with alarms anymore!"
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Perfect for its purpose,"We are Google through and through, so love that TWO of these came with my Philips Hue Starter Kit!

It's awesome sauce if you've got little ones."
5.0,2 years ago,very.co.uk,Cleaver and affordable,I brought this item a month ago and it is brilliant. This speaker has all the same features as it's bigger brother the Google home but at a much more affordable price. It's so handy to be able to ask questions on the fly but couple this with some other smart tech like lights or power sockets and your well on your way to having an automated home. The speaker isn't the best so using this in the living room as your main music source isn't to everyone's taste but for something to listen to when your getting ready in the bedroom it's perfect. Purchase a chromecast audio device and you can connect this to any stereo system with a aux point. Brilliant piece of kit atba great price.
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Better speaker than the Echo Dot,"I bought this to compare to my Echo Dot. The Google speaker is far better than the speaker in the Dot, though I still doubt that I would use it for music. The Dot is better if you're looking to use it for home automation. It supports more devices and is easier to setup connections. The Google speaker is slightly easier to setup initially. It does most of the work itself. It can also answer a wider range of informational questions, and the integration with Chromcast for casting Netflix and other services to your TV is nice. It's quickly closing the gap with the Amazon Echo."

You won't be able to gift this and get the $25 rebate. Well you can, but you have to open it up and register it to yourself. Not a big deal since you can factory reset it, except you have to RIP the package to open it. The rebate is for WALMART on Google Express. Which is not the same thing as Walmart.com It has a very limited catalog. So far everything I've tried to search for on Google Express and Walmart I can't find. It's very frustrating. I'm not sure what the point is with Google Express, they must make money on it somehow. I wouldn't use it to shop with if not for this rebate. I hope I can find something I want to use the $25 with.

On it's own, the speaker is actually OK for listening to music quietly- but is of course much better to link it wirelessly to proper speakers with Chromecast as the small device doesn't have the bass and overall dynamic range you want for music. Personally I don't fine the microphones as receptive as I'd like - eg when playing music or of TV is on - but it's generally fine. Well worth it. Software on Home app has improved a bit too.

The Home Mini is plug-and-play out of the box (you set it up using your smartphone). From there, you can use it for straightforward functional requests (like, ""set a timer for 10 minutes,"" ""what is the temperature outside,"" ""what time is sunset""). The Home Mini was also pretty easy to sync with a Wemo Smart Plug (you can set up voice commands to turn lights on/off, etc.). The main negative is that it does not have a chargeable battery, so you need to have it plugged in at all times. The underlying software is also still a bit buggy. On the whole though, this is a useful and fun new product."

It works great with my Nest thermostat, Wemo switches, and Philips Hue light bulbs. The sound of this speaker is good for talking but leaves much to be desired when playing music. The bass is very shallow but that's to be expected because of its compact size."

5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Great smart speaker,Purchased for my daughter and she uses constantly. The device always knows the answer asked. Is a great alarm clock and is set to control the lights in her room. She loves it. The speaker sounds better than expected for listening to music in her bedroom.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great to get started or expand smart home,"I really like the mini. Lots of integration with 3rd party smart home tech. I usually link them via Bluetooth to other speakers so sound quality isn’t an issue. For the size, the sound is actually pretty good."
5.0,6 months ago,ebay.com,Google Home Mini,"The Google Home Mini arrived on time and is as represented. It works well as far as I know. I'm eager to find out all the things it is capable of. We positioned it in the main living area of the house so that my wife or I can ask it whatever question we want, and she almost always has an answer. She also has a sense of humor. Good buy!"

2.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,"Thought it would be great, but only lasted a year","I really wanted Google to beat Amazon Alexa, but this was not the case. Alexa can do so much more. After a year Google started resetting itself after asking a question. Alexa is working just fine and I have no plans to buy another Google Home product."
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Hey google!,"We ended up getting a few of these for the home. It is so easy to ask for information to be sent to our phones for later reminders and tasks to do. We love how all the google homes sync and play music throughout the house. Our nieces and nephews learn to use it and we require them to ask google with please and thank you’s. It is fun to wake up in the morning and tell google, “good morning!”"
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Surprisingly loud,"I haven't mastered many commands, but it's really convenient to set the alarm, and re-set it to snooze a bit longer without getting out of bed. Setup was easy, and re-setting up when I changed my wi-fi was also very easy. I wish the description of my commute was a little more detailed (i.e. google only tells me which route to take and approx how long it will take. It doesn't give locations of road accidents or other relevant info). And I don't use pandora or spotify. So it will play a specific song or artist in my library or Google Play, but if I ask for a playlist (say most popular pop songs), it's often stumped if a playlist with that specific name doesn't already exist in Google Play. I assume its AI will improve over time. Still very pleased with it for $30."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great little gadget for the price,"This is the 5th Google Home Mini I have bought and setup for various family members. The google home is great for the price, I use it just about every day. From asking questions to controlling the lights its a great value and a great tool for just about anyone."
5.0,a year ago,Currys,Margaret's review of Google Home Mini,"Pros: Quick and easy to install. Useful for operating a smart light and answering questions. I like to use it to play podcasts or read audiobooks. I find it's ability to add things to a shopping list useful. Cons: I find it irritating that I have to preface Google with OK or Hey but I suppose there's a good reason for it. I wish it would use my Keep shopping list as, with the present list, if I drop off the internet (which happens in the supermarket I use) I lose my list."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Very handy,"I got this for my daughters for their bedroom. They tend to leave the light on when they walk out and it's super easy to turn it off through the app, or yell upstairs to it. I like that I can track anything they say to it being they are 6 and 8. They love being able to ask it educational questions while doing homework, and playing music. It works great for an alarm clock as well. I will be buying a second one and more bulbs for the rest of my house."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Awesome gadget,We all know what the Google home is by now. I haven't tried the 2nd gen but this first one does everything I need it to do pretty well. Surprisingly it even plays music with decent quality. If you have a smart home or are just starting out you can't go wrong with a mini!
3.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,"Great assistant, bad light",Ok so the Google home mini is absolutely worth it. I use it all the time and it makes my life so much easier. The light was incredible while it worked. But it only lasted a couple weeks. Get the google home mini and skip the light.
5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Love it! Grandparents Love it! Great for Everyone!,"Excellent gif for families, great for those times you need a quick update on traffic and weather.

4.0,9 months ago,ebay.com,Mostly a good product,"Very efficient way to control every bit of your smart home through voice. Placing several units in key locations provides complete experience both in term of home control and optimal music volume.

5.0,3 weeks ago,Best Buy,It's worth it,"Picked one up for my less tech savy sister and she loves it. Set up is easy and works on either iphone or andriod and not needed after set up. Great for music, weather, recipes, controlling lights and great volume for size. Bought this on sale for $25, worth it!"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Good little speaker.,"I got this speaker to go with my Google Hub and the speakers in my bedroom. The quality is good, not great and not a Bose sound system. But I can tell google to play my music on home group and it will play on all speakers and chromcast TV. Which sounds really good. And all over the house, upstairs and down. Pluss it will cast to other Bluetooth speakers in your house as well. Like my Bose and JBL."

Also tells some pretty good jokes if you ask. When I have a question I just ask and ( if I phrase it clearly) provides a complete answer."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Works as Advertised,This worked as I would have expected - nothing remarkable other than the GE light that came with the Google product worked as it should; this is surprising since the very same bulbs I acquired last week have demonstrated a profound inability to work as they should (other than to light up). These bulbs are the same as the one that came with the google product and would not work with the google product (and the factory reset procedure is one of the worst ever designed so I gave up and just use them as bulbs). The google product recognized the ONE GE bulb and there was an easy process to install.
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Easy setup and use,"Got this product free with the purchase of a Nest doorbell. Very easy setup and usage. I really haven't explored all of the possibilities so my review score may increase over time. I only worry that now Google is listening and keeping all of my personal data! I already use a lot of Apple products and now Nest, so this is just another company competing for my privacy. Probably why is was given free."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,"Great product, great price","When home automation started to get popular I was the first person to say it's a waste of money, why would I talk to turn on lights or the tv when I could just manually turn them on. Well I was wrong, it's awesome, itll sing you songs and tell you bedtime stories and play games with you. It's learning new things every day and if you want to know all of what it can do look it up on youtube. Google will do that stuff, just as long as you buy the right lights and you either have a tv with Chromecast or have a Chromecast, with out that though it's just Google, so you have to pay to play to a degree. So go into this knowing you need to purchase the proper lights and Chromecast, it's an additional expense that adds up quick. If you have all the right products it's wonderful."

I used Google Assistant to link several other Smart Devices (Lights, A/C Outlets, Chromecast Audio Speakers, etc), and it is impressive to ask Google to turn specific lights or Rooms on or off. As a bonus, I found a 3rd party App that lets me stream ANY audio from my PC to all speakers, so now I have multi-room stereo!"

4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Great price, useful","I have been using the google mini for a couple months now and for the price have found it very useful. It is great for common tasks, asking about traffic while getting ready for work, setting a timer while you are cooking, asking quick google questions, asking about weather etc. Yes your phone can do all of this, but with these you dont have to touch your phone or be near it. The minis are worth it, especially when discounted, though im not sure the larger more expebsive ones are worth the bigger price tag."

After setting everything up, I was able to turn my lamp On & Off by voice. I was also able to adjust the brightness.

I was also able to control the light from my other Google Home I own."

We loved it so much for MUCH more we bought another to go along with an original Google Home--now 3 units. I then purchased 3 mini's for my elderly (87, 90) parents. They LOVE it after I trained them. It is used as a SAFETY device for them using BROADCAST having the units in different rooms. They can contact each other. They LOVE getting all kinds of information from their questions, and playing music. They are in awe and showing them off to friends. My son had 2 Google Homes and uses them with the smartphone to turn on lights, and wake up the school kids, etc. They all LOVE the units...kids love the games and music."

I can’t wait to use the story time app."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Easy to set up and quite useful. Good value.,"This plug-in electronic internet device is compact yet enables one to have easy access to much of the vast information collected by Google. It is similar to Amazon’s Alexa, but less expensive and it has very good sound quality for playing music. It will not play specific songs without a subscription but will play generic music stations without commercials. We have two Minis: one in the bedroom where we ask for weather and news and in the morning and where we listen to soft music at night before setting a morning alarm. The other mini is in one dining room kitchen where we listen to music and ask for answers and simple Spanish traslations."

5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,It's nice to have,"Works just like the larger Google Home, I mostly use this as ambient noise for sleeping, and occasionally for music or news when getting ready for work.

1.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Half baked, and vanishing features","1) Unable to voice match with my phone, making me having to repeat ""OK, Google"" a few times over before it ever responds. It completely ruins the experience. 2) Does not work on a guest wifi network. 3) Vanishing features. One particular feature I really liked was a ""sleep routine"" where I'd be able to set my phone on silent using the Mini. 1 week later Google roles out an update forcing you to use your phone for that specific routine. Hmm, thanks Google for fixing that."
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great product,Pros: 1. Easy to setup and use for home automation. 2. compatible with multiple devices on the market. 3. Support for music apps like Spotify and TuneIn.

I have many old classical songs which i can't link it to google to play enforces to pay for music subscription3. too much consumerism than actual entertainment4. doesnot detect family persons..5. Doesnot remind anything at all on programmed time, despite it records all reminders but no use.."
4.0,a week ago,Best Buy,Helpful,"I have these in every bedroom and the main living space.

Great alarm clocks, reminders, quick answers, and so much more!"
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great voice companion for those sleepy mornings!,"I have both the Alexa and Google Home products as well as their respective smaller versions. The Google home mini is a great tool that doesn't clash too much with your home decor. Although the speaker is not as loud as the original home, it has every functionality as the original google home. It also has touch sensors on top of the speaker for volume control but you can just ask the mini to reduce the volume. I really see no fault in this product and while it is on sale this holiday season, I wouldn't mind getting one for each bedroom and bathroom. I would get the bigger versions for larger spaces such as the living room or kitchens."
4.0,a year ago,Office Depot,Great sound but a little glitchy,"The speaker sounds great and most things run smoothly. However it got hung up on a couple things, like I asked for one recipe and then when I asked for another completely different type of recipe it kept giving me the first one over and over. The only other issue I had was using Bluetooth to hands free my phone, it wouldn’t or couldn’t access my contacts but I could dial by number. Overall it’s a nice addiction."

Placed in various locations of the house they are useful for listening to the radio, giving weather reports, turning up or down the heating, switching on lights and lots of other various actions. Easily connected to the Google Home app on my phone and linked to my Google account. Remarkably detects the voice of both me and my wife, but not others..!! I may still buy a couple more. Very happy with my purchase."

Can play music, get recipes, jokes and so much more with just saying “hey google” and then ask for what I want.

5.0,a year ago,Target,I love it!,It is so nice to walk in the door at night & verbally have Google turn on the lights instead of me fumbling to find light switch. I also have the option to turn lights on before I get home or when out of town by using the app. I’ve used it to make hands free phone calls & as alarm in the morning. You can check your commute to work & the weather without having to stop & use your iPad. Can’t say enough good things. Have bought a couple for each of my family members.
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Fun little gadget to use!,I received this for free when I bought a smart thermometer and it is fun to use! I really like using it as an alarm - in case I forget to set it before I hop in bed I can just verbally ask it to wake me up at a certain time. I also use it when I’m in the shower and it is loud enough even over the drumming of the water and the fan.
2.0,2 years ago,bestbuy.ca,Still very limited in features,"Frustrating that some key features that are available on the Android phone assistant aren't available on the Google Home. - Can't callup youtube; - can't read or write text messages; - streaming from laptop/phone is not a one-click step and only possible from google browser/youtube; - can't set location and change reminder time when booking meetings; - when streamed, youtube is cast with annoying lag - sound quality is below average. My Blue Piston speaker has more base and is louder, although smaller in size. - Also, extremely annoying that the assistant on the phone gets deactivated when near Google Home - Should be good for news, but I prefer to read/watch news, but I heard that functionality is good Decided to return and wait until Google Home gets smarter"

John Lewis and Google technical support confirm that Hotmail can't be used and I think the message was that one must use gmail. I have a gmail address I never use, so in exasperation I entered that. After proceeding I then got a message that my iPhone could not connect with the speaker and that I should change the settings of my Virgin Media (fibre-optic) router. This was followed by complicated instructions. Since all my mail comes to Hotmail, I didn't want to have to check gmail as well, so I'm returning the three minis.

Its stylish and discreet and sound quality is good. You would need more than one if you wanted these around the house. You need to be in the same room. This would make a great gift."

5.0,2 years ago,staples.com,Cool little device,"I have both amazon's echo line and a few of these Mini's by google and I actually prefer the Google devices. The sound on this compared the the Echo Dot is far louder and the mesh design and curved edge looks nice in your home. The biggest difference between the two is voice control. Google has had years to refine its ""Voice & talk"" algorithms and it shows here. You can pretty much have an ongoing conversation with the Mini at this point and it comes in handy especially if you have a google play music or Youtube red account. It also syncs with your Netflix account and any Chromecast devices in your home. At this price its pretty much a no-brainer."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Smarter than Echo Dot,"This device has better sound than Echo Dot and is much ""smarter"". It recognizes different voices and integrates with many more apps. I love pairing it with the Chromecast for a great TV experience. I got another one free with a Nest Hello doorbell camera, and the Mini announces when someone is at the door - and who it is since Nest does facial recognition. Crazy awesome tech!"

Having tried both it and Amazon Echo I feel the Google Home is far superior. The Mini allows extension around the home at a very reasonable cost.

Cons: Limited choice of music is offered out of the box via 'hey google'. Although once linked to spotify free a fairly wide choice can be made by asking google to 'play this is ...' which plays a random playlist of an artist's music.The default seems to play a predefined playlist that includes the artist you ask for (eventually)."

Then a $10 gift card was included in the purchase but not once during the entire purchasing process was it ever mentioned that one would have to request the gift card instead of just getting one? Maybe it's me and my lack of purchasing through the Verizon website but I have never seen a more complicated process to obtain a gift card!

It was extremely easy to set up with the app from my Android phone and once connected to the wifi it started up immediately. You simply ask questions or request information and Google responds. The sound is very good and easy to listen to. It will connect to a variety of apps. We use it most with Pandora for music and it is outstanding in sound quality.
2.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Works but not as a BT speaker for video from PC,I did get this for free with the purchase of another product so maybe I shouldn't complain too much. But the fact of the matter is there is a really big technical problem. If you intend to use this as a speaker for your laptop or desktop computer you might want to wait. I tried it as an external Bluetooth speaker for my desktop and the latency or lag between lips moving on my screen and the audio output from the Google Mini is maybe 0.5 second. It is unusable. I have a Harman/Kardon Bluetooth speaker also and it is not doing this and the sync is perfect so i know its the Mini. It does seem to be doing voice control correctly. Actually maybe better than my Alexa...

We got ours when they were on sale for 29.99 so it was a great deal as well. Ended up buy some extra ones for family. They seem to enjoy it also. If there is a problem I have with it, it would be that you have to think about what you want to say before you say ""hey google"" otherwise youll keep trying to figure out how to word what you want it to do (if that makes sense). You learn and/or get used to it after a little bit though and is handy when you have random questions or thoughts you want an answer to."

If I try to delete a reminder it goes through the list, then ask which one. It would be great just to tell it what one to delete. Love that it tells me how long the commute is to work when asked. I like that you can set the volume level by saying hey Google set volume at 5, or you can say 50 percent. It is really loud on max volume, but still very clear!

My kids love it...
2.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Limited Use,"The Google Home mini is a product in direct response to the Amazon Echo dot. It is tied to your Google account and relies on that. I would have preferred it to have a more standard usb charger instead of the one that comes with (one-piece with non-detachable outlet plug), and the on/off switch is inconveniently positioned making it difficult to switch on/off at a moments notice, and the microphone is generally less reliable/sensitive than the Echo Dot, also there is no source input which cripples your ability to play anything other than what Google wants you to. The sound of the speaker is just about the same as the Echo Dot. All in all, you'll want to purchase this if you rely on Google Assistant as opposed to Amazon's limited Alexa. Despite Google's crippling closed-source implementation of the product, it's not bad for $30.Less"

4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Works really well,"This does a pretty good job of understanding spoken words and then performing the requested task. In that regard it Google Now kicks Siri's butt. That said, there are some things that I should be able to do that it doesn't. I hear ""I'm sorry. I don't know how to do that yet."" a little too often. The things I ask it to do to other smart devices in the house that are google compatible are not complicated things."
5.0,a year ago,lowes.com,Google Hime Mini,"The family and I absolutely love the google home mini. Its conveniently priced so that you could have one in every room and not break the bank. The kids love asking the google mini questions, and telling it to play music. It’s nice when your busy in the morning and can just ask it what the forecast is. Also pretty awesome that you can have google add stuff to your calendar. Should definitely be apart of every home."

3.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,"Good, but frustrating at times.","It will hear you 6 out of ten times. Maybe 7 out of ten that's not bad, but it definitely gets annoying. You can be heard perfectly all day, but suddenly the quiet house you're in isnt good enough for Google to hear/recognize you. It gets old. But it does do it's job well when it hears you. I'll give it that."
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Fun Gadget!!,"Got Google Mini, because my sister-in-law had one, and I saw what this little gadget could do. We leave the dog home and in a crate when we are gone. ask Google to play our favorite radio station and it streams the music for the dog to listen to while are gone. Ask forecast or weather and it responds right away, even ask it to tell you a joke!!"
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Weak as a speaker but great for its purpose,"If you are looking to add smart home control to your home, the minis are the answer. The audio quality isn't the best but for the price it performs surprisingly well. The minis seem to be able to hear your ""hey google"" better then the bigger more expensive google homes. Also was even able to hear and respond quite well to my 3 year old nephew. Paired multiple minis to my hue lights, smart thermostat, multiple chromecasts, and a few off brand smart sockets throughout my house and having so much fun controlling everything with my voice. I enjoyed mine so much I went back and bought 6 more as gifts."
4.0,a year ago,walmart.com,My little buddy,Absolutely love my little Google buddy. I mostly use it to manage alarms and play music and it's great at that. its more responsive than Alexa in my opinion. This decvice is also great for answering those random questions that pass through your head. although with the alarms I wish I choice set my own personal song. for years I have woken up to on my way from brother bear. and it's been weird not hearing it every morning.
5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Google Home Mini,"Great item with a very impressive speaker and clarity. You can pretty much ask and tell it to do anything you would normally do with Google. I control Pandora,Netflix,Weather Info,Notes & as variety of so many things. If you have a Chromecast it's able to control that as well! You tell it to turn it to whatever volume you want,set timers and alarms and even control your lights & thermostat (check compatibility with (nest & bulbs)to link thru Wi-Fi. So so much more......"

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,I have 2 Echoes and now a Google Home,"I’ve had the Amazon Echo for 2 years now. I also have an Echo Dot in one of the bedrooms. I have this in the Master Bedroom. It is a good alternative to Echo. All my home automation is set with the Echo and I haven’t set it up with the Mini yet. As far as functionality, it does well. I like the alarm to wake up to. It is gentle sounding compared to Alexa. It has fun games that the kids and wife play. I did try controlling Chromecast which my bedroom TV has that Alexa can’t control. It works well. I can say Hey Google, show trending videos. And the top videos play. I can skip and pause hands free. Petty neat. Google does a better job with inquiries. Echo is better with home automation and has a huge lead start on skills/apps. I don’t think it will replace my Echo. Just complement it. You can’t go wrong with either, but stick to one brand if you plan to put one in every room.Less"
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,An awesome surprise...,"I was a little skeptical buying a virtual assistant but was swayed by the low prices during Thanksgiving weekend so I picked one of these up to try. I will definitely say that this has been one of the best value purchase I have ever made. It was very helpful around our bedroom and it is very entertaining. Sound is better than your phone and laptop speaker but don't expect high end quality sound. I use it listening to radio through TuneIn and if you have a Spotify account, you can connect it and the Google Mini will play any song. I am planning to buy some more for gifts and for our living room. Even if you don't think you need this, I am very sure you would enjoy it when you get it."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Lots of function for the price,"Sale price made it irresistible and after a few months we are still using it. We stream Pandora on it, use it as a timer and alarm clock, check the weather, and ask random questions without having to put on glasses and look it up on my phone. There are features I would like to use more, such as the custom news feed, but that's just a function of not having time. We haven't added any smart devices for it to control but even without them I've gotten my money's worth."

5.0,a year ago,Target,Google light kit,I have Alexa and the Google speaker with the light is such a better product. It is such a great speaker which lets you control the light too.

I plan to buy several for Christmas gifts.

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Google Mini = Great,"If I had to pick between Alexa and Google, I would pick Google. Google understands you a whole lot more then Alexa and is always learning and has a lot more support with 3rd party applications. If you ask a question and follow up again with another question about the same topic, Google knows you just asked something similar. One thing I love is I use it as my alarm clock in the morning and have it set to different times and I don't have that annoying clock light on all night."

Highly recommended!"
3.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Product not reliable,The google mini isn’t living up to its hype. Does always follow through on a command. Example I’ll say hey google play classic rock and it’ll say ok here’s a classic rock channel on Pandora but then nothing happens. I’ll repeat then the channel plays.

5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great Smart speaker!,If you are not looking for anything big this is perfect! It does everything the big Google home does accept the speaker is smaller and has less audio quality. But if you are just using it for smart commands and not as a full time speaker this is a great option!
3.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,"Good, but talks too much","The google home mini is a nice looking smart assistant with the great Google search behind it. But it has some short comings. First of all, you can't change the phrase to get the device's attention, wich are the same for using the assistant on your Android phone, so your Android phone can also answer. The device talks too much when confirming your actions as operated to the Amazon Alexa's simple""OK"". There are no physical buttons so it could be a little confusing to manually control the device. Some of the good features are the ability to change the assistant voice, recognizing a person by their voice, and the ability to accommodate multiple users and distinguish among them by voice."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Love the mini. Interface needs work.,"I love the Google mini. I purchased it on Black Friday for $25. A great buy. The Google Home app integration needs a bit of work. I wanted to set a routine to turn on my TV and light when I announced ""I'm home."" Both of the devices showed up in the ""room"", but only one would add to the routine. Customer support walked me through a workaround, but it was clearly a workaround. Should have been easier."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,I own 4 of these,"I love the google home minis for adding music and controls in each of my rooms in addition to my sound system with the Chromecast audio.

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Handy for asking quick questions, making lists","I grew up on ST:TNG, so talking to a computer is something I've always wanted. This is handy for asking quick questions (though the answers aren't always great), adding stuff to a shopping list on the fly, setting reminders that pop up on your phone, or starting a timer. Playing music generally requires a subscription to Google Play Music or something similar. You can ask it what is in the news and get a good run down of the top news stories from a sequence of sources like NPR, Fox News, etc."

I would not recommend using this speaker as your only speaker for music but in the bedroom, bathroom or even a small kitchen it’s great.

It just keeps saying ""an error occurred"". No direction, no sense. You can't talk to a real person to get help you need to write to a forum and spend days waiting for a reply. It did connect to my Sonoffs but them wouldn't control them. To me as a home control device it fails miserably. Amazon Echo is so much easier and works far better. I returned the Mini..."

Wish my mom could have had one when she lost her sight in her later years. She would have really enjoyed it."
3.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,well...doesnt live up to the hype,"You can ask google any question you want to and thats great. Thats the good news. The not so good news, is it isnt smart enough to do anything more than a very simple search online for information. Its very easy to ask it questions that it cannot answer. I frequently end up going to the computer and doing a manual search for the information I want the old fashioned way which sort of negates the point of having this little gadget. But its fun to play with and it may get better with time as it downloads better software and learns how to do more. Time will tell. Didnt cost a ton of money, but as it currently stands, I dont really feel like I got what I paid for. Your mileage may vary. :)"
5.0,a month ago,ebay.com,Google cant fault it really,"this is standard google assistant much better answers than Alexa but not so integrated with smart home so im running 9 Alexas to control home and 6 google home minis for internet answers , in a while i will decide which Eco system i really prefer until then i'm happy as it is. highly recommend both google and Alexa depending on needs ."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Bundle with 2 Great Products!,The Google Home Mini alone is a great deal and does so much. I have it in my living room and I enjoy asking it questions or setting up routines so I get news while preparing for the day. The included light bulb makes the deal even better so I can remotely turn on my light or use it in the routine so my light turns on before I even get into the kitchen. I would recommend this bundle for a person just starting their smart home setup.
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,A lot of fun!,"When these were on sale over the holidays for $29, I got one as a present. My kids and I opened it up and tested it out. You can set timers and play games. There is ton's of things you can use with google home. I found out that you can make an announcement and control lighting with them using my existing systems. I ended up getting a Google home for all the major rooms. We can listen to music, stream podcasts, control lights and play games. There are more than 50 games. Lists are all online. You can also use the speaker as a small Bluetooth speaker. This is much easier than the DOT from Amazon. I have those also. I am waiting for the Apple device but suspect it will be too expensive. I spent about $130 to cover the house. My wife sets timers for cooking, the kids etc."

4.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Love this smart donut,The Google Home Mini is the size of a donut and is really a speaker with smart capabilities when setting up with a home Wi-Fi network. It has a microphone on/off switch and a USB cord output that connects to a power plug because it needs to be powered from a wall outlet. Integration with other smart home services is superficial.
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Fun and Useful,"These things are fun and useful. I always wanted a smart home and suddenly Best Buy had the Google mini home on sale and I bought a set of Phillips lights too. Set up was super easy and soon I was in control of 4 lights. Then quite by accident, I saw a U-Tube video of what the Mini Home can do. So I bought a second Mini Home so my soft spoken fiancee could broadcast to me in the living room. One of the benefits is the Phillips lights can be programmed turn on when you come home so you never walk into a dark home. The Mini home is easy to set up, easy to learn and train. I am extremely happy with them and plan on automating as much of my house as I can afford it."
5.0,a year ago,Target,Great AI,"What can I say? We have now two of these devices, one in my son's room, and one in the living room.

Echo uses Bing, and Home uses, of course, Google. Asking questions is better on Home, and that's why we got this one for the living room after my son absconded with the one he put in his bedroom."
2.0,a year ago,Bed Bath & Beyond,Hard to set up,"Considering it is a Google product, you would think that the set up would be easy. There are no instructions other than to download an app. Once you download the app, it does not provide step of which features to activate. Every time we ask Google to do something (especially play music) she tells us that she needs more information and that can be done in the Google app. I would highly recommend trying the Alexa rather than Google."

The device is great, equal to the Echo and a bit better in terms of sound. The echo has a greater number of devices that work with it (I found this out when one of my home smart plugs didn't work with the google home). However the google home is actually ""smarter"" than the echo. The questions I asked were more likely to be answered (and correctly) by the google home than the amazon echo. It's a fun device and since my phone's an android, it integrates very well. I will be switching over to this device and re-gift my echo devices."

I think its unfair to try to pair it to the larger Google Home unit but to be honest the mini holds its own very well. The sound is full and more than I expected to be honest. I am the type of person that likes a balance between highs, mids, and lows. I don't want overbearing bass as some may prefer. The unit is small yet very powerful. Honestly, Google should have launched this device months ago. I actually purchased a total of 3 that compliment my larger Google Home unit."

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Awesome help but has wifi connection issues,"I put my Mini in the kitchen, and it's been a great help. I also have the Google Home main unit, and it's really helped to have the Mini so I don't have to yell in hopes that the Home will hear me ask it a question or set a timer. Connecting it with the pre-existing Home was super easy. It gets great sound and is usually really fast. It's had some wifi connection issues since day 1, but I suspect this is because the kitchen is distant from my modem & there are walls to interrupt the signal. Lately there's been some data package issues with all Google Home devices that makes your wifi shut down, so my Homes are pretty useless right now until Google releases a fix."

1.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Useless for anything but my play lists,I truly hate this thing I’m just going to list all the problems I have with it 1)It took 3 days for it to recognize my voice and even still listened to everyone else’s voice instead of me and I had to reset it EVERY TIME 2) You try to give it a command/ask questions and all it says is “I’m sorry I don’t know what you mean but I’m still learning” It’s so bad it couldn’t even tell me the weather. 3) claims it can hook up to ITunes another Nope tried for several days that doesn’t work either. 4) the only thing this is good for is playing music cause if you give it anything else to do it’s apparently completely incompetent. Also even with google play if I tell it to play a specific list and it will play whatever it wants instead of what I requested I even thought saying please would work nope it didn’t. This is the most useless piece of junkLess

5.0,5 months ago,ebay.com,I love this Google mini,It is amazing how much information you get from this little mini. I use mine several times a day. When you play music on it the sound is terrific. Hard to believe it comes from this little speaker. I highly recommend it to anyone.
3.0,2 years ago,bestbuy.ca,"Great gadget, but sounds muffled","It's pretty much as I expected. Doesn't do everything I hoped initially, but it does enough to be useful and interesting, and I'm sure Google will continue to improve the back end service over time. As every reviewer points out, the lack of a stereo output jack limits its usefulness as a Chromecast speaker, and while music sounds ok for the small size, the voice output sounds muffled to me. I didn't expect that to be so poor given that it's the main function. It is a good listener - I can shout to it from another floor of the house, and it will hear and take action. I just can't make out the response from that distance because of the muffled speech output."

Non-tech folks will be a bit confused with interfacing with this but will eventually find it an extremely helpful assistant. I got one for my parents and they use it to cook, play music, and learn languages. Want the news or weather? Ask. Pretty neat but not a game changer.... yet."

It hears me speak from about every room in our house. The only thing I wish it had is the ability to attach it to an external speaker for music. It actually has great sound for such a small object. We have had it since the Holidays. You can't beat this product for pricing and the information that is available on it. The sky is the limit when asking it questions. It's actually great entertainment as well and it definitely meets our expectations.

Right out the box the setup was very simple and the home app pretty much walks you through the entire setup as it does with most Google products. At first we used it for simple things for example playing Pandora, and netflix. As time has passed we've started adding home automation to it as well and so far I've been very pleased with the results. My children have also started figuring out a lot of the cool things it can do like reading stories and playing music on the Chromecast in their room. I plan on adding several more home mini's as well as the full sized to be the backbone of my full home automation."

The Lowes employee even asked me if I had picked up the product already. WTF. So I asked for a refund after 30 minutes of this non-sense, then the employee got to the bottom of it all -- Lowes was out of stock and had already refunded the purchase. Yeah, they sent me a note to pickup a product that was out of stock, AND they didn't tell me that they refunded me an any messages, voice or email. About the Mini - I bought one elsewhere for the same price, and so far it's not Alexa, but it works."

Opened it and started playing with it while I was with my 71 year old Grandmother and at first she thought it was just a way for people to be lazy, but the more she saw it could do, the more impressed she was! Ended up getting me to pick one up for her because she doesn't need to techie at all, she can just speak and the mini helps her out with setting timers, alarms, remembering where things are, and finding her cell phone. It's a fantastic tool for anyone, any age group, any technology level! I love the entire line! My home will slowly be switching to more and more smart tech!"

5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,This product is very good for streaming music.,"Overall I love my google home mini. I am able to ask ""google"" many questions and it responds just like Siri and Alexae, but in a more smarter way. Be wary, you must install the google home app in your Iphone or Android device to register and use the product. The best thing about the google mini is that the speakers sound extremely clear and crisp and can reach VERY high volume levels when streaming music via Spotify or whatnot. The only downside to this product is that it must be plugged into an outlet of some sort because it does not even have a battery, which hinders it from being able to travel with it."

What's the weather in Los Angeles? Who are the Rams playing? Set a timer... Set an alarm, play Pandora, find a recipe. There's so much it can do. Unfortunately there's also a lot it doesn't know which can be frustrating. They say it's always learning, but its limitations can still be frustrating. Sometimes you have to word your question in a very specific way before it understands. Still, it's fun to have around and I use it everyday. This mini is a huge bargain!"

The mini is just the right size to tuck in on and end table or hang on a wall.

Volume controlled by app or touching sides. Latter works well. Does not have touch pause/stop/resume sensitive top. On/off switch at the back. Now have 2 Homes and 2 Minis around the house.

It is a simple device, plug it in to the wall socket that's it for the hardware. You need an additional android device (at 4.4 or newer) in order to add it to your router and complete the setup. That's my complaint. I shouldn't have to have yet another device to set this up. By the way, even if you get it set up, set up for multiple users voices doesn't work with just any android 4.4 device. That is why I gave it 4 stars (instead of 5). It works very well with Smartthings and with Logitech Harmony."

I may use it for a timer for cooking or asking question. It is limited to what you can ask. The big issue is that it is always listening, I often have it unplugged when it isnt in use. I dont like that when you mute the mic a light turns. I dont like it that it listens to the tv and will randomly talk. This is a deal breaker for many people"

4.0,2 years ago,Bed Bath & Beyond,A small Google assistant,"This Google home surprised me. I didn't do my research beforehand to find out that they permanently disabled the top touch pad which takes away the only physical way to stop music/prompt the assistant in the first place. Seems like a manufacturing defect had a few of them constantly activating on their own so Google had to disable the top touch pad through a software update. Other than that it's what you'd expect, you can get the assistant to do various tasks, such as streaming music or casting to a chromecast, etc. The speaker it has isn't the best obviously but it's good enough considering the price and form factor. If you wanted to have access Google's assistant for a low price, this is your best bet."

I'm left with a feeling of what's the real purpose of them though. They do several things well, but nothing that there aren't other avenues to do the same thing. I fell for the hype that because this device was part of the Google network it would be so much better at answering questions. Maybe a bit, but not enough to buy it over any other just for that possibility. It's still pretty danged easy to stump it and be told it's working on learning how to do that."

I can talk naturally with normal volume at the furthest point... no shouting required to active the device even when music is playing. Music quality is not bad as some report... of course I have it set at about 55% of max; it is better than my Samsung S8+, Macbook Pro and Samsung Level Box Slim bluetooth speakers if that helps with comparing it to something.

Still, it has good voice recognition and my next step is to pair it with smart plugs. My kids love it as a quick resource when they want to look up something also. Spotify works well with this and there was no problems casting music from my phone to the google speaker. Overall, for $29.00 it's worth looking into."

The ONLY thing I tend to get agitated is when you first set it up, it WILL recognize those annoying commercials where an actor says “hey google” then it tries to do whatever is said. Other than that, EXCELLENT product and the sound on it is great too! I have 2 and when playing music together with them, you get a really good sound quality that fills the space!"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,I made the switch!,"I made the switch from Alexa to Google Home and am VERY pleased. It recognizes what room you are in. So, I can say ""Hey Google, turn off the lights"" instead of ""Hey Alexa, turn off the back bedroom lights."" I like the Google home app better. I find the speaker understands when I speak better so I don't have to continue repeating myself. Also, I find the speaker works better when asking it questions."

Now for the not so good, the sound is lacking compared to the Echo 3. There isn't a intercom. If Google could improve these two issues, you would be king of AI."

It works and sets up simply, however some of the things Google Home claims it does have not worked perfectly.

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great addition to my home!!,"This is my first smart home speaker. I started with Philips hue color lights all over. It’s so much easier to control my lights now with just my voice. I can control many of my chrome cast ready devices and speakers. Everything just seems to work. You do have to play around with the google home app and get to know the ecosystem to get the most out of it. I will definitely be gettting another one in the future. One negative thing I’d say is that there Is only one speaker and when I’m playing fairly loud music on my sound system, the google home mini just won’t hear me. I have to yell sometimes which is a bit absurd."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Little Speaker, Cool Ecosystem","I will keep this short and sweet. Google assistant is great, this speaker is loud but lacks bass, and this is a great compliment to a smart home. I wouldn't use this as a stand alone music device, but it works great as part of the Google Home Ecosystem. I have a home, hub or mini in each room and all act together to control other smart devices in my home."
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Nice assistant,"My husband was forever asking me questions because he was too lazy to look them up, so I bought this for him and he LOVES it!

4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Effective for small spaces,"This device is definitely not for large spaces or using as a music-streaming hub, but it gets the job done for a great price. The mic is able to easily pickup commands from a room away. The audio quality is not great, and I'd recommend the full-sized Google Home if you're looking for a single Smart Home hub. However, I think this is great if you just want to try it out. You'll be surprised how often you find yourself saying ""hey Google..."""

My favorite part is that it is a cheap way to get a whole-home audio system. Casting music across all or a selection of the speakers is awesome when I want to fill the house with music. They definitely don't produce the best quality sound, but its definitely good enough. It fills a room pretty easily.

3.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great for a Google or Android home,"The Mini is good for those already embedded in the Google and Android universe but is limited for those in the Apple realm. It sounds better than the Amazon Echo Dot but is limited in it's ability to communicate across platforms and requires a Chromecast to communicate or broadcast to other devices. The lack of a line out is also inconvenient along with it's inability to broadcast to a bluetooth device (Both of which the Echo Dot can do). That said.... it sounds good, answers questions more accurately than the Echo Dot. I use it as an alarm, weather announcer and to answer basic questions mostly, but I got it around Christmas for $20 so don't feel I wasted the money."

And I love the morning setting when I ask it to tell me about my day and it goes through my appointments my calendar and then the top news stories.

Now I can turn on and off the bedside lamp from anywhere in the house. I like to tell the mini to play the sound of the ocean and the sound lulls me to sleep. I’ve also had it tell me stories and play music. Sometimes i add things to my shopping list. I plan to buy another one and have it delivered to my son for his birthday.
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Nice first smart home speaker,"Generally, I'm satisfied. I'm an Android-only user, with a chromecast and a chromecast audio, so the integration is solid. Compatibility is much better than an Alexa, which I've tried but could not cast to or control chromecast. Paired with IFTTT, the power of automation only increases. The speaker output is pretty significant, so I rarely keep it at max volume. Only issues are mic not being able to pick up your voice over loud noise, which is obviously unavoidable, but still gets annoying after trying to get its attention multiple times using a loud voice."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Fun and Functional,"Fun to use and to learn how to take advantage of its capabilities. Use it from recipes to my daily alarm clock.

Will probably pick up a couple more to place in other rooms."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Pretty good for the price, need smart home stuff","Overall I like this for the price. The speaker sound is ok, but I wouldn’t listen to music all the time on it.

If you’re not too concerned about sound quality, and/or if you have smart home miscellany, this is pretty good."

I use it with my TV and Chromecast, useful to turn on TV or put on a show on Netflix or Youtube but to change volume or choose specific Youtube videos it's annoying to ask google every time, or to unlock your phone (and drain its battery) to use it as a remote control. A lot of times it wont listen to its call (Hey google) while music is playing, and it gets confused if there's other people talking in the background (even if it's the TV or similar).

But if you really try to use it in our daily life, you will get to a point where having one in the living room, kitchen, bathroom, and more will be beneficial."
2.0,2 years ago,walmart.com,"Have both, get Alexa instead","I have a Google Home in my office and Alexa in my kitchen. First, Alexa has worked flawlessly. Google Home sometimes has issues connecting to the wifi despite sitting right next to the router. My computer is fine with the wifi, but GH won't connect. Then I have to try and set it up again and it won't want to connect. Arrgh! This has happened twice in the 8 weeks we've had it. Alexa also has a much better music selection if you are an Amazon Prime member. For the GH, you have to subscribe to their music service for a monthly fee. And that monthly fee won't get you free two-day shipping like Amazon Prime."

Like an iPad in that you think you really don't need this, but once you have it have no idea how you managed without one. Very easy to install, and I am not an IT enthusiast. I use it mainly for music linked to Spotify and BBC and so easy to change what you are listening to by a voice command . Haven't fired many questions at it, but it will give me a weather report!"

Very very cool item, I even bought a second one and the large one for my daughter."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Why type when you can ask?,"We love it for search! We have had Alexa (echo dot) for about a year and use this to control are home and integrate a lot of skills, but let's face it she is terrible at search. We love just to be able to ask what we normally would google and for the price you can't go wrong. A couple of other real nice things are the fact the weather is simple unless you ask for more detail and when asking for detailed information like recipes it will walk you through allowing you to say next or go back. Alexa just sends it to your app. If your serious about a smart home you need both, if you want home automation go with alexa (also she has a better sense of humor) but if you want information and a better speaker and a small profile you must have google mini."

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great and easy set up,My old google home mini started lowering its volume and I was having a hard time figuring out the cause of it and I didn’t want to let it go as I just bought it after Christmas. However luckily I added the Geek Squad protection which allowed me to exchange it out for a new one. I ordered this little one and picked it up at a different Best Buy. Also I prefer coral color over the chalk and charcoal.
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,I enjoy these a lot,"The home minis are not perfect but they are a great deal. We have 4 of them in the house combined with 3 Chromecast audio that allow us to sync the music all over the house with a simple voice command. We love the intercom broadcast feature but I wish that I could use it to broadcast to a chosen speaker instead of always all of them. Considering they are always updating the features, I hope they will make this happen in the future."
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,A simple way to get into Google Home,"Google Assistant in general is very useful: lists, news, shopping, search, alarms, etc. Voice commands feature is good, but still being fine tuned as wording has to be exact or the assistant won't do what you want. Ability to sync multiple Home devices is very useful, can have whole home sound without volume being too loud in any one room. As one would expect, speaker on the mini is less than ideal, but still very functional. Won't get much bass, but will do for simple listening, especially when augmenting another device while synced. Small foot print and nice aesthetic makes it blend in well."

I do like the Alexa for some features that are tied to Amazon; however, I do believe that the Alexa edits what is available. The Google home consistently plays the content that I want to hear and is by far the winner on being able to answer questions on the Fly.

4.0,2 years ago,Currys,Tim's review of Google Home Mini,"Pros: It is fun to use the Google Mini to control the lights and sockets. It is very easy to set up home automation. We use it a lot to listen to music and love the fact that you can set defaults so you can listen through existing speakers using a Chromecast rather than just the small Google Mini speaker (which does produce a reasonable sound)It has surprisingly been a help with the kids homework. ""Hey Google....How do you spell....."" ""....what is a....."" etc Cons: No bad points except you sometimes have to specific. Eg It doesn't know how to switch on the ""Lounge Light"" because it is actually the ""Living Room Lamp""Not a massive issue and easily resolved by renaming items and rooms to what you would call them.If you want to take full advantage of home automation it gets expensive buying lights, sockets, thermostats etcLess"
5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Great smart home assistant,Small device with big benefits. Easy set up and link to your Google account.

5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great product,"I have both Google Home and Amazon Echo Dot. I also have a Harmony Hub and several smart home devices. I love the smart home integration and once you activate lights and your entertainment center with your voice, good luck going back. For now, the Echo has better integration with my smart home, but once Google Home catches up, I will be switching to Google. The speaker is amazingly loud when playing music I also have an echo dot and I loved it but the speaker is not very loud the first time I told my Google home mini to play music from my Spotify and I turn the volume all the way up I was blown away buy how good it sounded."
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Smarter than Alexa but not as responsive,I love it so much that I went and got a Goggle Home for the living area and kept my mini for the bedroom. Love that it can play music directly from your youtube and it's smarter than Alexa. I gave my Alexa away once I got the Google Home. The only negative thing I noticed compared to Alexa is that it's not as responsive. Sometimes I would have to say Hey Google a few times for it to work. Alexa usually responds right away. The main negative compared to Siri is that Siri gives you verbal response when you activate it. Google lights up but gives no verbal response.

You can turn the light on or off, or dim it. It also comes with a Google Home Mini that is fully functional. A Great Christmas gift (for me)."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Good not great,"I have both the echo dot and now the home mini. It does the same function as the dot. The speaker is decent, not great.

Not as personable so to speak as the echo dot, but Overall I would recommend it."

3.0,a year ago,walmart.com,Not So Smart 'Smart Light',The lightbulb works great with Google Mini. However there is not an option to schedule the light to turn off and on at a specific time which was my primary reason for purchasing the Smart Lightbulb.

Ideally I would like to be able to present the time so I don't have to manually turn the light on or off using the app.

As an avid google fan and long time user of Google Play Store, Music, and Cloud Services, I was expecting the Google Home Mini to surpass the echo as far as content and continuity is concerned. I am not impressed. Drawbacks: -Lack of connectivity with most non-Google products -no remote -although improving frequently, the number of apps is quite minimal, at best POSITIVE FEATURES: - Still playing nicely with You Tube -amazing sound quality for such a tiny speaker. -ability to make hands free calls over Wi-F"

Even if you do not see yourself living in a mega mecca of Smart supplies, it's fun to ask Google so many things and because it has access to everything that is on the regular Google search engine, it is extremely smart!

I do have to say that it is a pretty cool device. It doesn't take up much space and can be placed incognito. Google Home recognizes my voice really well but there are some limitations to what it can do. I'm not able to customize what I call the device so I'm stuck saying Hey Google. There are times where I ask it a question and its not able to find the answer for me. I'm sure with time these things will be worked out with either software updates or a new model.

5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Nice replacement for a little radio.,"Got this as a promotion so couldn't go wrong for the price. Sound isn't as good as it's big brother, but it isn't bad, works well for lower background music, news, etc. If you want to 'jam', get the big brother. We use it in the bathroom for getting ready in the morning, works great because you don't have to touch it so you can place it anywhere, takes up way less space than a radio, and isn't reception sensitive."
5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Good value for money,This small smart speaker with Google assistant is perfect. It can here you from the other side of the house and will answer almost all of your questions. If you don't have special sound requirements then it is also good for listening to some music and is a good value for your money. For about 50$ you get a smart Google assistant speaker. That's a great deal for me. I already have two of them...
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Ok Google Mini,"Read my review of the Google Home. I purchased this device along with two Google Homes. Ended up returning the Google Homes and keeping the Mini. I used this device in my kitchen, where most of the conversations with friends and neighbors happened. This device play ok music, I would like to connect it to a better speaker, but it is ok for now. I like how the google assistant handles the questions. Overall it works well and I would certainly recommend. The only issue I found is that I can't connect to speakers by bluetooth and it also does not have a audio out port on the back (like the Echo Dot)."

Lights and others work fine."

The price is a fraction of the cost as well at $49 each plus tax. The features and performance are superb, but overall the best of all is that it is easy to use."

I would definitely recommend this product.

I found myself sometimes hurrying my shower or going thru the process of drying a hand just so I could skip to the next track track/newscast/podcast/etc. Well not anymore, people. This thing is p great, just tell it what to do and (usually) it gets done. You can even get a bit of an attitude w her and she doesn't even get snarky back at you! It's nice. And if you ask her how her day was she's so positive about being able to help answer all of our questions. She's pretty great. Now I see why 'Her' got the green light."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,The truth,"Well I admit no kidding I made fun of friend who recently got the full sized version. Like what use could that really be. After few days and seeing these on sale for $30 I grabbed one. It is beyond handy to have around , so much so couple days after that I bought one for the bedroom as well. Timers, light control, quick math or conversions. For it's sale price everyone should have one , no joke. I use it several times a day for legit reasons. No gimmicky fun things all real world practical uses. I even after buying my two bought one for a friend."

5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Second one purchased,Love it. Use it pretty often to ask silly questions. Great device to broadcast to family at home while out and about. Use it literally every evening by asking Google to play lullaby music to put my two 15 month twins and plays all night.

I wanted to be able to turn my TV on with my voice and thought for sure this would be compatible. Boy was I wrong. It will not turn on TVs with built in Chromecast. I will turn it on and start playing Youtube videos, but only if you say play cat videos on Youtube on the TV. Not sure why I can't just turn the TV on."
5.0,2 years ago,Currys,Oliver's review of Google Home Mini,"Pros: Excellent piece of kit.Pros-Without Chromecast/SpotifyYou can enjoy podcasts, stream the radio, fun facts, jokes, play a quiz game, pretty much have Wikipedia available to answer all your questions-With Chromecast/SpotifyYou can link to a TV or Stereo system to stream music via bluetooth/wifi. You have all the music you can think of simply by requesting ""Hey Google, Play Wooly Bully, by Sam the Sham and the Pharos""Podcasts, audiobooks, ambient sleep sounds, weather updates. Or like me, you wake up in the dead of the night in the dark, ""Hey Google, what's the time?"" Cons: Not being able to link to a Stereo for better sound without additional purchases of items like ChromeCast."
5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,"Can do a lot, with excellent audio","The Google Home Mini is probably the best positioned to respond to your questions amongst the other AI devices available, except when ordering online, especially from Amazon.

5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Great addition to the household!,"I highly recommend Google Home from Best Buy. It's great for creating atmosphere with whatever music you're in the mood to listen to.

5.0,a year ago,harveynorman.com.au,Nifty little product!,"I bought this for my son for his room and it has been such a great product. He uses it as an alarm - the only alarm that has been able to wake him from his teenage slumber so far, for weather information so he knows it's not going to rain on his bike on the way to or from school, playing music, it's a great source of information while doing assignments and it sits very neatly on his bedside table and matches his decor perfectly. He is very happy with his Google Home and loves to show it off to his friends when they are over :)"
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great way to fill your home with google,"I had a regular size Google Home before and love it. We keep it in our kitchen and use it every day. When the minis came out and went on sale for black friday, I bought 4 of them and put them throughout the house. Now we have google all over and it's very handy. We can use it as an intercom or to play music throughout the house. I will say that the mini audio is not nearly as good as the full size Home, but it's not bad for it's size. I just doesn't have as much low end. Overall, very pleased and I may end up getting a couple more, because I keep finding myself trying to talk to google in rooms where I don't have it!"

My only issue is with smart products in general. For example, if I set an alarm, and want to snooze, I have to speak to it, which will wake up my partner. That is the challenge of only being able to use your voice to control it."

""Hey Google turn up the heat or Hey Google set the temperature to 76"" (if you have a Nest or smart thermostat). If you want to hear some tunes say, ""Hey Google play some Billy Joel, etc."" The speaker is ok. If you buy more than one Google Home Mini then you can broadcast messages to everyone in your house.

Seems I've purchased a couple of really expensive light bulbs; if they're ""smart"", they are far too smart for me to operate."
5.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,I LOVE my Google Home Mini,I now have 2 google home minis in my house and I love to sync them together when listening to music! I can walk around the house and clean without having to drag my phone around with me. It is also so convenient to have something there to answer your questions at all times. I will buy more!
5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Perfect working order,Bought two of these to set up multi room audio across the house. My 3rd home mini in the house. Works perfectly but sound quality isn't perfect. I intend to output these to better speakers in the fullness of time. Cheap way to set up multi room audio and with the added benefit of being home hubs as well.
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Not as good as Alexa,The Google Home Mini is a nice addition to my phone office. I got it free when I purchased another item at Best Buy. I already had an Amazon Echo with Alexa and IMO Alexa is still the front-runner in this game. Alexa is smarter when asking her questions and can be linked with more music services and smart devices. If you are already in the Google Eco-system the Google Home Mini will be a nice addition to your other products but right now cannot beat Alexa. Google will likely get smarter and more useful over time with future updates.
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Great little addition that really helps,I've had a mini for a few years now that I used to play music on and control two smart bulbs but recently got this one and more bulbs. Wow!! Didn't really realize what all these little things could do and help with!!! Color me impressed :)
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Surprisingly good sound,"This thing is small but mighty! Useful assistant, constantly updated by google, and surprisingly good sound for its profile. We have it in the kitchen and it fills the room pretty well when turned up. One difficulty - the up/down volume buttons are touch areas on the side, but invisible, and since it’s a circle, sometimes you can’t tell exactly where they are. Also the whole “google tracking everything do” thing..."
1.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Horrible product,"I have own almost all the Echo devices and decided to give Google a whirl. What a mistake! This product is not easy to set up. It is clunky, could not listen to my directions. I returned it in just a few days. Do yourself a favor and buy an echo."
5.0,a year ago,lowes.com,Google Mini Chalk + GE Smart Bulb,"Very good products in one starter kit. Easily set and use. My son and I played around with it in the beginning to learn how to ask questions properly. It was fun, even asking Google to flip a coin. I like it so much went back and purchased 2 more. One for my bedroom and the other for downstairs family room."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Better than the competition,Google Home Mini is a late entrant compared to echo dot. I had a chance to compare both of them side by side. They are very close in functionality. However google home mini excels in following areas compared to echo dot. 1. Better Speaker 2. Better voice recognition. 3. Better and more relevant search results ( Thanks to google search vs bing provided by Amazon). The only thing I dislike about home mini is the touch buttons on the side. Every time you lift the device it messes the volume or starts playing media. Echo dot does have lot more skills but mini seems to be catching very fast.

As well as controlling your Phillips Hue or Lifx lights whenever you want, this smart assistant is perfect for everyday life at home."
5.0,4 months ago,lowes.com,Great bargain!,"The combo pack is a great way to get you started on connecting your home.

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Awesome voice companion,"We have an Amazon Echo, but we found that we had to give commands in very specific ways to get the results we wanted. That's where the Google Home Minis shine brightly. They always understand, and their speakers are really powerful for such a small device. We really love having this around to play music or sounds or ask for weather or anything else that comes to mind."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Works just as well as Google Home,"The mini is perfect. I bought 8. Couple for myself and the rest for gifts which everyone loved. The volume is more than sufficient for a large room or living area. The range on voice command is good too. I can talk to mine from as far as 20 ft away and it generally hears me unless there are other noises. Best of all, my wife thinks she knows everything. Ah ah! Not anymore. My little google woman is not constantly correcting her. My wife can’t fight a google mini so it’s perfect. And when I have to sleep on the couch at least I have the google mini for tunes or just keep me company."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Google Home,"I ended up returning this product but I do hear great things about the Google Home.

You can ask about directions, how the weather is, etc."

Great product.
4.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Good for home control but needs work as an assistant,"It's good if you're looking for smart home control but as an assistant the Google home mini isn't as ""smart"" as the assistant on Android. There are so many things it can't do unfortunately. Good for streaming music and sound is phenomenal for the size. It does have issues finding music from your library but playback from music services work ok."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Great, But Not as Good as Google Home Hub",I was grateful taking advantage of getting one for free in a combo package for Christmas! I use these things in areas where I don't want to take my Google Home Hub. They are my secondary gadgets. They are great for a bedroom or a loft. They are good for handy information whenever you need it like weather or whatnot. Setup is a snap with your Google Home App.
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Love the Mini,Would not buy the full size when you can buy the mini for half the price. These little minis hold up and have what it takes. The sound quality is close to a full size but if your not blaring and trying to make it a sound system you wont know the difference.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Love it!,"I recommend the google mini to everyone. It's small and can be concealed anywhere but the speaker packs a punch. Being able to work my Phillips hue lights with the speaker as well as Spotify/YouTube is convenient. I love being able to tell Google I'm going to bed and have her ask what time to set the alarm for before she plays an hour of calming sounds. In the morning, I get an alarm, weather update, and review of my calendar."

5.0,3 months ago,John Lewis,Great little gadget,"I bought this for my children really, as they love to get it to play their favourite songs (although you do need to subscribe to a music service for this). Can be annoying when they ask it silly questions all the time, but is generally a good addition to the house. And is quite unobtrusive too which is a bonus."
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great Assistant ! OK hardware !!,The search assistant is really cool and works almost for any query. The integration with Youtube and Chromecast is the best part that stands out from other smart speakers out there. I have a few Echo devices and I found that Google home mini does really better in answering the questions. However the microphone fails in far-field recognition and hearing us while playing music. I found Echo devices being more responsive in this. Overall a really good smart speaker and you won't regret the purchase especially with the special holiday pricing.

I 'asked' the Mini to recite my upcoming calendar events and it only responds with those events that have a set time! It cannot find the 'all day' events! Are you kidding me?? The most powerful software company in the world (sorry Microsoft) and it doesn't 'see' those events on my Google Calendar! My Echo Dot has no problem reciting my Google Calendar events!! I checked the Google Forum and people reported this a year ago!! Holy Smokes, the world is surely ending!"

Google Home now runs the thermostat, most of the lights, all stereos, TV, Audio Receiver, Google Chrome, and even my DirecTV through the Logitech Harmony Hub. It's exceptionally convenient, especially in the kitchen. With my hands full, I can turn lights on and off, change the music, set multiple timers for what I'm doing, add things to the shopping list, and even look up recipes. I'd be lost without it."

Very good voice recognition. I wish it could connect to other bluetooth speakers as the Echo does so I could use one of my existent (and good) speakers with it and also listen to music using voice commands. So far not using it to connect to any other smart item in my home... this one is just to better understand this technology and compare to the Amazon Echo one. Still trying to decide."

Since they are competitors of amazon you can play amazon music like you can from my alexa. That would probably be the only thing I do not like. I like the google assistance and everything you can do. A lot of the things it can do you don't need to go on the app to enable that skill like with the alexa. You do need to add accounts. I have the phillips hue and it works a lot better with it than the alexa dot. You say ""Hey Google turn off the lights"" and it does it with the alexa i find you have to be more specific."

I have to unplug the Mini or I am constantly losing my WiFi connection. Search for the WiFi bug and you'll see an explanation for what I'm talking about.

Then after downloading it the user wants a copy, the user needs to print using their paper, ink, etc. So I have decided that I cannot give more than 2 stars to any product that that has instructions such as plug it in and got to website for complete instructions."
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Surprisingly good sound,I got this for extra tunes in my restroom so I don't have to place my phone in a crazy position for louder music. hahaha This works perfectly. Syncs easily with the other google home I have and plays the same music once assigned to a 'speaker group'.
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Nice Assistant,"I was skeptical of these listening devices doubling as virtual assistants, but once I got one in the house, it quickly became on of my favorite things. Able to set alarms and reminders, as well as quickly tell you weather reports and answer almost anything you can think of. Really impressive."
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Great entry into smart home,Been an Alexa house for awhile but wanted to start adding lights. The google mini is easy to setup and adding the bulbs was very easy. No need for a hub with the mini. I really like the Google Home interface overall as well on my iPhone.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,So Convenient!,"Google home mini can do so many different things. My husband and I use it everyday for so many things. We can turn our lights on and off, set a timer especially in the kitchen. It can tell me if my front door is locked as well as play the music of our choice. My granddaughter can tell it to read her a story. It is nice to know the weather outside."
3.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,More of a novelty than convenience,"Very easy to set up, works fine, the speaker isn't anything to write home about, but I didn't expect high fidelity from it. My wife and I have it on our kitchen counter to listen to podcasts or music while we cook/clean and for that purpose it works fine."

It does cost about 50 dollars but they always go on sale around the holidays and that’s when I got mine. 4/10,So I am a fan of the google mini I think the only thing I do hate about it is if you have your tv on an google ad comes on the mini thinks your talking to it and man it scares me every time .

It’s not compatible with our music, smart home, etc. Reviews were meh. It was going to have a future as a paperweight. It went back. And, since it was a package deal with Tiles, they went back, too. Oh, and salespeople were less-than-helpful."
4.0,a year ago,ebay.com,A privacy nightmare but great!,"This thing is really handy, fun, practical in many ways. Great for turning all those lights, and powering on those plugs by voice alone. But you trade your privacy for it. Everything you say, and search for is stored on Google servers, everything you watch, your location. Everything. And as I understand it, much of your data is sold or shared with third parties."
4.0,9 months ago,ebay.com,Good quality device,"Sound quality is better than i had read in a number of reviews. Plays music, radio, podcasts etc loudly and clearly.

I can't believe how sensitive it is too. I have it in the living room, and if I speak loudly I can talk to it from any room on the main floor within 30 feet. I find it really handy for answering almost any trivia question, but mainly for weather and traffic updates as I'm leaving the house. Just found out I can use it to dial any contact on my phone hands free and use it as a good speaker phone. I'm constantly surprised by what it can do. And this technology will only get better and better!"

5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Best $30 ever spent,"For a technology freak, this is perfect. I have so many things linked to the Mini! Lights, music, weather, and more. It is nice that Google created a smaller version. Mine even recognizes ""Hey Google"" from commercials on TV but doesn't respond to the command since it has learned my voice. My favorite thing is that I paired it with Phillips Hue lights. Imagine the clap-on-clap-off in modern times. Also, you can play games and search the web for information. It even adds things to your shopping list so you can retrieve them on your phone!!!"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Easy to use smart bulb,"Connected to my Google home and worked instantly! If you want to make scenes and routines, I believe you need to set it up with the C by GE app first and then connect it to Google Home.

4.0,2 years ago,thegoodguys.com.au,JAMES's review of Home Mini - Chalk,Pros: Surprising I prefer the sound from the mini to the larger Google Home. Voice detection is excellent as is it's understanding of pretty much everything I say (hey Siri I hope you're listening and learning!!!) I'm very excited that an update has now allowed us to control some functions by tapping/pressing the mini. Mine is in the bathroom while the big guy is in the kitchen. Love it. Cons: The touch sensitivity is not great. I'm not sure if they can fix that. I find myself tapping around it looking for the sweet spot like a chicken pecking grain :)

5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Smartest but not most versatile,"I started my home automation journey with Lutron and control 4! Siri hit the market and seemed cool on paper. I let Amazon Alexa mature through 2 generations & jumped in. I picked up the google mini to supliment the search engine power that Amazon lacks. To control lights, switches, fans, pandora on my home audio I'm with Alexa. When my kids need answers to a questions for school, ""who's smarter than a 5th grader"" style, we all ask google. Great design, ease of use, smart enough to control a house but it's not as ubiquitous as echo."

5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great personal assistant from Google,"It does everything for you with different features always becoming available. We bought a few for each bedroom. I love it for playing music in whatever location you're in the house and telling you about your day just by saying good morning Google. If you're working, cooking, doing homework, etc, and need a question answered, it does it for you. The kids love it and use it ALL the time. It's very amusing when my son uses the broadcast feature to send random affection messages to his mother while in different parts of the house."

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Way better than the Eco Dot,"First off, I have been using the Eco Dot for a while. I mainly use it to listen to podcasts and music while I am working around the house. It is an ok device for listening to music but the speaker is a bit tinny. The Google Home mini speaker is way better. It does not rival the big brother Google Home in terms of sound quality but it has a much richer sounding speaker compared to the Dot... more bass, clearer sound. The Google Home mini mic can have a hard time hearing the hot word if you have the sound up really loud but I am guessing that will be fixed with a software update."

4.0,a year ago,Office Depot,Excellent Helper,"Setup via a smart phone app of Google's Home Mini Speaker is a little annoying (establish a Wi-Fi connection, log into one's Google Account, connect compatible smart devices, etc.). Yet, once setup, Google's assistant is far superior to Alexa and Siri in answering complex questions and even providing additional details for extreme clarification."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Love it,"Great product. My teenagers have it set to turn lights on at a certain time. They can set reminders for their chores and school assignments. My con: as a mother: they set voice recommendation so I can't leave them reminders. They definitely like it more than the other brand-they gave that one to me. Items also arrived in plenty of time for Christmas, shipping was very good."
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,A Major go Buy,I love this combination because you get the google mini with the GE light bulb. The set up is very easy for the Google mini download the Google home app and for GE light bulb put it in the lamp connect it. The GE light bulb is voice control by the Google mini and you can change the light brightness from 1% up to 100%.
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Fantastic deal!,"I got this speaker from Google to add to my home, It does the basic commands like playing music or turn on the lights (Smart Switch required) or check your calendar, email, etc. It seems that with the latest updates more commands can be given to it, but it would be nice if you could have your family members voice added so it will give results depending on who's asking. Some limits and restrictions can be done through the Google Home app, but I wish they would allow some more tweaking for it."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great Home Tool,"This is a great tool for a lot of things. You can use WeMos, you can use SmartThings to turn devices lights and appliances on and off. Great for the holiday to turn your Christmas tree on and off and ask it all kinds of questions, calcultor,, read you stories, ask for grilled cheese recipes, movies at the local theater. Driving directions, the weather today, tomorrow, next week. Set sleep timers listen to music Google Play, Etc. Add items to the grocery list and retrieve it later. Play all kinds of games- multiplayer . This is definitely a must-have for any family."
5.0,a year ago,lowes.com,Awesome deal,"Got this so we could have a Mini in the garage, works great to use as we exit or enter the house. Also useful to send and receive ""broadcast "" while working in the garage. Put the smart bulb in the office where we only need the ceiling fan light occasionally while working at the computer . Now just tell Google turn it on or off. Works great and was easy to setup."
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Overall great product,Received a google home and also a google Home mini for Christmas. I love them both. It is very accurate in listening to commands and very precise. The only thing I can say since I own both is that I am able to hear a noticeable difference in sound quality. The google Home is much louder and an overall better quality speaker. I still would recommend the mini because the price is more than half of the regular. I am planning on adding more to the other rooms. Great for yourself and to gift others!
2.0,a year ago,walmart.com,The app needs some tweaking.,I have both Alexia and Google Home Mini. Immediately I was sorry I purchased the G.H.M. The app is not as user friendly as the Amazon app. I am no tech genius but ease of the first time use with Alexia was superior to GHM. I was interrupted during the initial setup and have not yet been able to get back to where I was or find from the app what I was trying to do. As of now I just want to uninstall it and send it back or sell it on Ebay. Sadly I purchased two.

Then Google home is way better than the Amazon Echo (Alexa) if you want an unbiased search of local businesses.

Google Home uses Google search and can find any local small business, not just ones that signed up at Yelp!."

If you have a regular Google Home unit you will be disappointed in the audio quality of this unit. Tap to stop playback no longer works - apparently Google disabled this due to some unexpected issues - so you must use voice control. Volume up/down by tapping on the side still works. There is no AUX output, so if you need that look for the product from the competition."

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,"Nice,compact info center",I had another brand device like this and it died on me. So I was walking around the store and came across this Google Mini. It was on Black Friday super sale so I picked one up. Set up was very easy after I downloaded the Google Home app to my phone. You say a few phrases so it learns to recognize your voice and you're set. I put this on my nightstand so I can ask it what the weather is like and whats on my calendar for the day. It does a ton of stuff and I'm still learning. But so far I'm pretty impressed by it. The bigger version is probably the one you want if you want to listen to music. The mini sounds ok for what I want it for. If they're still on sale I'm going to pick up a few more.

5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Very good device,This is my third smart speaker and I think I need another. It is a very good product. I can ask anything to google and I get a very good answer. Just with a command “hey google: turn the light on blue” and the speaker does it right away. I am very happy with them.
5.0,a year ago,staples.com,I love this device.,"My son bought me the same device as a Christmas present. After having it in my bedroom for a short while, I loved it so much that I bought a second one for my kitchen. I love playing music, finding out the weather, setting timers, locating my misplaced cell phone, and other things all with just a simple voice command. I highly recommend this item."
1.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Seriously horrible,"Google has had some serious cloud issues with their Google Home, and Home Mini for the past few months making the Google home or mini one of the worst experiences I've ever had. Constantly losing my voice data, so it couldn't give me my schedule, shopping lists, etc., making this virtually a useless home assistant."
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"OK Assistant, Still needs work","Ive had google and alexa. This one's ok, but still seems to need some work. We have multiple ones in our home, and they don't seem very ""Smart"" about which one we're closest to listening and knowing what to do. You have to be very, very specific about what you want, so some commands become very long. Most devices it works with seem to be more expensive than those that work with amazon."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Its okay..Amazon alexa is better,"I like Amazon Echo dot over this. Same price but this device is little weird. I find it hard to use over google home app. Its very confusing and UI of app is also not friendly. Also, I don't see the glowing ring on the side when I say ""hey google"" so it makes me wonder if its activated or not when I speak far across the room. Also, my chromecast was acting weird while asking to pay videos on my TV. Pros: Cheap, looks good, good sound, need to say two word to awake it (unlike amazon's device where you can just say ""Alexa"") Cons: Amazon is more developed and responsive. Great skills on Amazon"

I bought my first one a couple of months ago and picked up 2 more to have in several rooms. The best part is I can link them all together to play music around my whole home. The Assistant is quite convenient and always there to ask just about anything, even a joke."

I had no intentions of buying this but got it free with the purchase of some tile mates at Christmas time.

The volume is a little loud - maybe I don't know how to set it so that it's the same volume I selected the first time. Google is getting better. With Alexa and Google in the same house - Google is distinctively superior.

5.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Great bedside companion,Got this for my wife who hated getting comfortable in the bed then having to get up to turn off the light. Now she can simply ask Google to turn off the light. Worth the money just for that and the LED upgrade really enjoy all the other features.
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great little smart box,"I was not sure I wanted ()or needed this), but it was so inexpensive, I tried it. The setup was really easy and the assistant works very well. There are always new things I learn it can do and use it more each day. Very convent to say ""Ok Google set a timer for 5 minutes"" without lifting a hand. Also, it works great with the Nest thermostat too. Keep in mind that this is not a bluetooth speaker, even though it plays music, the sound quality for music is not great. They make better models for that and that is not what this is designed for."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Size doesn't matter,"Obviously smaller than the Google Home. The only difference is the sound quality. The other has better bass, providing a much richer and fuller sound.

5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Very useful!,I enjoy communicating with my son downstairs instead of having to go down just to say dinner's ready. I also love playing music through it. It is loud enough to hear in the next room and I can also ask it to do something from another room. Great price too!
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Solid little device,"With Google's software this unit is on par with their initial Google Home device which is over twice as much as the mini. If you're picky about your music and listen to a lot, then you'll want to get the Original Google Home or the Google Home Max. However, if your music isn't heavy on the bass, or you don't mind hearing less of it, then this device is just as good as the more expensive option. I listen to a lot of news and podcasts, so it works great. Also, now that I've paired this device with a few chromecast audios on existing speakers, the Original Google Home isn't really needed anymore."
4.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Good - but not great,This is the basic smart speaker. I suggest you spend the additional money to get the version with a video screen. I have to get over the fact that Google can listen to everything I say when I'm around the device. Just know this before you purchase one.

Now that's something I do understand .. I've lived with push advertising all my long life! The good thing about google .. It's subtle! The advertising is not exactly in your face!

2.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Fails in a major way,"My expectation was that this device would play music that I have uploaded to Google Play Music. I can play all of the uploaded music from any Android phone. But Google requires a subscription to play even the uploaded music. For reasons that tech support can't explain, I can tell the mini to play some of my uploaded songs, but not most. (The choices seem random.) It seems ridiculous that Google encourages people to upload up to 50,000 songs to its service, and then won't allow those songs to be played by its devices. It's a shame because the device is useful in other ways."

We wake up in the morning with an alarm set by it, we ask about the weather, put on the radio and even ask it to tell us a joke. During the day we ask it to put the volume up or down, depending if we like the song on the radio. We also ask it to sing Happy Birthday to one of our friends who was not aware of its existence. We used it to cook various recipes and it was so easy the way it took us step by step through all the ingredients and way of making the food. We can't see our life without it and we truly consider it as a very helpful family member. It even has a name: GooGoo."

Very easy to install and use. Review: I think that what I love the most about the Google Home Mini is that it is as good as you are creative. you can find so many things you can use it for and with, all you have to do is be creative. And there are many peripherals to the Google Home Mini that makes it even better. You don't NEED it, but its great to have it :)"

5.0,2 years ago,walmart.com,Excellent device for $5 Bucks!!!!,This is my first time buying a personal assistant and I must say that I'm glad I did. I was not sure if I would use it enough to make it worth the money but then google decided to mark them down to 30 bucks. I'd say that if you listen to music even just on occasion it's worth the money. Plus if you link your Walmart and google accounts together you get a $25 dollar credit to spend on google express so that makes this device just $5 bucks. I bought one for me and my brother and can say that's it's been worth it and linking your accounts for the credit is easy. I'd say try it for yourself and just see if it's for you and if you hate it Walmart makes returns easy you have 15 days to return it.

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,"Nice tool, room for improvement","The Google home mini is a great addition to my apartment. I enjoy asking it about my day, which prompts it to read off the weather, any reminders I might have set, and then some news. It's nice for general Googling and controlling smart home IoT devices. However, it's far from perfect. It's more of a novelty than a truly revolutionary smart home tool. Still, for the price, it's worth buying. After all, it gets smarter with each update, and I look forward to what tricks Google will teach the home mini in the future."

Cons: Has awoken my father on a few nights saying ""it's having a bit of trouble"", it would be preferable if google did not initiate an existential crisis in the early hours of the morning, its far too human.

The answers to general questions have been more reliable (I.e., it didn't add diapers to my shopping cart when I asked who the 14th President was like my Echo did). And it seems to understand a lot more ""human speak"" like ""Play Metallica in the Living Room for 20 minutes"". Overall, I'm very happy considering the low cost and ease of use."

But if I ask a general question like ""tell me the show times at xyz theater"" it will only give me the next showtimes and not all the show times. The Echo gives all the show times. I still have not had it long but I couldn't figure out how to get it to give me all the show times for a particular movie for a particular theater. This seems essential in using this kind of assistant. Since this is just a software issue I am hoping it improves.

We love our Google home but so far have had a lot of trouble with playing music through Spotify. (Not sure who’s at fault) Songs pause (buffer) constantly which makes it very annoying when trying to listen to music. Our google home is only 10 ft away from our couch and in a silent room it cannot hear me when speaking in a normal tone. We have to yell. So far we have plugged our Alexa back in to play music through. Hoping either Spotify or google resolve this issue.

Even found some home brew js and php apps to further it's usefulness. I went back a few days later and bought two more for and a few for the family.

I have Alexa in the same room, and right after she tells me she doesn't know, I'll ask Google the same one, and get an answer. And the answers from Google are more in-depth.

It can control Philip's hue lights but it has no concept of scenes so you have to spend two minutes describing each bulb setting. Better to tick a Philips remote dimmer nearby and press a button. After 4 days on tech support they decided that you can't ask it to locate or call your iPhone. Works OK streaming music for such a small box.

3.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Good but needs to learn a lot more,"Google mini is just like having your Android phone. It is good but needs to improve a lot to before it can compete with Alexa. Some of its feature rely on connection to linked phone or tablet. It also is not able to hold conversation naturally. Every time the phrase “Hi Google, or OK Google” needs to be repeated even when the conversation is still on going. For example, when making a shopping list the attention getting phrase must be repeated before adding an item to the list. Additionally, when the music is loud you must yell to get its attention."

This on the other hand takes one gmail account and ability to yes to a couple of permissions and your done. Google answers real life question w/o the hassel of trying to figure out how to phrase the question to get the answer you want. I links to everything right from the start. Until these came out I had left a couple of phones on in various rooms to get the same effect. These just are better to look at and only answere when asked."

Home mini works great and the AI is very intuitive. In afew cases better than my Alexa 1gen. I paired it with a chromecast that I also got from here and worked fantastic. Also gives me the ability to turn on my tv which is cool. 2 main problems. Sound is not great. But for the price and size. That’s ok. In relation to the first problem. There’s no aux port. Like 2gen echo products. Bummer but that’s ok. Overall a must have for a smart home.

The Google many works perfectly and I bought it as a gift. I still have the 2nd one waiting to give it to someone or maybe I'll use it at work as a prize to win.
5.0,a year ago,Target,Way worth the price!,I got this in the black Friday deal for $25. My husband and I both have the Google phones so I figured why not the mini Google speaker instead of another brand. This little device is amazing! The quality of sound for music is perfect. Super simple to use and navigate through plus you can use non Google apps with it.
4.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Great Overall Product,Pros Great overall product Very easy to setup The Sound is pretty good for a small speaker Cons We need more integration features with Xbox One and other devices. We need more features overall like broadcast to an individual device vs all devices.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Such a useful product,"Google home mini was the perfect purchase for a studio apartment. We'll use it a lot more than we anticipated, I really like the routine for the morning that I used to listen to podcasts that I am interested in. If you don't already have a Google home mini it would be a nice addition to your home. We love it, it pairs nice with our other Google products."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Love the Mini,I love the mini. The sound is not quite what a full Google home is but for the price I started buying these instead of the actual full size home. I own 6 minis and 1 full size and honestly i would buy a mini over a full size because price is not worth the larger one.

5.0,3 weeks ago,Best Buy,Great way to easy into new technology!,"I bought this purely because they were offering a bundle deal with the Google chromecast. I had no idea I would use it as often as I do. The music sounds good, it helps keep me up to date with the weather and my schedule, but best of all, it connects to my tv so I am almost completely hands free in the home!"
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Definitely worth the price,"Of course, the only products that are getting cheaper by the day are the electronic products. More than my urge to explore its capabilities, I wanted to buy this for my kids. It certainly worked well. My 6 and 11 year-old are having good time asking questions, listening to various sounds, and listening to the stories during their bed time. Especially, the stories are not just one, or two-liners, but of decent length, and at times the kids slip into sleep by the end of it. It receives your voice commands better than your best half does it to you ;)"
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,"""Amazing product. Tiny but so useful and fun!""","I love my Google home minis. I have 3 of them, 2 in kids rooms. The feature is 'broadcast - come to kitchen for dinner' and it announces to all the devices!! Speaker quality is good for such a small size."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,We use these everday in our home,"I have one in each room for a total of 4 Google home mini's. We use them to turn on and off our Lifx smart bulbs light. The kids have them in their room for listening to music and using them as alarm clocks for school, and timers. Search recipes in the kitchen, ask it history questions, play trivia games. Broadcast messages to other Google Home Minis in other rooms like ""Dinner is ready"". Overall a very useful product that does not cost a fortune. Sounds better than the Amazon Dot."
5.0,a year ago,homedepot.ca,Awesome - love it!!,"I bought one for living and kitchen and used it for scheduling, shopping list, timer, weather, recipes, etc. and loved it so much that I bought a second one for my bedroom to control the Philips hue bulbs, set alarm, listen to music, morning news, etc. It doesn't do some features as it does in the states. But I love this little gadget!!! Even though I'm not a techy person, once set up is easy to use!!"
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,More Useful than you Would Expect,This thing is awesome!! I just ask it to do random things just to see if it can and most times it can!! I use it to play my shows on the TV. Turn my TV and lights off for the night. Raise the volume of my shows. Fast forward and rewind my shows. Step by step recipes. I love it so much I got 3 of them!! And now we use them as intercoms!!! We play games on it as family. Music is always playing softly because of how easy it is. People come over and are amazed by it and sometimes even purchase one online while they are still visiting. Highly recommend. Makes great gifts. I gave 6 away and everyone loves me for it.
3.0,a month ago,influenster.com,It’s okay. The price was right when I got this but I don’t think it’s anything special. It sits in my room unused because I mostly forget it’s there.

5.0,a year ago,Target,Impressive Performance,"We have been using Amazon smart home products for a few years but if we ever have the opportunity, I would absolutely switch over to Google. It responds more quickly and more accurately to our commands and hasn't accidentally been set off by the TV at all in the three weeks we've had it out (vs the 10 times Alexa has). I definitely prefer its performance, though aesthetically it isn't quite as appealing as the echo dot."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Easy to set up & improves over time,We got a Google Home a year ago and we were pretty disappointed in how little it understood and could respond. Just a year later it is completely different. Google Home understands 80% of what we ask and can tell diffferent voices apart. The app also continues to improve and add more features. We decided to add the mini to reach into another room and the mini is just as great. You do have to use your voice to turn off sound on the mini rather than tapping like the Google Home. Overall I love it and can't wait to see where it's at in another year.
4.0,4 weeks ago,influenster.com,We got this for free with our spotify account. It has been very nice. My husband especially likes it and will talk to it more than I do.

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,"Hey google, why are you better than Alexa?","I bought both a Google home mini and a Echo Dot to try them out to see which I liked better. I ended up returning the Echo within a day sticking with the Google. The mini does pretty much everything the Echo can but also has the power of Google search. I also preferred the Google AI voice over the Alexas. I think for the average user like me, the mini is the way to go."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,convenient if you have smart stuff,"Got this as part of a package with a Nest Doorbell. I already have a Pixel 2 phone and it's pretty much an extension of the google assistant. I can turn on any of my smart devices and if someone's in face recognition with the nest, it tells me they're at the door with their name. It does confuse my phone when I want to make a phone call through a voice command but otherwise, it's great."
5.0,a year ago,Target,Convenient and amusing,"Really enjoy the convenience of just asking google to look things up for me. I can check the weather, my schedule, commute times and play/change music all while completing other chores, never once having to stop, type, look at a screen, etc. It's just make things a bit easier. The mini also has little games you can play such as trivia, genie, madlibs, others and tell stories too."

But yeah"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Handy and Amusing,"This little speaker can do lots. It can play music, control your tv, play games and turn off your lights. There are 2 of the mini devices in the house now so they can be used as an intercom. Once we had one we were hooked. All our devices are Android and email is gmail, this just made more sense than an Echo for us. We would be lost without them now."

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,"Great if you have other ""smart"" products","The Google Home mini does everything it says it does, although some features don't function as well as others. It can't read multiple calendars if you have them set up which is unfortunate. The speakers are surprisingly loud. Would use this to replace my Bluetooth speaker but unfortunately it isn't portable and has to be plugged it at all times. Setting timers and reminders is quick and easy. Unfortunately I don't have any other ""smart"" home products so I wasn't able to use this to its full potential."
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Can't stop loving Google mini,"Google mini is around awesome. This list of things I can do some example are: I can play music on it, I can make phone calls, control my smart home television display with my voice, I can control all my smart home lights with it, I use it as my alarm clock, I ask it about the daily weather every day, I can set reminders, I can add appointments to my Google calendar, you can teach Google how to talk to you, and lists goes on."
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,"Akin to Amazon Echo, but supports Google devices","Works as expected. It's akin to Amazon Echo in functionality. The major difference (other than aesthetics) is the programs it supports vs. Amazon's Echo. Personally, I am a fan and subscriber of 'Google Music', which Amazon Echo doesn't support. Naturally, Google Home DOES support it. Ultimately, just look at which apps each device will support and buy the hub that will be more compatible with your other devices. Otherwise, I've found it no better or worse than Amazon Echo."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Such a great gift,"I got this as a gift for my gf and it’s just so Convenient. The smart bulb that’s included has been a life saver. You can also link it with your Roku, tell google to turn the Roku on and off. If you have a Roku tv it can do even more, like adjust the volume and mute."
4.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,Good hardward but software needs work,"The item itself is very nice, responds well, and blends in without being intrusive. The software however has some flaws, such is not properly working with some Android TVs and when using reminders it only states that there is a reminder not what the reminder is."
5.0,2 months ago,monoprice.com,I gave up,"I was very resistant to having this type of device in the house, but apparently once you start, you cannot stop.

5.0,a year ago,walmart.com,Great little Google donut Minis,I was hesitating about buying these because I have a phone and the tablet with Google on it. However you can talk to these without picking up your phone or your tablet. I put one in the bedroom and one in the living room and I really enjoy them. Still learning how to do different things with them but so far I really love them.

4.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Very useful and well made.,"Already had a Google Home and so was familiar with the function of Home devices. It's a very impressive little package with reasonable sound for the size and price. Paired up to a Bluetooth speaker but results were a stuttering effect but Google hopefully can sort those issues out. All up, very useful little package and would strongly recommend."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Works great. Prefer Google home then the Echo,This was a great purchase as an alarm and speaker for the bed room. No need to turn my desktop on for music anymore since it can connect to spotify. Im not very tech savvy so connecting it was a breeze. Downside is that the wifi connection on it isnt the greatest so it disconnects sometimes.
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Excellent,"I use my Google Mini 24/7 to listen to music and at night I have Sleep Sounds. It helps block out traffic noise and I have a restless night of sleep. It also turns on my Phillip Hue lights, excellent for setting alarms, reminders & getting news plus so much more."

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Fun to play around with.,"Is it worth the retail price of $49. Probably. Is it worth the $29 holiday season sale price. Definitely. My son and I have spent countless hours playing the embedded trivia games that Google assistant allows. Overall it's great little device---so much that we now have three of them. The Google home effectively turns on the lights, plays our respective Spotify Playlists, entertains us to no end and finds answers to our many asanine world inquiries. What's not to love for $30?"
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Perfect for a bedroom or office.,I didn't expect to get as good a sound as it gives given all the other reviews I have read and considering the size. I am no audiophile so the sound that this little thing kicks out was well beyond my expectations. It fills the room easily and then some with acceptable bass and treble levels. It definitely sounds a lot better than a phone. I would say it is on par with a good Bluetooth speaker. I didn't care for the touch activation because I feel it negates the point of having a voice assistant. Highly recommended.
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,GH Mini = SAME Experience as Google Home!,"Wasn't sure what to expect with the Google Home Mini, however, I only needed one more Google Assistant/Chromecast-able device in our basement (to complement the three other Google Homes in our house) and thought I'd try the GH Mini. It exceeded my expectations...in that it's the SAME experience that you get on the regular Google Home, in a smaller, and (arguably) more stylish package. Even though it's smaller, the sound quality on this puck-ish smart speaker is admirable. Highly recommended, especially if you don't want to commit to the higher cost of the Google Home, but want to get your feet wet in these smart speaker waters..."

However, this device can do everything - I keep finding new ways to use this everyday from a breakdown of my daily schedule, weather updates, news updates, cooking timers, recipe/measurement help, random questions, casting music throughout my home, and broadcasting communications to my family.. just as some examples. Love the unlimited possibilities available and how Google is constantly adding new features! I caught the smart home bug & love it! :)"

The device understands voice commands very well, and answers questions correctly. However, beyond checking the weather or playing music, we still haven’t found much use for it. I’m hoping that as we add other home automation devices, this device can control them, so for example, we can turn on lights by voice command. The only aspect that is not very easy to use is the volume control. Finding the exact spots to press is not that easy."

Not sure we are ready to start adding smart devices so we opted with Google over Echo for the superior Google AI. The mini does what we need it to do - searches, spelling assistant, weather checks, alarm setting. The speaker sound is crisp and loud and microphone quite sensitive. We keep the Google Home mini below our TV and so far have only had a couple of glitches where it attempted to search for something it failed to find, we were startled when it announced it was not able to help with that yet. :-)"

There are a lot of really fun little things that these can do, and a lot of things they can't yet do, but we're hoping. As with any voice activated anything, there's a fair amount of frustration with timing and situations where it just doesn't seem to be listening to you, but overall we're pretty satisfied with our purchase."

The one time it had the correct answers but was answering too quickly for me to right them down, I could not get it to repeat those answers, which were relevant, but instead gave different answers that were completely irrelevant.

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Good smart speaker,"I was really excited to receive this after hearing so much about it. As reviewed by many, the speaker sounds a bit better than the Echo (by Amazon). It also seems a little more 'intelligent', more natural in the way it answers you questions. Of course, it uses Google to find the answers for you (vs. Bing for Echo). However, I was disappointed that it doesn't offer connection via Bluetooth to another speaker. I know the Alexa can do that. And it doesn't have output connections either to attach another (better/larger) speaker."
3.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Still getting it linked/setup,"The device is not as intuitive to set up as other electronics. I usually do not struggle with these things, but I have yet to be able to figure out a few features and there are very few helpful online reviews. I am able to link other programs such as Spotify, Pandora, etc, however after linking the proper tabs such as “music” do not show up where they seem like they are suppose to. Every time I ask it to play a song it tells me I need to choose a default music player, but the “music” tab that I need to go to (as listed in the instructions and online) does not exist within the app on my phone. I am sure it’ll be nice once I have it working properly, but at this time it’s a bit annoying!"
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Bang for the buck,It was a good product as is but totally paid off to buy it on black friday. I have the Alexa and the google home mini. I have been using the Alexa to control my smart home but now with mini it extends my smart home capabilities. I personally found that the wemo devices reacted better when commanded through the Alexa. But the chromecast integration is neat and the commands on mini are more conversational. You can ask a follow up question on the mini and it will know the context based on the previous question asked.

5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,"Does better and more than expected, with promise","The Google Home mini does more and better than I expected. But there are still things you'd expect it to understand that it doesn't. Google is saying that it will get smarter and more features over time. Sound is good for its size and price, but its small and cheap. It worked well setup near the couch with a Chromecast Audio across the room connected to a standard television soundbar. There are some creepy privacy concerns about the big G listening all the time that I don't dismiss, but I'm still in for using one."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Amazing product at a great price,We love the Google home mini! We already had several larger Google home devices but the mini is perfect for the kids' bedrooms. They live it and it saves me from hearing then talking to the one in the living all day. My boys Emily letting it read stories to them and explain science to them. My girls enjoy listening to music. The best party is the broadcast feature to tell them all when it is time for dinner or time to leave... No more yelling to be heard across the house and in bedrooms when their doors are closed!
3.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Neat smart speaker.,"This is my first time owning and purchasing a smart speaker I chose the Google home mini on Black Friday I was in the Greenville, SC location. Lines were not bad and very friendly staff during such a busy day. Anywho, back to the speaker I must say it's rather neat. Set up wasn't to hard just log in to your Google home account and connect to Wi-Fi is easy as Pi. Google home plays music, tells jokes, sets reminders, alarms and even will add things to a shopping list for me all by saying ""Hey Google"" Pros: Price Great starter smart speaker Size and looks Cons: speaker could be more powerful Overall, I like the little thing and happy with my purchase."
3.0,a month ago,Bed Bath & Beyond,Thought this would be fun...NOT,We were so excited to get this. I’m so disappointed in it. It does not follow commands. Even after he repeats back what I said. Most of the trouble is with pandora. Hopefully this is just mine because I’d like to exchange it and see.
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,I love my Google Home Mini(s),"Have added several of these to my home since black Friday and have connected numerous Smart Plugs to the overall system. I am well on my way to have a SMART HOME. Adding new Google Home minis to my existing system was quick and easy. Just a few minutes on each and they were connected and functioning. The only issue I have had with them is each one of the three have dropped off the system once - maybe it was an update, maybe just a network glitch. But I just had to unplug them and plug them back in and all is well. Glad I bought these - and am even giving a few as Christmas presents this year."
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Great device,I love Google Mini (as much as my Echo Dots). They connected to all my devices that Echo Dots were able to and quite impressed with quick response to turn on/off commands. It's also able to understand in languages other than just English so that's a huge plus!
4.0,2 months ago,walmart.com,Good deal,Ita a great value for what you get. I do notice the mini doesn't understand alot of useful functions though (just continues to tell me the team is working on that) and I thought the light would be multicolored but it's just dimmable. For 29$ for both items it is still a good deal.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Nice add on for Google Home households,Picked this up to add as a supplemental component to my existing Google tech. We have Google WiFi and an OG Google Home so this was the perfect add on for an additional way to interface with our system from adjacent room. The wife doesn't know it yet but she'll be finding one of these for her night stand in a nearby stocking very very soon. = ]
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Better than expected,"After using a Google Home Mini for a month, I found it as functional as an Amazon Echo, but for a much more palatable price. Wished there was better G Suite integration (like seeing your calendar for the day), but there's plenty that works. Regular Gmail users (that's you, probably) won't have any missing features. Does the Mini sound good? Not as good as a full Echo, and won't impress audiophiles, but it sure sounds better than most notebook speakers. I use it to play music in a small room and it's fine."

4.0,a year ago,Target,Works great this far,"Nice appearance, easy set up, I wish the light bulb was brighter when on brightest setting but like the voice dimming option, I use it to play music very easily, I like that it keeps listening after an interaction to ask another question, you don't have to say ok google again you can just ask another question. So far so good. Directions say the mini needs to be in the same room as the bulb, I have not tried a different room but that would be nice.I also have an echo dot but I like google a bit more"
5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Great Helper / Assistant,"I have one, and love it ! My Aunt saw it, and liked it, so I purchased one for her.

She likes that you can ask it anything, and it has knowledge from the internet. Feels like a person is with you all day, and my Aunt is a senior citizen who loves talking to it. Lol. Thank you."

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,hot buy but...,"this device is amazing beginning to the automated house craze... I have also begun scoping out smart bulbs and plugs cause of this purchase. However, this def needs to have an aux port or a dual speaker system for my room that this system would totally rock with. but without it, i love listening to the news and my pandora and google music on this. it even got me into free Spotify cause of this. but this def needs to be joint with either I heart radio other radio apps.

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,A great start,"I have some echos as well and find this to not only look better but to recognize regular speech better than the echos. There are also WAY less instances where it thinks it hears its wake word and proceeds to talk. This happened in the echo where I was watching a movie and there was nothing remotely sounding like Alexa or gun, but it chimes in and said “I’ve added a gun to your amazon wish list”. WTH indeed. This still has a way to go but overall is a much better start than the echo has been. Sometimes it’s answer is too in depth and will explain for a minute when a short answer will work."

5.0,2 years ago,John Lewis,I nearly didn’t Buy it!!,"For me this was a choice between Amazon echo and a Google mini. They all do the basic similarities like control heating, lighting land so on. To me the the google mini looks better and has more options with base colours than the echo. If you are a prime member and use memebership fully than the amazon echo is for you. I am a prime member but don’t use it enough to stay loyal to Amazon. The main selling point for me, was that if you train the google mini to recognise household member voices it will give personalised responses. Like from your calendar and so on."
3.0,a year ago,walmart.com,Almost perfect,"Bulb set up was easy, but they are Bluetooth not WiFi so the bulbs must be in the same room as the google home mini. The bulbs are damp rated so the distance restrictions are a little disappointing and that is wat gets this a 3 star. Other than that the bulbs are as bright as any other 60 watt led and can be dimmed from 1% to 100%. Not sure what the normal price is but for the $21 I paid for it, it’s a great buy."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,so fun and helpful,"above my expectations, this is fun and helpful. this is good if you leave it in 1 home on 1 wifi for google, please make portable (not limit to 1 room, battery like a bluetooth speaker) also make easier to take to another house (trying to find wifi or resetting it is a pain, this would be good for you too as it will be free advertisement within families)"

5.0,2 years ago,bestbuy.ca,"Meh,","All it's for is asking about the weather and as a Bluetooth speaker. Also unbelievable how 2018 is a few days away, and here I am with a google product(that is basically just a Bluetooth speaker) that isn't wireless. The features are half baked, as asking it will only lead to it saying ""I could not find it"",""I don't understand"", or just straight up search/give you something entirely different. Overall, nothing more than a blue tooth speaker. that is a cool party trick that tells jokes or the weather. Disappointed with the inconsistency of the features"
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Good for the in-laws,"I have elderly in-laws who are gradually getting more comfortable with technology. They recently got smartphones, but don't fully use them yet. I got the home mini for them as an easy way to introduce the Google Assistant into their lives. They like that they can get the weather and the weather forecast, plus information about different topics just by asking. Unfortunately, these devices are somewhat limited, and you don't always get the information you want. Anyway, it's a start, it's cheap, and it works pretty well for their needs."
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,like the look,The Google Home Mini is the size of a donut and is really a speaker with smart capabilities when set up with your home Wi-Fi network. It has a microphone on/off switch and a USB cord output that connects to a power plug because it needs to be powered from a wall outlet.
2.0,2 years ago,ebay.com,Google Home Mini,"It doesn't have as many qualities as they make out. Bought it as a present for my mother and it's terrible doesn't know a lot and doesn't even connect to iTunes music you have to have spotify or google play music which is ridiculous,was not worth the money at all and will be returning to the manufactures! Such a waste of money that could of gone on something else. Do not like it how you also have to say ""Hey google"" and you cannot just say ""Google"" and you can't even finish off the rest of your sentence you just have to keep saying ""Hey google"" to finish what you was saying previously. Will not be buying another one anytime soon that's for sure."
5.0,5 months ago,ebay.com,Great mini smart speaker,"The Google Mini is perfect for small spaces. I like the fabrics they offer as opposed to the hard plastics of other mini speakers. Sound quality is good for as little as it is, and it can put out some volume."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Excellent home assistant,"I'm very pleased with my Google Home Mini purchase. In fact, I have two of them. I have them paired with my Chromecast Audio so I can play the same music throughout the whole house. I also will use my Google Home Mini to give me news briefings when I get home from work. Plus, I will use Google Home Mini to control my Chromecast, turn my TV on or off, change my Nest thermostat temperature (or tell me what it is currently is set to), as well as play my Nest cameras on my television. The Google Assistant also is friendly and tells jokes. If you want to have fun, just say ""I'm feeling lucky"""
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Good addition,"I've been using an Amazon Echo Dot for the past 4 months and I think when compared to the Google Home Mini, each device has its own pros and cons. The speaker on this unit definitely sounds a lot louder. Ideal to use in a small room. Its also great if you have a Google Play Music or Youtube Music/Red subscription. I use it primarily to play music/sounds when going to bed, setting alarms/reminders, and controlling my smart home enabled gadgets. At this price it will be a great gift idea for the holidays."

I used to buy electronics at Walmart mainly due to its great care plan services but after this experience I am not going back to Walmart for electronics... Just try to access your customer care plan to see what I am talking about. After buying online they keep asking you questions after providing the order number. Really? don't you have all you need already? You are just trying to discourage claims... BAD POCILY WALMART !
3.0,7 months ago,Best Buy,"Excellent, wish they would fix mic/software issue!",Overall happy with our Google homes (added this as our 5th one) but really really wish Google would address and fix the issue of not waking up to command words.

3.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,"Not excited, sorry I bought it.","So far I am not excited about this product. I say ""hey google, what's the temperature"" or ""play music"" and occasionally pull up a recipe. It's constantly saying ""I can't do this at this time, but I am always learning"". I feel like I spent a lot of money for nothing so far. I probably am too late to exchange it for amazon but I'm going to try! Also it does not turn on my android tvs like it says it can. oh well. If these are to be good along with the tower I also purchased and feel the same way about, I guess you need to invest in a lot of money buying the extras. I think google pulled this out of the hat too soon."
5.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Great combo,"I've bought this combo a few times. This is priced right, but is a great deal when on sale. Both the Google mini GE bulb are easy to set up. The bulb itself is a bit finicky at times. The process to do a hard reset is annoying but doable."

When Google talks to you, she is pretty decent, sharp, & clear enough to hear. I set up an alarm for 7:30 AM, & the alarm was loud enough for me to wake up. The ""Tell me about my day"" is great, covers everything I need to know like weather, global news, & the time. Btw, this is my very FIRST smart speaker, & I gotta say it was a great purchase!"

A very ""Helpful"" unit, what one would expect for an at home voice assistant. This is probably one of the best purchases we made in the last 5 years. It's small, fits anywhere.

I am a huge Google fan, so I really wanted to love my Google Home Mini, but not being able to add my SiriusXM account, really put my Amazon Echo back on the shelf and the Google Home is going to my daughter. If they eventually add SiriusXM account link, that will definitely change my rating to a 5, and I'll want it back on my shelf."

Cons: Google Home still feels like work in progress, although to be fair this is not unique to Google, its the same with all the same type of products. The reason I say this is that you still don't feel like to can speak naturally to these things and you can not chain your commands together...eg ""set a time for 5 minutes and then turn the living room light on"".But all that said, I am very happy with my purchase."

If you ask google home a question, it will answer it versus the others who direct you where to find it.

You have to buy a google chrome cast to plug into the stereo then pair with phone in order to and play the music.

You can use it as a speaker for music but you can't play audio from a YouTube video on it. Gives continuous lengthy explanations of it's many limitations. This is not a finished product.

The only issue with that is I can't adjust the source volume from the Home mini. I've still got some things to explore for this device, but I love being lazy so I'll figure it out in time.

5.0,2 years ago,John Lewis,Game Changer!,"Fantastic product. I love that you can talk normally to it and not learn 'keywords' to give commands. It is small and neat and blends in in the living room and not so in your face like the larger more expensive versions. The speakers are not great but adequate. Good enough for radio play which I can now just say. 'Hey Google, play Heart FM'. Kids use it to help with homework, vocabulary learning, etc. Love it! I'll be getting the smart plugs so I can make the most of it."
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,It is a small smart speaker,I say hi/hey google and a command. It does the command. I have several of these around the house that basically function as a whole house speaker system. I can listen to news or music in every room without changing anything.

Before this, all of them used to fight over tablet and smartphones as soon as they come back from school. Since the time we have bought Google home mini, the scene has changed. Now they all play GK games with google, ask it to play their favorite songs, setup reminders for their completion of screen time and lots of other things. I am not sure how long will this small smart gadget keep them occupied but for now I am very happy as I don't get to hear their fight over tablet and phones."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Smart home,Nice combo that contains Google Home Mini and the GE C-Life smart light bulb that perfectly added to my smart home setting. Put them in my home office and now I don't need to stand up or even reach my phone to control lots of things. Broadcast is one of the function my wife loves very much so she doesn't need to text or yell when dinner is ready. Priceless ;)
5.0,2 years ago,John Lewis,Handy little device,"We'd been after a speaker for our kitchen for quite some time. Having already got Sonos in other rooms this seemed like the obvious choice however I was put off at the size, which seemed too big for the kitchen. When we came across this I was sceptical it would be any good but we are already using it constantly; playing music (via Spotify), the radio, asking for weather updates, setting alarms l, asking for simple recipes etc. Really worthwhile for the price and we're already thinking about getting them for the bedrooms as they are so unobtrusive. You won't regret buying this."
5.0,a year ago,lowes.com,Works right out of the box,Using the Google mini chalk is like having a personal assistant except you don't have to pay Google mini overtime. And Google is easier to train. The GE Smart bulb is a handy extra. It's great for working in bed until you're sleepy and then just turning out the light on voice command without having to leave that cozy position.
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Worth it in a small package,"This is a marvelous product by Google. Totally worth it. Initially I was sceptical with such a small speaker, but the sound is pretty decent and Google does whatever it is being told to over voice. Even with a high volume, I can easily pause it or ask something completely different and it does respond."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great sound,I love the google mini. I have the amazon Echo Dot as well but I think the sound and speech is so much better than the Dot. Easy set up and works with my various smart home devices. I purchased another one for my husbands birthday. Would recommend this. It is a great way to try out the Google Home devices.
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great voice assistant speaker for the $,"Got two of these little guys - one for myself and one for the girlfriend - and we are happy with both of them. The speaker is lacking a bit on the bass side and is not as high quality as my portable bluetooth speaker, but having the voice assistant balances out this weakness. If you're part of the Google ecosystem, the assistant becomes even better and more useful - particularly with the growing pervasiveness of smart home products. Perfect little speaker for on a nightstand in the bedroom."

5.0,6 months ago,Currys,Nigel's review of Google Home Mini,Pros: The google hub does turn my smart tv off and opens apps when I want them. The volume is good for the size of the device. Cons: It is limited on tasks. You have to spend a long time setting the google hub up.
5.0,2 years ago,thegoodguys.com.au,CHESTER's review of Home Mini - Chalk,"Pros: A quick and easy assistant that provides support and entertainment. The speakers are decent for it's small size. It provides a lot of information along with games, music and connection to other compatible devices e.g. lights, TV, speakers, etc. Cons: The device doesn't have any additional connections such as AUX (it just has USB). This however can be overcome with wireless connections. It also needs to run while connected to power (so it won't run as a charged device)."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great little smart assistant,"A friend gave me a Google Home for Christmas. I was so impressed that I purchased a Home mini while it was still on sale. I needed to replace an alarm clock in my bedroom. Instead the mini serves that purpose. When I wake up in the middle of the night, it tells me the time and temperature. I can set it to wake me up with Enya in the morning. It will also tell me jokes and fun facts to help me fall asleep. I can even use it to make telephone calls. I use it every day and I love it."
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Nice addition to Google home,"I bought this to have automation controls through voice in our bedroom as well. We have the Google Home in the living. The only negative I see is that the two devices are not synced up. I have to setup them up individually. I have not spent a lot of time looking into this, so it might be something that I am not doing correctly. For example, I can turn off some lights from the mini but the home device does not recognize the same command. This is the main reason for 4 stars instead of 5."
5.0,a year ago,lowes.com,Setup is the fastest I've ever experienced,"It took me about 4min to setup from package unboxing to having it synced on my tablet. As an electrician, i install many different devices and home automation controls ranging in price and comparability. The google smart home devices are very well designed, very affordable and placed along with those in high end custom homes."

He absolutely loves it and it's perfect for starting a small Smart House."
5.0,a year ago,Office Depot,Hey Google is great,"I purchased this for my wife who is typically a little skeptical of technology. After a short tutorial from me she is now happily using the mini home to listen to music, and answer all those crazy questions that come up in the course of a day. I recommend this product for anyone whether they are a techie or not. It is easy to set up and use."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Perfect for the price,"I bought this online on Black Friday and the transaction itself was easy. The item is good especially for the price. I do not have a smart home (alarm, lights or thermostat controlled by my phone) so it is perfect for little inquiries without having to physically search on my phone. Alarms, timers, weather, music. One thing i don't like is the inability to use it as a speaker for my cell phone- only what is streaming through google mini vs my cell like youtube or a streaming app. Not enough to discourage me from my purchase because we all love it."

4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Doing well so far,"I picked up two of these for $50/on sale. I added them to my already in place Google Home system. Added in quickly, responds well. My only issue (minor) is the placement of the side volume keys - sometime a bit awkward for me to use them so I almost always control volume by voice. Other than this, working well. Would really rate 4.5 if I could."
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great product if you use google ecosystem but ...,"This works seamlessly with my google chromecasts (video and audio). It currently supports Netflix, HBOGO, Vicki, YouTube, and CBS. It doesn't support Hulu which is a bummer. As far as music, it supports Google play music, YouTube Music, Spotify, and Pandora. I thought it also support TuneIn but I guess it doesn't. So it needs to expand available streaming services like hulu, podcast addict, etc. For the price, $29.99 with a $10 Best Buy gift card, I'm happy with the purchase."

Now i have been using this product for few weeks and I am very satisfied.

4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,great and convenient gadget,I bought the mini google assistant after seeing one work at a friends home. The mini is very easy to use once you have it synced with your internet wifi. This is not as easy as I thought but once I figured it out it made listening to music and watching tv much easier and save a great deal of time I like Hey google and most likely will purchase another .
3.0,2 years ago,thegoodguys.com.au,Rob's review of Home Mini - Charcoal,"Pros: Good for setting alarms and you really need a subscription with a music provider like YouTube Red, Spotify, or Google Play Music. The speaker is surprisingly good/loud. Cons: Cannot make calls with it yet like you can in America, which is a bit of a disappointment. Skype integration would be nice. It still needs a lot of work understanding the Australian accent. Cortana is still better in that regard. A bit of a gimmick but hey, why not."
5.0,4 months ago,Best Buy,Great product,Product is great. Wish it was easy to use with iPhones. It frequently disconnects from iPhones. Not sure if it’s an Apple issue or a google issue. Never had the problem when I owned a android phone.

5.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Keeps me company,"This mini does exactly what I want it to do. Already having a google home downstairs, its great to have this in the bedroom.....I mainly use it to play music, all styles, depending on my mood. Its unobtrusive and so small I sometimes forget its there. Its fun to ask for random information too. Surely its capable of much more than I ask it to do, but being a senior, I just like to have fun."
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Almost perfect,"The Home Mini is a great addition to Google's line of Google Assistent-powered products. The speaker is better than its nearest competitor, the Amazon Echo Dot. Voice responses are loud and clear. Music sounds fine at lower levels, but the quality drops as the volume increases (typical of speakers in this price range). It makes a great desk speaker. The only thing keeping it from a 5-star rating is the lack of an audio-out option, like what the Echo Dot has."
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Great all around speakers!,"Bought a couple of these speakers for the other rooms at my place. No hassle, easy plug and play installation. Now I can even play the same music playlist on all the speakers simultaneously!"

5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Good as an information source,"We have numerous ""smart home"" devices, including another voice assistant system in almost every room, but wanted a source to query Google's search engine.

Now I use it daily for all kinds of information and as a timer When cooking, I play music and get sport scores oh and being able to turn the light on and off by voice is actually more helpful than you’d think, It also dims the light so I set it to 1% and use it as night light . It is an awesome product !!"
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Google Mini is great.,I have a couple of these in different rooms. They are great for controlling lighting and other electronic devices in any room. Always there for a quick question and it will even play trivia games with the family.

5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Ease of usage,"I love that you just have to plug it in and it works. I can talk to it from almost any room in my house and it responds -- good range of ""hearing."" It works well with my TV. I am sure there are at least a dozen more things that it does that I have not yet discovered."
5.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Looks nice. Fits anywhere,This is a great device. The sound is not as good as the regular size Google Home but that is expected. We only use it to voice control our smart devices and check the weather.
5.0,2 years ago,harveynorman.com.au,Fantastic,"I absolutely love my Google home mini I have 2 , One in Kitchen the other is in the bedroom. I use these everyday from setting alarms to date reminders and events I also ask what the weather is like for the day before I even get up. Great sound as I have music playing most days. Anyone can use it easy I even bought my 70 year old mum one for her birthday she sits it in the kitchen and is always asking it question or playing her music. She even tells good jokes lol. Go out and buy one they are fantastic."
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Good voice recognition but often not working,"I have Amazon Echo and bought Google Home mini to compare how they work. Google Home has great voice recognition and understand the context quite well. Conversations seem little smother than Alexa. The issue is with reliability. I often received the response that it has some issue (while Alexa worked well, so I don’t think it is my Internet or wifi issue). I wasn’t sure if it was outages at Google or something else. Overall, I enjoy this new assistant."
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Met expectations,"I have both a Google Home and Google Home mini. The sound quality of the mini is fine. Music sounds good enough for something that small, better than my bluetooth speaker the same size. Podcasts sound pretty good. For some reason, I find the response time on the mini faster than on my Home. My only complaint is they disabled the top tap feature, which means I have to vocally stop it every time. But rumor is that it will be reinstated, so I am not too concerned."

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,It works well,"We bought a few of these minis and set them in various rooms. They work well together. We also connect the minis to our Android phone so when we give the commands, the minis also respond. One strange thing: Google mini lights up at random times when we don't even talk to it. Not sure if this is a glitch, but it's disturbing."
4.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Cute little speaker,The speaker is actually louder than I expected. Google assistant is by far the best assistant out there. I mostly use it to wake me up but it's very helpful with random questions and controlling other devices.
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Awesome Voice Controlled Device for Anyone,"I use my google home mini everyday. It was very easy to setup via my smartphone. Thus far, I have added one light switch and two plugin devices where I can turn them on or off with simple voice commands. I also use it to listen to free google play music, as well as, I ask ""Hey Google"" for information like the weather, interesting facts, as well as, when different events happened. Overall, I highly recommend the Google Home Mini to everyone."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great addition to the Google Home,"Bought Google Home last year and sunk a lot of $ into smart lights and switches. Can’t imagine not having it now. As we expected, Google came out with these and to add to whole home functionality with voice prompts we added two of these little guys. We’re about 80% complete in refurbishing our small 1400sq ft condo in all “smart” devices. These things help and we’re all too affordable to pass up. For what we ask them to do, spot on. Keep it coming Google!"

App says it is unsupported on Apple products and don’t seem able to connect it to correct Google Chromecast. Followed instructions but some of the steps do not appear so we haven’t yet managed to resolve these issues
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great product for the home,It was easy to setup and hooking it up smart bulbs and plugs was a breeze. It's so much easier to turn on the lights using my voice instead of physically turning on/off the switch. I like this color better.
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Very helpful device,"I paid $30 for the Mini and got a $10 Best Buy gift card, setting the total cost at $20. That being said, I believe that the Google Home is definitely worth what I spent. It's handy to have near the kitchen so that I can set timers and have it read me recipes while cooking. It also works great as an external speaker when I connect my phone or laptop to it via bluetooth in order to play music, or when I want to listen to some music on Spotify while doing dishes. Also, when I notice that I am running low on something around the house, I can ask it to add the item to my shopping list so that I won't forget when I'm at the store."

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Worth the money,"I have already provided my review for the chalk model. Nothing much left, except the reason for not giving the 5-star rating. Here are few reasons for it: 1. I wish it could play the audio part of the youtube. 2. Has the ability to play from my personal collection. 3. Does not have an aux/earphone output to hook this to an active speaker for better sound. 4. A rechargeable battery with a base can improve its mobility."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Good product , can be better","This is a good product with good sound quality. Smart speakers have a great potential in the future but this one can handle limited operations. I use it to listen to music , turn on off lights and for weather forecast and for news (BBC and CNN) and does all of that elegantly. It would say 'I cant help you with that yet' more often than you would expect."

I'm much happier with the Alexa enabled devices I replace this with."
4.0,5 months ago,Bed Bath & Beyond,Hey Google,"So far it has be of some use but not all the time. It can't answer some questions and has no idea what you are talking about.

5.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Fantastic,I didn’t know anything about smart speakers before I brought this item. It was a simple set up and sounds fantastic. The google now voice is just amazing and sounds natural and it’s a great alarm.
4.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Nice device for the TV,I like this device because it works well with a TV using a Chromecast. The only problem is that it doesn't natively support Apple music so you have to use bluetooth streaming to play Apple music.

It's small, very cool design and the most impressive thing is that the speaker is very loud! It's ideal to play music with the connected account, I am actually swtiching from my old JBL Bluetooth speaker to this. The configuration is really easy: just download the Google Home app and follow the instructions on the smartphone: I have done it on a iPhone and I have had no issue."
5.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Great for office or kitchen,Really great sound for such a small device. I have it setup in my office and it connects with my Spotify account. Music can play so low that it won’t bother others or loud enough that you can jam out!

5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Assistant that never stops learning,"I'm very happy about the Google home assistant. I linked it to a smart-plug that allows me to turn a bedside lamp on and off by voice, it controls my TV via a Chromecast and it even wakes me up in the morning with news recaps I chose and interesting facts. It gets updated pretty often. I thought it was missing a feature to create custom commands to trigger several actions, it has been added few days after I bought it! I can now say ""Hey google, I'm going to sleep"" and the assistant will stop playing movie/music, shutdown the TV and turn the lights off!"
4.0,a year ago,staples.com,more competent than Alexa,"For its relatively low price, this device has a lot to offer. For one, Google Assistant seems to be a bit more knowledgeable and capable than Amazon 'a Alexa, with way less ""I don't know"" answers. I do wish there was an audible cue to start speaking, as I am often unable to see it the way my apartment is arranged. Still, I'd choose this over the Echo For any day. I also like how it can link up to my Chromecast."

Easy set up, picks up on my voice at normal tone from across the room (this can deteriorate over time as I’ve experienced this with my first one), and it co-exist with my phone very well when I ask google questions, it’ll notify me of what I’ve asked onto my phone so I can look further into it"
3.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Ok,I haven’t used the google mini very much. I already have Alexa in the living room. I tried google in the bedroom for music but got a little frustrated with it. I was always trying to get the volume at a good level and trying some night routines.

These mini's are perfect for placing in kitchens and bedrooms to use as alarm clocks, timers or just listening to music.

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Very good.,"For being so small the speaker really cranks out the volume. Also the home mini is typically pretty good about detecting my voice. Google assistant is by far the superior voice assistant and I love how it interacts with all of my other google products or serivces (chromecast, android, iphone, etc). For the price it's definitely worth it. Only things I would change is being able to run aux out in to another set of speakers and the ability to change the alarm sound to something that acutally wakes me up."

Cons: Very limited functionality. Cannot make calls or send messages, often cannot answer basic questions and you need to pay to get most services to work.

It turns on my Shield TVs in my Family room and Bedroom. It controls my Nest thermostat. Kids love playing games with it. Even my tech wary wife is being won over. Now should I get a third one?"
3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Nice as an alarm clock!,"Use it mainly as an alarm clock because trying to get it to play our apple library has been a challenge. It’s always telling us we need to sign up for a YouTube subscription.

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,decent item,"As a speaker it's decent, very little bass. I would suggest this if you are in the google ecosystem. This means Google play music YouTube chrome cast etc. It does some cool stuff but at time's no matter how you phrase things it won't understand commands. Some nice functions are its ability to call people and turn on the tv, but you need a Google voice number and a chrome cast to do these things. I imagine with time it will get better. I am using it more than I expected to though. It's hard to review this it's very niche at them moment."

The sound from the device is reasonably good and is very comparable to the echo dot. Apparently the top was designed to be a button, but google has disabled that. It would be great to see them re-enable that or give some sort of compensation to the owners who are left without that functionality. That was a very useful way to turn off alarms and timers that has been removed."

If you have tv running in the background, 9 out of 10 times, mini will not hear you.

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,For the price point it's a great product,"I use this home mini as my alarm, also to control my Phillips hue bulbs, vizio tv, and it's a good sounding speaker. Sometimes you have to repeat the command multiple times and sometimes it's not accurate but it does evolve over time. Overall it's a great price point at $29 it's a fully functional speaker and Google Home assistant. The only thing is that it's a stationary station. Meaning it does not have a portable battery feature, it has to be plugged in at all times."
5.0,2 years ago,very.co.uk,Nifty gadget,"My parents have Alexa, so I went for this after trying it on my phone. It recognises different people/accounts by voice, so other people can't mess up your reminders. Home control, lights and plugs, is very cool ""Hey google, set the big bedroom light to 50%"" even dims the bulbs (philips hue). The alarm function is super useful, and generally it's a neat piece of kit to have to help automate things. The shopping list feature is useful, too - just tell it to add things as you remember then view it on your phone in the shop."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Exactly what you expected,"The setup was as simple as plugging it in and running the app. After that, it just worked. No, the sound isn't great, but that isn't the purpose. It is adequate for the intended purpose. It is a great expansion to an existing system. The Holiday price made it easy to pick up two for other places in the house. The ""Broadcast"" functionality works great. Way better than just shouting between floors."
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Lots of fun!,"We purchased on a whim cause the guy in the store had such positive things to say. It really is a fun device and very applicable to more than I realized. I still haven't unlocked it's full potential, I'm sure. It can read recipes to you, step by step, which I never knew I needed in my life! You can play trivia with a group! Check and manage your calendar! That's all I've used it for thus far. Oh, and the obvious, asking questions. It definitely isn't as ""smart"" as it could be. But it actually is easier to converse with than Siri."
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Good for Nineteen,"I got this on sale for twenty bucks, and for that amount the product works well enough. In some cases, the mini surprises me with how good the information it returns is, but it still has a ways to go to be incredible. It got way more useful with an IFTTT recipe to add items to my favorite list app, so if it can't do what you want check there. Speaker is loud and sounds decent enough, just lacks bass because of its size. Combining with a chromecast audito for multi room audio works well."
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Decent little smart home device,"I've been an Alexa user since Amazon first offered them to Prime members, and have always been curious if the Google Home was any better. When the price on the Home Mini dropped, I figured I'd try it out and see. After using it for a couple weeks, it does some things better than Alexa (smart home integration is easier to manage for one, searching the web for things is MUCH better), and some things worse (sound quality with music, staying connected to my wireless network). Overall I'd say it's great for the price, but I prefer it in conjunction with Alexa, as opposed to instead of her."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Must Get with Google Home,"You wouldn't think it by its' size but it's a powerful little speaker but most of all its a Google. You can ask it questions and to perform tasks just like the Google Home. When used with the Google Home it even acts as an intercom (my personal fav), no more yelling across the house and no faking they didn't hear you ;) It can recognize different indv based on their voice and (for minors under 13) you can monitor what they are listening to among other things. The list of things they can do grows every day. We are very happy with ours."
1.0,a year ago,Target,Useless unless you let it track your search and browsing history,"It's pretty limited if you don't enable Web & App Activity, which basically means tracking your search/browsing history. I can't even ask it to Play Shakira on Spotify unless I let it track my history or Start Vacuuming. I keep it as a cute speaker, but this got me curious about Alexa, which is less creepy."

3.0,a year ago,Currys,Straff's review of Google Home Mini,"Pros: It’s good to connect to smart devices and keep things in your control. Cons: Not everything is easily understood by G Mini. Sometimes it’s slow in its response and making calls is fine but trouble is when you need to choose options G Mini fails and call is hung. There are times it hangs, no response and gives wrong results."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great voice assistant,"I have not tried Alexa and probably will not. These mini things can pick up sound from far off and respond accordingly. I have 3 of them set up at my small place. It is continuously learning. we no longer use a remote to watch tv (no cable, netflix only) and if we go somewhere we have to get ourselves reacquainted with it."

5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Small but mighty,"There is really nothing to it but it still does so much. I like it for areas like the bedroom or bathroom, I don't want video in those areas and still want to control whatever I have running on the network. Sounds good too for as small as it is."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Works great for very small rooms,"The Google assistant works just as good as in the standard Home or Max, but don't plan on rocking out to very loud tunes as it's a very small speaker. I put this one in the bathroom and have it synced with the rest of the Home's in my house, so it gives just enough to add some sound to the bathroom when I play them all together. I do like it's compact size."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Better than I Expected,"Good sound, like the lights, works as advertised. I bought these to go along with a nest hello installation since my whole house intercom system wouldn’t integrate.

5.0,a year ago,Target,AWESOME!,"Ok WOW!!!! This is so neat! It's something that I never knew I needed! It's seriously so convenient. I love how you can adjust the brightness of the light too.

5.0,9 months ago,Bed Bath & Beyond,We love it.,"Bought the Google mini and Google Home in December. Fantastic. Use it every day. Great for reading recipes and cooking, setting alarms, playing mucic. The list doesn't end."
3.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Prefer alexa,"As an owner of an echo dot I bought the google mini to see how they compare. The biggest difference is that this doesn't have a port for an aux jack so you can't plug in a speaker. Also it has blue tooth, just not the ability to connect to an external speaker like Alexa does. I also find the selection of free music from google play isn't as a wide variety as the free amazon music. Google is definitely louder volume wise, just not sound quality. My vote is Alexa over google"

5.0,a year ago,Target,Love Google Home,"Google Homes are extremely useful and fun. You can't beat the sales price!

5.0,a year ago,Office Depot,Little speaker with Loud Voice,"I was hesitant to order this because it was on sale and just seemed too good to be true, but this speaker is amazing. I have an Alexa dot and this is so much louder and the spreaker is so much clearer. Connecting it to our network was super easy and and its small enough to sit behind a photo on counter. Definitely recommend 5 stars"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great smart home device!!,"This definitely is a helpful and useful. You can do it all with the Google assistant.

It's a great way to start the day."

4.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Great fun,We have great fun talking to Google. It's very good as long as you refer to the app e.g it will remember your shopping list but you have to go to the app to amend it. Overall excellent value for money. It's not the Amazon version but for the price well worth it. The news given out when you speak to it for the first time is really useful and the weather at anytime is great.

Sound quality is good enough for what I use them for."
4.0,a month ago,Currys,Faye's review of Google Home Mini,Pros: I listen to the sound of thunderstorms when I go to sleep. It plays for the length of time I want. I love the hands free control you have. Cons: You can ask it to play a specific song.
4.0,2 years ago,Currys,Karl's review of Google Home Mini,Pros: Assistant sounds the best out of all the virtual assistants. Surprisingly good sound from such a small device. Can put stuff on the tv using your voice with the right setup. Cons: Rarely but Sometimes one of mine doesn’t hear first time. Even with low background noise. My others I can pretty much whisper to but this one I have to use a louder than normal voice to be heard.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Very smart home device - better than Alexa,Google is smarter than Alexa at handling everyday questions. Sound quality is also better than the Echo Dot. I have one in the kitchen & it can handle anything from basic timer to weather to controlling smart home devices
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Does What It Should,I have the original Google Home and was surprised to see how the Mini seems to have a better microphone system. I was also surprised to see how loud it gets. I wish the touch controls were more obvious but good anesthetic overall.
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,"Great, better than the Echo IMO","Picked this item up at my local Best Buy because the price couldn’t have been better, took it home and played with it to see which was more useful and gave better information, Google Home or the Amazon Echo. After just a few minutes of asking Alexa questions and then asking Google Home the same questions, I found that the Home provided better, more relevant information which is no doubt because of its access to the Google search engine. If you like having toys get both, if you only want one, buy this one. It has many more pros and less cons than the Echo."
5.0,2 years ago,Target,Good at its job,"Great product, works well with quick setup. Surprisingly loud for how small it is. However, don't buy it for music listening. Sound is pretty shallow, not much fun to listen to. If you want music listening, go up to the larger Home, or pair it with a Chromecast audio on a real stereo. That being said, for every day tasks like weather, news, and smart home control, this is a phenomenal little product. P.S. it's adorable"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great google mini,Love having the convenience of the combination of a mini google and light bulb. It’s easy to set up and makes me feel a sense of security when I arrive at home to a darkened house. I am amazed by the technology that is at our fingertips and of course our voice.
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Comparing to Amazon Products,"I purchased the Google Home Mini to compare it to the existing Amazon products I have (Echo, Tap, Dot). Overall the functionality has been the same between the two ecosystems. I use Amazon Music Unlimited, Amazon FireTV, Amazon Shopping, and Prime Video, so it makes more sense to use Amazon products rather than Google. The Home Mini seems to accept a wider range of questions/comments phrased in different ways, sometimes you have to say things a very specific way with Amazon devices. The Home Mini also has a more natural sounding AI voice."
4.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Google best mini,"Good quality speaker! Music sounds good, and response rate is quick. Its definitely a must have addition for rooms that don't have Home Hubs! Also helps it was only 20 bucks on black Friday!"
3.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Not as simple as Alexa,"Got the Google mini thinking to might be better than the Alexa but after getting it setup I'm not impressed. Setup wasn't easy, the app won't work with my old iOS version. So I had to find another way to set it up. Once set up it was a challenge locating where to setup my home automation. It also only supports certain TV apps for the chromecast which is a disappointment. Overall I think I'd buy another Alexa before another Google mini."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Chose this over Amazon's Echo becasue of phone,I chose the Google system over the Amazon Echo because it will dial your phone and the Amazon system won't. It works seamlessly with my smartphone and my contact list. I decide to equip the entire house. although it won't call 911 I looked up the direct numbers. This is a cheap alternative to Lifeline.
5.0,a year ago,very.co.uk,Amazing gadget,"I bought one of these for myself and I have to say it’s fantastic. Simple to set up and speaker is excellent.

1.0,a year ago,Best Buy,HORRIBLE!,"Does not integrate with Hue lights AT ALL. It locates them, but if you tell it to turn one off, it says, OK, we've turned off 5 lights. Then you say, turn that ONE light on, and it says, OK, we've turned on 13 lights. Totally ridiculous as I've set my lights up in Hue and also have them working with Alexa and they respond PERFECTLY. Not so with this thing. It's going back today."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Welcome to the new age,Technology such as this makes us more efficient. We can focus on other things while this device takes a load off us.

I love it reading the bible for me!

4.0,2 years ago,John Lewis,"Great, but could be better","As far as smart speakers go, it's great value for money. The sound quality is actually better than I expected from reading reviews elsewhere, and the volume range is quite large for such a small device. That said, there's still a lot of room for improvement from the Google assistant side of things. Still waiting for the calling feature to be released in the UK, as well as a lot of other features that so far are only available in the US. Hopefully these updates will come soon to make the Google Home fully activated"

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,One for the sauna....,I started with the original Home and added a Mini. Gifted a Hub to wife for the kitchen and got the two free Minis. Then received a Mini as a gift. I think that's enough! The sound is quite good for a small device and several are primarily used to replace a radio. Waiting to see how it holds up in the heat and humidity of the sauna.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Little Speaker,I purchased this to start my home automation journey. I like that I can simply ask it to find various radio stations and to start streaming them. I also like that I can control some home automation devices by speaking to it as well. It's small and compact and does not look like an eye sore sitting out in the middle of the room.

In fact, I was so pleased that I bought 2 additional devices for gifts."

Usage wise, Google Home is used every day and all the time where as Amazon's product falls flat in following a string of queries that are related as well as a bunch of other areas that found me just never saying ""Alexa"". Google is a little slow on adding some features the devices are capable of and I'm not too sure why but overall it is the winner in my books, hands down. Going to get the Google Home Maxx when it comes out as well."

Sound quality is not audiophile, but pretty good, but that is not what I bought it for. I bought when the deal was on, basically 3 for 2, so I have one in my living room, one in the kitchen and one in the bedroom. Cons: Only thing I could say is the power lead should have been black to match, rather than white. Pretty minor eh!"

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Google Product,"I have Amazon Alexa, but wanted to give Google Home a try since I used Google Assistant all the time.

5.0,a month ago,ebay.com,Google home mini smart,It's a good gadget has plenty of information good for recipes but. Not keen on having to say hey Google before interacting with gadget it has voice recognition. And having to subscribe to music sites to play the music you want to hear.
3.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great little gadget to have,"This item takes up hardly no space but that outlet it came with is a real bummer. The outlet takes up two slots side by side on my power strip. Google has disabled the touch button on the center of the home mini permanently which is a huge let down. It is one of the reasons I bought it, I was not made aware of this when I bought the item from BestBuy or their product page. The home mini does everything and some more that google can do on your smartphone, but doesn't require a smartphone to do so once set up."

5.0,2 years ago,Currys,Graeme's review of Google Home Mini,Pros: It’s good for older people and easy to use although it requires voice recognition for certain functions. Cons: Can’t play your music from iTunes through it you have to purchase google music this is a con and needs addressing. I wouldn’t recommend this to others based on the fact your conning people who might not know best and it’s not expensive after the free trial you’d be better with Smazon model because it’s got a built in hue hub and you can use the drop in function in other users which google doesn’t allow yet. Must get better !!!!!!
4.0,a year ago,ebay.com,2 small problems.,1 Voice recognition could be better on this particular Google home mini. 2 Google said that a Google home device would be able to tell which device a person was speaking to even if that person uses several Google home devices or has the app enabled on a phone. In practice this is sometimes not the case it's an irritant not a big problem

It doesn't understand most of the things we want to be played in TV. Also making it understand about TV itself is not so easy. But its worth a try. dont keep high expectations

5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Nice addition to my smart home,"I bought 2 of these to put in different rooms and the setup was very easy. Google is still learning, but it integrated with my other Smartthings well. It's pretty cool to just yell at Google to play music by whatever artist I want to hear at the moment :) *note, it doesn't seem to be capable of playing the same thing simultaneously in different rooms - no whole home stereo effect. It can play different things simultaneously though."

5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Best among smart speakers,I own amazon echo dot and now Google home mini. I must say this is truely amazing. Fast and smarter than any other smart speaker. It is ideal to keep on bedside table. Sound quality is average but it's very good for it's size. I usually control my TV via Chromecast and it works like a charm. I also use it's reminder and alarm clock function. Highly recommended product.

5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Excellent and very responsive,I bought this totally because of the Black Friday deal. Little did I know that I was going to love it. The games you can ask google to play are pretty fun. It works perfectly with chrome cast. For $20 to $30 its totally worth it. I wouldn’t pay any more than that. The voice response even with having loud music and talking in background it will hear you. Also what surprised me the most is it recognized and understood my baby girls mumbling lol.

5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Just what I expected,I already had the google home. I bought the minis so I could control my plugs from two other rooms. I can now turn my living room lights off from the comfort of the bed. As a bonus I can have whole house speakers without having to cut holes in the ceiling and for a much smaller cost. Just set these up in a group and they will all play the same music at the same time. Great purchase. Can't wait to see how far Google goes with keeping these up to date and adding new things.

It was a blast to ask questions no matter where you are as long as you’re hooked up to Wi-Fi and it recognizes it.

Another thing I like is that you can personalize what you want to many to give to you like sports updates, weather updates, news updates.

I don't use it that often and don't use it for music, so this smaller size suited me well. Only issue is that it responds to random this on my TV, which is VERY annoying. I also wish it was a little smarter than it currently is. I wish it worked flawlessly with Harmony Remotes."

1.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Amazon Echo is much better device,"I had a Amazon Alexa and as I use Google G Suite for my work I thought being a Google product it will work even better. However this product cannot do even basic task due to some technical issues with the application and Google developers are still working on it with no date of completion. Also, I found that Echo was more intuitive and human like with the answers to the queries."

The mini wins hands down in our household because, while it doesn't have all of the ""skills"" that Alexa there's less to remember, it's more user friendly, has a better speaker, and seamlessly connects to Spotify. Another benefit is that the mini doesn't randomly come on like the dot does. Two thumbs up!"

5.0,2 years ago,walmart.com,"Hey, Google!!",What a blast! And I love the Walmart rebate so I really got my mini on the cheap. All the deals that Walmart gives me only creates more loyalty in my relationship with this store! The google home sits where Alexa sat for over a year. She’s been moved to my office but having the mini near the family room/kitchen is extremely handy. I think google is smarter than Alexa in the unmodified stage. Such a handy device for kids of all ages also!

You can ask it to stop playing after a certain amount of time. Those are my favorite features, but it does a lot more."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,This is a pint sized dynamo,"I caught an online promotion of the Google Mini on Best Buy and looked up the product. I was not very sure of how the AI would work in real life but bought it nevertheless. This ones a winner all the way really - i was super impressed with the packaging to begin with... you know how some devices are packaged in such a lousy manner but this was super easy to open. It only got better, was so easy to configure & deploy... and lastly, usage.... it is wonderful. It ingests and works through all the requests we have made and we're loving it"

1.0,a year ago,bestbuy.ca,Don't buy it for home automation,It takes anywhere from 7-20 seconds just to do simple things like open a garage door or turn on a light. I have a 500/20mbit connection so that's not the issue. The issue is it's under-powered. The Google Home does not have this problem. It's fine if you just want queries or to listen to music.
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Fun product with many uses,"I have several Google Home products including a few minis, and I love them. I love the instant access to info, timers, and some fun games. I really like the home control integration. The minis don't have the best speaker quality, but there are others in the line for that. And for the price, you wouldn't really expect it too. It's a solid product with a ton of uses that can be tailored to your personal living experience."
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Best choice for home automation,I use both Amazon Alexa and Google to operate SmartThings. Google is better and faster at voice recognition. If you are looking for a device to pair with Smarthings choose Google. I only wish that you could play announcements when doors / sensors are triggered. Google could stand to have more apps and features. The speakers itself sounds great for music in small rooms.
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great Mini Home Speaker,I haven't tried all the features just yet. But what I have used is the music player. It understands Spanish way more than Alexa. It's able to give me Spanish music stations and by name of the artist. The volume is really good for a small speaker. It has a decent Mic as well. The Google home app on my phone doesn't work but on my husband's it does. Still need to figure out what's going on.
1.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,No control,"This device sucks in comparison to the echo. There is no way to control who has access to the device. So as a college student it is useless to me, and parents won’t be able to control if kids mess with speakers all over the house. It also requires chrome audio cast to use a better speaker, adding another $35 to get closer to what the echo already has built into it. I do not recommend this device. Buy the dot, it is much more worth the price tag."

4.0,2 years ago,Target,Google vs Echo,"Compared to my Echo’s the system is more intelligent. The software additions is still far behind the Echo. The devices can not Bluetooth the music to remote speakers like Echo. The IHeartRadio only works if you know the channel identification i.e. KFI 640, verses play the Smooth Jazz Channel. If you use Chromecast you get other options but not everyone uses Chromecast as Firesticks have more programming."
4.0,a year ago,lowes.com,"Lights? Check, Fights? Check. Good buy? Check.",Google resolves disputes and controls the lights. Just those two services have been well worth the price. The speaker could be better for music thought so only 4.5 stars for me. You'll use this more than you think.
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Better than Amazon Echo,"I had the full size & mini Amazon Echo products for some time prior to getting a Google Home mini. The Echo was good, but in most regards the Google Home is simply better. The sound quality on this is better than the Echo mini, although not a replacement for good speakers come music time. Google seems to know a lot more and the added bonus of Chromecast & Google Play Music seals the deal for me. I've switched over the Google Home and have been happy."
5.0,2 months ago,Best Buy,Great gift,"We bought this for my father in law and he loves it. We already had one and know how easy to it to set up and use and all the great things it can be used for.

5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great!,Bought three of these on the Black Friday sale for $20 after all is said and done. I put them around my house so I could have google assistant all over. I love that I can stream music to the whole house at the same time. They look cool. The only thing I would like to change is for them to have a line out so I can connect them to my speaker system. I know I can just get a chromecast audio but that does not include google assistant. I love these little pucks

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,"Fantastic home assistant, sub par speaker","I love this little guy. It's a lot cheaper than the original Google Home or even the original Amazon Echo and it has no trouble understanding me or my grandfather for the most part. I mostly use it to plan out my day such as asking it for the weather, but it can even tell me what Pokemon evolve into and silly things like that. The speaker isn't the greatest and I wish it could aux out to a better speaker or at least bluetooth to one. Overall, a great purchase!"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Excellent product and price.,"The Google Home Mini has all the same capabilities as a Google Home minus a better sounding speaker. This mini is no slouch when it comes to sound, but compare it to a regular Google Home, Hub, or Max, it doesn't sound as good. Then again, it's focus and strength is in Google Assistant and smart home capabilities."
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,"Great assistant, so-so speaker","We really enjoy having the Google Assistant in our home. We have 2 regular Google Home devices as well, and it is awesome that all three devices can work together to play music (kinda like a Sonos). Speaker quality is not that great (definitely not like a Sonos), but for the money it is good enough. The mini speaker is really ""tinny"" compared to the normal Google Home. But Google Assistant is amazing (better than Alexa, imho)."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Google does it again,"I have the original Google Home so I wanted one of these to work with it for my home automation purposes (I have smartthings lights throughout the house). Now only do the two devices work seamlessly together, but this one is small enough to easily hide in your house. I see me buying a few more in my near future to make my entire house a smart home in every room. In my experience Google is much smarter than Alexa, so much so my wife actually uses it daily when she would get frustrated with the Echo."

4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Not Bad If You Get It On Sale,Smaller than the standard Google Home. Sound quality is acceptable but do not expect great fidelity when playing music. Seems to do everything that the Google Home can do. This would be useful in places where you already can play music on other quality devices.
4.0,2 weeks ago,Best Buy,Has more info/music than I was expecting!,I bought this as a Christmas present for my daughter but I already had one and use it every day. You don't know how much information this little jewel has until you ask it a question or have it play some music by a favorite artist.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Quite a novalty,I bought this along with some hue lights to hook them up together.

4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Okay,Don't buy at full price. But if you catch on a deal jump on it. Speaker is not great but the Google Assistant makes up for it. The light bulbs were a plus.

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great for what it is,"Google does not have as much product integration as amazon yet but their assistant is better than alexa at a lot of things. Things such as taking a conversation in context from something you previously asked it. When you know what commands to ask this can be a helpful product and if you have an Android TV or chromecast it can control you home theater setup. With that being said though, for the time being it is really just a novel item that doesn't really add that much functionality to your day to day life."

Alexa you can just say Alexa stop."

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Awesome,Own 4 of these. Use them every day. To either turn on lights or just hear the weather. Love the shopping list. Just tell it what to add and take it to the store with you on your phone. Great for music. Not a big sound but plenty when it is just for easy listening or talk shows.

5.0,2 years ago,harveynorman.com.au,Dynamic little performer,"I bought the google mini for a bedroom after the purchase of a google home was an enormous hit in our household. The mini has all the same features as Google home and belts out impressive sound quality on music. The kids love asking google questions for their homework and I use it for everything from asking the time to finding out what's on at the movies in nearby cinemas. It's a ""must buy"" for anyone who enjoys innovative technology."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,So much fun! Very helpful!,"Surprised how much we use this now. Checking weather, game scores, times for shows, reminders, alarms. Changed to a fun accent too. Just wish we could change the name to Computer or something like Rosie from the Jetsons. Great sound."
5.0,a year ago,Tesco,Speedy delivery and Excellent Item,"The delivery of the Google minis was prompt and efficient. The item itself was very easy to set up and link to our Android phones and is a very useful GADGET to have around the house to help organise your schedule show you the way for journeys and tell you if the way is clear just by asking no typing involved. There are many other features we are still discovering, a great piece of technology"

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great for the price,"I got this on sale for $29 and considering that, the mini is worth it. I bought it to expand on my real Google home, as they can be paired together, even though there is a bit to be desired in ease of getting them together. It's small, convenient, and does everything the larger one does, just doesn't sound as good. It's perfect for our bedroom, as it's not too loud, and still controls smart devices, sets alarms, and can tell us basic info like weather, if asked."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,A great addition to Dorm room,"This device is what daughter wanted for her dorm room ,so was a nice addition and a Valentimes gift that will last past chocolates . She has had nothing but food things to say since she recieved it . Sound is great"

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great to Have at home,"I got the Google Home mini for Christmas and I love it. I have one in my basement and one in my living room/kitchen area. I love using it to play my music while I'm cooking or to turn on a show using my ChromeCast, without ever having to pick up my phone and wasting my phone's charge. The only downside is that it is still ""learning"" so if I ask it questions, it often cannot answer. But it's a minor downfall when you think about the great quality speakers and other components."

The mic can pick up what I say from across the room--impressive. With some smart lights, Nest cameras, and a Chromecast, I'm slowly adapting to controlling my home by voice....and LOVING IT. If you are an audiophile, get the Google Home or the big $400 speaker. If you just want voice commands, these Minis do the trick perfectly and they are inexpensive enough that you can them spread throughout the house."

5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Small but Awesome,I don't know how many I have given away for Christmas this year. At $30 this was a steal. Does all the same things Big Google Home does. No complaints here... Only thing is the mic which you have to sometimes speak up when there is a lot of noise. Like when you playing music with other speakers other than this thing. Big Google Home picks up my voice in loud scenarios. Other than that I love it. I own 2 and plan on more.
5.0,6 months ago,Best Buy,Love this device,I own both the Google home and several of the Google home minis. love the handiness of being able to ask my personal assistant a question without having to look it up. Love having weather and information within range of my voice.
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Actually works,"I have it in the kitchen. It was easy to set up / plug and play / join network / sync with my iPhone 8. It is very helpful as it can answer random questions and actually works! I use it as a calculator, timer, reminder, etc. It streams music. A great feature is it recognizes voices and answers questions accordingly, e.g., what’s on my calendar. Streams weather and news. Overall impressive for a mini speaker!"
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,"Great product, great sound","I have a lot of these devices throughout my house. They sync together well and seem to work well. My children enjoy using them. From time to time, I do have issues with the software not responding to my request to play certain songs/playlists, but that is a software issue that I am sure will be remedied. There have been several improvements already to the device, and it connects to more opportunities than I know how to use."

SO MUCH BETTER. this combo is a great deal and I actually went out and got some smart plugs. Love playing YouTube for music from it. Have a Google house now
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great google assistant,I was debating between the google home or waiting for the apple dot and caved for the google home since it was on sale. The google home so far has been amazing! The price for it is worth it too. The sound quality is amazing even though I’ve read that it’s not good. I don’t use it as a main speaker source so I think the speaker in the google home is appropriate for its purpose. It helps me stay organized and syncs with my phones and laptops
5.0,6 months ago,ebay.com,Bargain!,"Absolute bargain. 30 with an extra 20% discount is a steal. It might come with a US plug on it but with the adapter supplied it works just fine. No geolock either so absolutely no issues when connecting to wi-fi,phones,etc"

This speaker can have trouble hearing you in a noisy room (it is located under the TV in the bonus room so this could contribute). The size and design blends well into the media center (I ordered the charcoal color). This product is worth the money if you are looking to step into the smart home segment with voice control."

Quite an expensive gimmick to be honest

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Almost what I expected,"The good news is that it performs just like the Google home unit. The great news is the speaker has way better audio than I expected. The bad news is I purchased the gray one, and it has a white AC adapter and cord. I purchased the dark one to blend into where it is going, but now there is an ugly white cord hanging out. While it may not make a difference in a cell phone charger, it does in a unit that will be plugged in all the time. A miss for sure"

5.0,a year ago,Office Depot,"Really like it, wish it had better touch buttons","We love our Google homes. We have 1 big one and 2 small ones. The only thing I don't like is the top buttons can be touchy at times to hit correctly. Not enough for me to not give it 5 stars though. Great sound, great R&D done on these things."
4.0,2 years ago,Currys,Johan's review of Google Home Mini,"Pros: The appearance is simple, yet futuristic and good solid build quality. The sound is good for the size and it recognises voice commands really well. Cons: I am disappointed that Google have decided to disable voice calls (and texts) for the UK version. Also the top touch controls are disabled. This was not made clear in the advertising, in other words the product was advertised with functionality that is not available on UK models."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,So convenient,"Figured it would just be a nice additional speaker for the house, but now I find myself using it for everything! Setting alarms, questions, spotify music, drive time, Google home does it all. And it picks up my voice from across the house (which is honestly a bit creepy) but there is a physical toggle switch to turn the mic off. The speaker is good quality too even for a mini! Thinking of buying more for other rooms!"

3.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"Nice looking, but some sound issues",Mine will sometimes respond at the max volume and quickly go to the set volume. Which is very annoying. i.g. I have it set at volume of 3 but when it responds.. it'll bug out and be at volume 10 which is very startling. Sound is much better than alexa and more visually appealing.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great entertainment,"This device is extremely easy to use and entertaining. It's also helpful to get quick information by just asking for it...like the current temperature or tomorrow's weather forecast. I also enjoy finding out the temperature in a a place that I would like to be living or vacationing. If I'm bored, I can just ask Google to tell me a joke."

Speaker quality is also very nice.
4.0,2 years ago,walmart.com,Google Home Mini,The was a follow-up purchase since I originally purchased 2 units (1 standard & 1 mini) during Christmas. Very impressive unit for the price ($39 sale). Sound is better than I had expected leading me to buy additional remote units. I chose Google because the Assistant provides much better responses than Alexa (or Siri). I have some home automation and trying to find the best ceiling fan solution at the moment with Wink or Insteon.

I play music on it whenever I'm doing the dishes or cooking dinner, cleaning up. It's nice to wake up and make breakfast and ask what the weather will be like or if I need help with recipes. All in all I'd say it's worth it to have it around for convenience."

3.0,a year ago,John Lewis,Really convenient!,I have 2 young children under 3 years old who always ask for music or TV shows to be played. This has made it really easy to talk to my TV and get it to play what I want without having to search for a remote controller. It can be a little temperamental at times but it mostly does what I need it to do when I need it. It can also rewind when you ask it to!

The sound quality, ability to connect and quick response time to any command is amazing. It is perfect as a party speaker or for wine and cheese personal spa night.

5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Perfect mini device,"At the price point, how could you not buy one. It's perfect for what we need it to do, control our smart devices at home. I know the bigger one has a better speaker, but we use our nose speaker at home for music and just connected it to Google home for easier access. I was worried that it wouldn't pick up my voice from across the apartment but it picks it up just fine. I can lay in bed and yell from the room to the Google mini in the living room...and by yell, I mean slightly elevated tone."

You can command everything through the Google assistant app as well. I always turn my lights on just before getting home."

A very nice device especially considering the price point."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Great little device for the money.,"The speaker is as good as any Bluetooth one of similar size but those don’t search for tunes on the internet, adjust the lights, change channels on the tv, tell you if you’ll need an umbrella today, translate a conversation between you and your new Italian friend while standing in the kitchen or talk down a recipe for a new dish you wanna try."

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,"A handy device, overall.","Have the big brother and another (Insignia) relation. Picked Google over Alexa due to depth (I guess).

3.0,a year ago,John Lewis,"ok google, well it's ok but","Can't see what all the hype is about, but it's ok for the money I suppose. It is accurate for the searches you may ask it, apparently one of the better ones. I bought this to link to a nest doorbell, it then announces that someone is at the door if I'm in another part of the house where I've placed it and can't hear the doorbell chime. Handy I guess."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Amazing Home Assistant,"After two months and four Google Home Assistants, I am more than happy with the Home Mini. More and more features are added continuously, making the Google Home a worthy competitor to Alexa. It works great with video and audio Chromecast and devices like Philips Hue and many appliances. Customization is fun and intuitive. I really like this little guy and I'm looking forward to further development."
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great Fun Helpful Little Speaker,"Mini-Google is fun and handy. Makes phone calls, sets alarms, tells you the weather and even cracks jokes. Only problem I have with the service is that it won't play any song on demand unless you have a pay music subscription to services like YouTube Red or Google Music. I does play free music via Google Music just not the actual song you're in the mood for on demand. This is why it gets 4 Stars from me, otherwise it's great."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great for our Needs,"We mainly use this for remembering items on a list, talking to others in a different room, and nature sounds to go to bed with. Oh ya, and phone numbers.

I do like that when my boys ask me a question or to do something like set a timer, I tell them to go ask Google. The other day we were fighting over Spotify in different rooms of the house on our cell phones. My oldest yelled out to Google to play music. Satisfied us all as it played from the living room. Fun novelty, not necessity."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,BEST ITEM YOU CAN BUY FOR YOUR HOME,"I BOUGHT 5 OF THESE AFTER BUYING THE LARGER UNIT LAST YEAR. They are now on every level of my home and every level of my best friend's home. They play any song you've ever heard of, they help with the weather, the crossword puzzle, each machine fills your void thought periods with the knowledge of the world. Great for seniors, those living alone, families with school-age kids. I don't know how we grew up without this thing."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Good Black Friday purchse,I have a google home device and the google mini just adds to home control. Easy set up. Use in the bedroom to control lights and get the time and weather report while still in bed. The sound is better than any alarm clock radio and setting an alarm is easier than with an alarm clock. Many more uses that include a chromecast and bluetooth. Will get more for other rooms.

Whether I'm using Chromecast or the speaker directly, it randomly stops playing Spotify after 1-3 songs.

Next, we realized we could play Mad Libs and that was a blast! Now, it's just become so integrated into our lives that even in the car, Hubby and I often find ourselves on the verge of outwardly say, ""Hey Google"" simply out of habit. It's been so helpful and fun! I just can't wait til they work out the kinks and train this thing to stop telling us it can't help us with certain minor questions every so often."

5.0,3 months ago,Best Buy,Better than Echo Dot,"Home mini is a must for home addition and works well with answering most of the simple questions. Sound is good to listen music. Able to handle turning lights, tv off / on."
5.0,6 months ago,target.com.au,Google Home Mini,"Managed to get this on special for $49! Very happy with that price. This is now our 3rd Google Home Mini in our household, our family loves having it to play music from our Spotify account and to check things like the weather."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great Device Needs Some Improvements,So I purchased this to give to my parents. But I wanted it on my gmail account. But since I have my voice set up on it my Mom isn't able to use it with her voice unless she downloads the app and all that business. I wanted it for my Dad in case of an emergency. Working on trying to find a work around.
4.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Small device with big features,"I mainly got this to replace my Echo because I already pay for Google Play Music and I wanted to use that instead of Prime Music. Minus one star because there's no ""real"" Bluetooth functionality as it can't play to Bluetooth speakers, so I had to end up getting a chromecast to play it on my TV (via my home theater setup)."
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Small form factor,"If you have an Android with Google Assistant, this product is basically an always listening assistant as a speaker. Currently, it can't do much besides what the Google Assistant can already do. However, it is small enough to pleasantly fit in a home and can make your connected home work better (with other smart devices)."
3.0,a year ago,walmart.com,Don't need a Hub like other reviews state,"Although the included bulb only pair to the included mini, unlike other comments the C by GE bulbs don't need a hub. From product page: The C-Life bulb connects directly to Google Home devices via Bluetooth with no additional hub or bridge required to provide quick and easy set up."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Not to shabby,"I have an echo, and 3 dots in my house. I bought this during the black Friday deal to try it out. It actually fares better than the dot in sound quality. I am too invested into the echos at this point to switch over. I ended up giving this to my parents who are 60 years old. I also bought them a few smart plugs. They love it and use it every day for music as well as turning on and off their Christmas lights"
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Lots to love about Google Assistant,"I have an Android phone, a Chromecast and a Chromebook. Suffice it to say that I'm pretty plugged in to the Google ecosystem. Adding a Google Home to the mix has lots of easy productivity enhancements that I like having available. There are some headaches, like the lack of a line out port and fewer functions in the app compared to the Amazon Alexa (which I also have at my house). I have high hopes that the software and options will improve by leaps and bounds in short order."
5.0,a year ago,Target,GOOGLE!,"I already have some Google Home products but I could not pass us the deal Target has on 2 Mini's and 2 Wemo plugs. The Mini is awesome and you can hide them anywhere if you need to. For as little as they are, they actually sound really good. Don't expect great sound, but they sound very good."
5.0,2 years ago,John Lewis,"Brilliant in the Morning, Superbly integrated","Super quality sound when playing music. Has a personality when you say Goodnight, and hand for a Christmas Cracker like Joke. Returning to work after the holidays have found it a replacement for the kitchen radio. Walk in Wake it up and ask about the day, gives a run down on the weather, trains & diary then plays the BBC News Headlines (whilst u get on and make, consume breakfast) Then swap it up, ask for the regular radio station and it plays whatever is on live"
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Good C/P value with function it provides,"Got it free from Tile combo pack. My 2nd Google Home product from Google. Convenient for verbal search, listen internet music, Home automation. Great product with such tiny form factor."
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great for bedroom or small rooms,"I was really excited about buying the Home Mini since I already have 2 regular Homes, and multiple Chromecast devices around the house. I was left slightly underwhelmed by the loudness and bass by the speaker as Google hyped it up a good amount. However, for the price I paid, I wouldn't mind putting one in every bedroom. Larger rooms would likely be better off with the regular sized Home or the Max (if you have $400 to spend)."
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,cheap but smart,"Anyone who has used Google Assistant in the past pretty much knows what they are getting, in terms of capability. Wish it were linked to more apps for music than google play / spotify. Also, not putting on an audio port is just plain cheap on Google's part. Otherwise, does everything you'd want. The mic is extremely sensitive - when asking my phone ""ok google"" in the living room, this (in my bedroom) often responds before the phone."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great little speaker,"I have these things all through the house and pool house. They work great, have impressive sound for the size, and the grouping to play music all through desired areas is fun. Honestly, I think the mini has better sound quality than the full sized one."

I have Both the Amazon Echo (and Echo Dot) and the Google Home (and Mini) and Am WAAAYYY more impressed with the Google! The fact that it differentiates between voices and can pull information from my google accounts specifically for me is AMAZING. It is way more useful to me. Good sound quality off Both the home and mini. Highly recommend."

Bargain bit of kit

When we saw over the holidays that the google home mini was available for $29 (with a $10 Best Buy Gift Card given after purchase) we jumped at the chance to add the speakers all over the house.

3.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,It's om,It's okay but it has its downfalls the fact that they make you buy a Chromecast audio device to cast your music to another device and an Alexa doesn't it just let you do a Bluetooth makes this product not worth it. Only reason why purchased two of these is because I got them free. With my Best Buy points and with my Samsung points. But I will say that the echo beats it because it can connect the speakers with Bluetooth and you don't have to buy another device to do it. Google you win on some things but you really need to fix this not cool

3.0,3 weeks ago,Currys,Jordan's review of Google Home Mini,"Pros: to start off getting smart devices in your home on a budget this is perfect, loud enough speaker for a large room a few games for kids and more often that not it does understand what you say boy coulours i bought look good personally prefer the black one to the gray one Cons: the AI isn't very I, you have to say commands and veneration of said command wont work, if your play music over 60% vol it will not hear you you have to shout at it from about a meter away,"

4.0,a year ago,ebay.com,Tv and audio description.,"Gives some interference on TV and audio description keeps kicking in unbidden. Like using as timer, dictionary, encyclopedia, to play akinator, as a calculator, listening to music on Spotify and more. Good buy, setting alarms is useful too."
5.0,a month ago,Best Buy,Fun but scary,Easy install and setup. Sound not as good as the Echo Dot 2 but you can make an outgoing to call to you Google contacts and show your mobile number on their caller ID. Keep in mind that they are always listening.

5.0,5 months ago,Best Buy,Bought it as a gift for my wife,Got this on sale during Thanksgiving week and my wife loves it. She can play all her music while she's doing her own thing. The volume is pretty loud as well for such a small device.
4.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Ok for the price.,I don’t have much to say about this item as I really haven’t used it. I don’t have smart lights and switches so really the only thing I have used this for is with my nest video door and rarely even do that. It looks nice and feels well made Howe it’s not much use for me. So I can’t recommend it to someone else.
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great buy for the price .,I purchased this google home mini to control my hue and nest and wemo smart plug. I decided to go with the mini because I do not need speakers for music. The mini is small enough to hide behind a vase or something and loud enough where if you did want to listen to music it would serve he purpose. I definitely recommend this if your looking for something to control the household for cheap and have the ability to connect many other things.
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great little device,"Couldn't pass up the deal of $29 plus $10 gift card! Already have an Amazon echo so I wanted to compare. Unfortunately there are a couple of my smart home devices that are not compatible, but overall I like the device. Sound quality is surprisingly better than expected for the size! Love the integration with my other android devices, including smart TV."
3.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Just average,"I bought this because Best Buy gave away a $10 GC with purchase. I have had Alexa products but Amazon has limited the music you can listen to on their devices with Prime. So, Google lets you listen to all your music with Google Play. Worth the purchase if you are invested in the Google ecosystem. However, I recommend buying the Google Home if you can catch it on sale. Same features but better speakers."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great addition for a smart home.,"Love these! Got it on sale. Very responsive and helpful to have around the house. One of the smart bulbs that I got from C by Ge stopped working with my Google Home, but I just control it from the C by GE app."

I also have 2 google homes which were more expensive and not worth the extra £ Cons: When the WiFi plays up you can’t use them and have to reconnect them again. Also google play music which you have to have to listen to music is £10 a month so not great as on going cost and even worse if you have kids that want there own google play music account can become quit expensive"

5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,First attempt in smart speaker,"Have used Bluetooth Speakers for a couple of years, but this is my first attempt for Smart Speaker. I got this mini with my pixel 2 pre-order and as a Chromecast user and Youtube TV subscriber. The continuity between these devices is really fluent. For the speaker point of view, it is decent for its size. And I'm happy with its audio quality for casual podcast and music listening."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Useful and fun little tool,The google home mini has been a fun and helpful addition to our home.

5.0,3 months ago,lowes.com,Google Smart Light Starter Kit,"If you looking for a small unit this is the one, it has a great sound for its size. We like it but wish it had a memory chip in it so you would not have to retrain it to recognize your voice. I think Google has missed this problem."

Smart lighting and devices pair up easily in conjunction and overall just help make life a little easier. Ask it anything really, itll get smarter over time."
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Integrates very well with Chromecast,I bought this Google Home Mini to replace my Amazon Echo Dot. The main reason for doing this was the Chromecast integration. I am able to request songs (Spotify) and videos (youTube) on the mini and have them play through a Chromecast device that is connected to my whole house receiver (please note as of this review there is no support for Netflix in this manner). Google still has some catching up to do to get to the functionality of the Echo Dot but they are adding functionality quite often.
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Nice sound in a small package,This google home was purchased for my daughter. She loves the device and mainly uses it for music. Device works very well with her Spotify Premium account. Sound washes out a little at 100% volume but not to bad where it sounds terrible

2.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Over rated,The light attached to the Google home mini worked for about 2 weeks and it has stopped working. The Google app can’t find it. It’s been factory reset several times as well as the Google home mini. I’m hesitant to use anymore. Too expensive not to work properly!
2.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Good But A Work In Progress...,"I purchased this to compare with the Amazon dot. I really don't like the placement of the lights as it makes them hard to see as opposed to the very visible ring on the dot. The sound is better in the home mini but the dot connects via bluetooth to any speaker and it has a audio jack to physically plug in a speaker if you want. The actual assistant I found easier to use with the dot so I prefer the dot over the home mini. I also hated having to say ""hey google"" or ""ok google"" as the wake up phrase!"
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,This thing is sweet!,I bought it because they dropped the price. I didn't think it would be worth it. I bought a 2nd one the same day to give to my brother as a gift. I particularly like asking to play what's in the news. I have it set up to give me top stories from 5 different sources. In 10 minutes I get a good idea of what's going on. And pairing it with my spotify premium account is awesome. It will play litterally any song i can think of.

Not only that but it makes a decent speaker for music, can be an alarm, timer, an works great for tracking sports. I think what sets this apart from Alexa is Google seems to handle natural language commands a lot better, you don't have to be super specific and that's really nice. It also supports multiple users just by using your voice, just talk to it and it gets your stuff, not anyone else."

If the purchasers desire entertainment and find solutions to questions, the Mini is a bargain."
4.0,2 years ago,Currys,James's review of Google Home Mini,Pros: Well designed and appears of a good quality. Cons: Disappointing that you have to be VERY specific in all interactions with the device and it's limitations are evident early on. Attempting to stream music to devices in different rooms simultaneously is infuriating as there is always a lag between the devices creating a horrible echo like effect. I've never owned an Echo however relatives do and I find myself pondering my decision to buy Google.
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Good Home Assistant,"Google home mini works great with Insteon automation. Much better than Alexa. I have both and the positive with Google Home is it’s ability to turn on and off multiple lights and control more than one automated systems. Alexa is not able to run scenes, Google can. Alexa was a little better at controlling the Harmony Hub, but I typically use a remote anyway."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Better than the Echo Dot,"The speaker quality is pretty amazing. It's not great, but was surprising considering I was thinking it would be the quality of the Echo Dot. It's clear when it's loud and has a good bass in the Google Assistant's voice. The Google mini is perfect for just placing around the house where you need it. I love using it to be extra lazy in turning multiple devices on in the room."

5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Move over Alexa,"When I was looking to buy something like this last year, Alexa was the clear winner. However, I came to find out that Alexa was somewhat restrictive in its use. I saw the Home Mini advertised on TV and was very impressed by what it could do- so I ordered one. Believe me , it did not disappoint. I bought it primarily for use in my 13 yearold son's room. The feature I like best is ttthat it responds to my voice, as well which makes things easier to access when he falls asleep."

5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Google Mini is my new Friend :),I bought three of these over the Thanksgiving weekend and there no problem setting them up. I bought them to use with my Phillips Hue system and pairing was seamless there too. The speaker isn't the greatest but good enough for occasionally listening to music. However the microphone works really well and can pick up my voice from ~20 feet away. Overall I'm happy with it and would definitely recommend.

I was so wrong after seeing the capability of the devices. Given that I already had several smart home devices in the house, this was the piece that connected it all together. I can continue working on what I am doing without having to pick up my phone. Additionally, it syncs with my phone. Perfect!"

It’s similar to Alexa, I do love it to play music or wake me up (alarm). The only only thing is when I request some songs to be played it can’t play it or says I needed to subscribe to google play music when I am subscribed. Sometimes it doesn’t understand my boyfriends voice. It does seem more limited than the Alexa, but I still love it."

You link it up to your phone (I'm not sure if this is Android only) and then you can ask it the same kind of questions you can ask the Google Assistant on your phone. ""What's the weather like tomorrow?"" or ""What's my day look like today?"". I have one of these and have some smart plugs so I can say things like ""Turn on the Christmas tree"" and magic happens!"

It does well with recognizing all the commands it is given. I love the fact it can distinguish between everyone in the house. You have to get one for yourself to understand how great it is. Especially for the price. Google has a lot of support for smart devices so get it while you can!
4.0,2 years ago,Currys,Andrew's review of Google Home Mini,Pros: Music streaming is great but requires a subscription to one of the music services to benefit fully. Shopping list invaluable.

Sometimes won't detect voice especially if playing music.

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Solid Assistant for Small Room,"I replaced an Echo Dot with this Google Home Mini and I'm very satisfied. The Google Assistant experience feels more intuitive to me and my family. The speaker sound is much richer than the Dot however, it is not meant to be used to play music for a party or at a loud volume. If placed in a corner in a small room the sound is surprisingly good for such a small unit. If you're invested in the Google ecosystem, this is a no brainer purchase."

The compact and sleek design allow it to easily blend far better than its older brother. I currently now have 2 of them paired with the rest of my Google Cast devices including the Google Home, which has seamlessly integrated and made my home smarter. If you are on the fence regarding assistance, Google is the standard and the price for entry is now more affordable. Once you get one, its hard not to add more to do more!!!"

5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Much better than Echo,"Google Home is much better than Echo / Alexa. I have 2 Google Home units, a Mini and a standard one as well as an Echo Dot. Echo / Alexa is fine for controlling lights and shopping but Google Home is able to actually answer your questions, Echo / Alexa is dumb in comparison. An added plus is that the Google Mini sounds better than the comparable Echo Dot when playing music."
1.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Disappointed,This was a disappointment compared to the Echo Dot. Comparatively speaking the Echo Dot is the hands down winner. Unless you link the mini with Google Home and any other account or service it doesn't perform. The tap controls are not very good and the absence of a 3.5 mm jack to hook up external speakers was a huge mistake. Love Google but this was a dud. It was returned the day after purchase.

4.0,11 months ago,Best Buy,Pretty cool!,The Google Home Mini is pretty cool! The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the speaker obnoxiously reminds you (without warning) when it hasn't been set up. This made for quite a few scares :(

The only thing is, Google home works with limited number of music accounts, and sometimes for some questions it just says ""I don't know"", instead of virtual assistants on cell phones, which would give a list from web searching results.

4.0,6 months ago,ebay.com,Fun but not perfect,It is handy for reminding me of appointments and playing the radio. Downside is the smart plugs keep dropping and have to be linked again which a pain as I can't use it as I would like. Jokes could be better too.
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great Device and the Kids Love it,I purchased this item to help control some of my smart devices. This makes life so much easier to control these items. Instead of opening all the different control apps I can simply ask google to do so. It took sometime to understand how to setup everything but once I figured this out it’s very easy to control. The only thing I don’t understand is that it randomly beeps with out us asking it anything.

5.0,2 years ago,John Lewis,Fantastic gadget,"Bought the google mini for my husband’s birthday. Didn’t really know what I was purchasing but knew he would like it as he likes gadgets. Well, my husband was chuffed to bits with it and not only does he use it, we all use it in the houses. Speaker is great for music which surprised us as it is so small. We have also hooked it up to our Nest Home and to a few of our lights. I would definitely recommend purchasing the google mini."
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Needs better answers to questions,"Love the control of audiocast devices and chromecast devices. However it is not as good at random questions as I thought a Google device would be. Alexa is better. Once you can ask it questions about random facts and history, etc, it'll be much better."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Great product given the cost,"Sound quality is good, obviously not as good as its big brother. I think mic on this one is better than its big brother. I have both in two different rooms. I some time have to yell at the big one, while I am fairly comfortable with this small one"
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Sounds Great for the Size.,"Better Late than Never. Google came into the game late in reference to Alexa, But the Design and responses are more humanized than Alexa for everyday use. Unless you have all different brands of home automation under the planet it works well for most known brands of Smart Home devices. If it primarily for placing online orders, then it is not the device for you. #GoogleAssistant please make it one word, drop Hey / OK."
5.0,5 months ago,ebay.com,"excellent product, must be magic involved","wanted to try the voice activated smart device, well worth the $22 to get involved. my favorite is at night going to sleep, pick a station, tell it to stop in 30 minutes, works like magic"
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Works with some irks,It cancels out excelently in my short time with the product so far. My big issue is the buttons which don't have any tactile feel for normal use. I also seem to have the issue that they play pause buttons require an unlocked phone and won't function till I get to my home page (current up to date samsung s8). My only other qualm with this headset is that for the origional device price that it didn't come with retractable cables.

I'm still exploring its other qualities but so far I am very happy with it."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Smart Speaker with Plenty of Brains,"This speaker is great. The price point is a bargain. The sound is small, but robust for the form factor.

Good starting point for anyone looking to dip their toes into the smart speaker pool."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Crazy Cool,"The google home mini is definitely one of the greatest value's to find this holiday season. Product works like a charm and it is incredible to turn on lights and turning on tv shows on my TV just by asking the device to do so. (You must have a smart plug for the lights, and a chromecast for the tv shows, but they are very affordable as well.) Price was phenominal at $29.99, but even at $49.99 this is definitely a bargain as well."
3.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Smarter Than Siri,This is loud for a small speaker. The sound quality is not that bad. Fun to play games. I wish it could play audio to other speakers via bluetooth. Voice is much louder than audio playing at same volume.
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Very useful for the entire family,"This thing is awesome. It can be set to recognize more than one voice so that it can tell you what's on your schedule or make calls from your phonebook. The kids use it to help them do their homework, with things like spelling. I haven't yet but it can control the thermostat and other things that are compatible with it. We keep it in the kitchen so on school days we ask ask it for the weather to help decide what the kids are going to wear."

5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Our home's informational butler,"Love this product!!! It understands my voice and my wife's. We have access to google at our command, AND we can ask the status of which of our smart connected devices are on or off. Coupled with the fact that we can access our Google Music which has our cds uploaded to the cloud, we also have access to our podcasts. We love it and we are using it more than a competitve product. Highly recommend Google Home for your home!!"
5.0,9 months ago,Best Buy,Perfect for controlling smart devices,"I added this and some wifi smart plugs to my bedroom to easily control the lamps, and it's a game-changer. The fact that it can play music and answer simple questions (weather, etc) is a bonus."

Just do some research on google home/smart home ."
4.0,2 years ago,Currys,Michael's review of Google Home Mini,"Pros: Having music playing in the home at listenable quality is amazing. CDs are a thing of the past now and the quality of listening through a low volume phone speaker has always been awful without headphones. I'm able to enjoy music with my family and fill my home with sound. Cons: The inability to make calls to friends and businesses. It's possible to do in the USA but not the UK, yet!"
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Speaker is 3x better than echo dot,"I have this and echo dots. The speaker is far superior, as is the question and answer to it. Alexa is better for home automation and for the built in skills, but Google will get there soon enough. I have purchased and given away many of these as gifts."

5.0,a year ago,Target,most bang for your buck,Great personal assistant. I use it mostly for playing music throughout the house since you can link them together if you have multiple. speaker quality is great. Also great for asking those random questions you have throughout the day
3.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,OK Smart Speaker to start with,"First impression for the product was overwhelming but as I started using it, it kind of acted stupid. It cannot open youtube videos unless we have a chromecast or chromecast enabled tv which is a huge downside. The reminder also doesn't says clearly what it is for unless you ask on your own. I would think in a year or two AI would make a progress and the product would be better than now but anyways for under 50$ its a good deal anyway."

I know I am a lazy person, and with the connectivity to philips hue, I am able to control the intensity and the color of the lights by just my speech. In addition, every morning once I wake up, I get to hear the news, weather and a fun fact. this might be a mini, but has a plethora of functionalities that I am still exploring everyday."

It seemed like i could do all the same things with my mobile device, but this has bought it all together while in home. The speaker to play music is perfect for the size. If you want music that shakes your house, this isn't for you. If you want an easy device that can fill a room with nice sound, then this is just right."
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Good start,"This is the first google assistant device that I have bought and it's a good place to start, both in terms of the device at where the performance is at. The device is a good first piece to seeing how you would use an assistant and figuring out what you want/need more of where ( a barebones version for when you walk in the door, compared to a massive speaker built in for better sound quality in the living room). Also as far as the performance is concerned, I think they are on the right track, but there is always room for growth especially in such a new field."

5.0,2 years ago,ebay.com,I prefer the Google Home Mini to Amazon mini,"I have both Google Home Mini and Amazon mini. Although both have merits, I like the Google one better due to easier configuration and better localization. As I live out of the official service country, I had to go the extra mile configuring them. My complaint with Amazon Mini was that I was not able to download an app via Google Play Store. On the other hand, the Google Mini was far easier to setup."

The original Home still works better in large, busy environments."
5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Home Mini for everyone,"All 3 of my children received a Mini for christmas. We even got one for the master bedroom too. We already had Google Home and now have 4 minis.

4.0,8 months ago,Best Buy,Good but not what I was expecting,"Not a whole lot of difference from the echo but not really what I expected specially from Google. Sometimes it takes a couple of times for this thing to do what say to it, when Alexa can do it at the first time."

Asking all sorts of questions and receiving the answers for the most part. He has linked his phone to it but not anything else as of yet. He would always tell everyone to ‘google ot’ When they asked a question so this is the perfect gift! We are having a lot of fun with it’s and learning too!

4.0,2 years ago,Currys,Graham's review of Google Home Mini,Pros: Simple to setup and use on its own and with other devices or ITTT actions. Good sound from it’s top mounted speaker. Responds well to voice commands and searches for music and media. Cons: It’s still a developing device so there are limitations to the available commands and actions but Google are adding more over time.
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Very similar to Echo Dot,"Like the Amazon Echo Dot, this is Google's home assistant and it is very similar. Google's voice recognition is more advanced than Amazons, however since Amazon has been around much longer the Google device is behind as far as connecting to home control devices and the one big problem I have with it is that it will NOT connect to bluetooth speakers and such. I do like the ability to use Google's casting function from your Chrome browser."
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Solid companion to the full-sized home,"I bought the original Google Home on Black Friday last year. It has been a solid companion. We wanted to move the Google Home into the kitchen, so we we decided to get a Mini for the bedroom. It works just as well as the Home, with a lower-quality (as expected) speaker. There are some Google Assistant features that would make it even more useful, so I'm giving 4/5 for now."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Better than Alexa,I like the answers/responses from my Google mini over Amazon Alexa. I guess that is to be expected given that Amazon is nowhere near as robust with its search results as Google. Both serve distinctive purposes. I primarily use Alexa to keep track of my Amazon orders.

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,Google Mini,We have a Google Home and enjoy it. I ask Google questions while helping my grandson with his homework.

5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,What an awesome gadget,Siri on the iPhone wasn’t very responsive when instructing our connected home. We researched other options and the Google home mini for $50 was an excellent choice. We look forward to adding more of these guys to our home. Definitely recommend.

Was very easy to set up and is extremely easy to use."
4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Good For the Price,"I have a full Google Home and now a few of the minis. If you are familiar with Google Home - it's a small version of that. Very small - smaller than expected! And that's probably good in terms of taking up space, and the sound is good for the size. The one HUGE flaw with the Google Home products is that you cannot fully link to your Google account if you have a Google G Suite account. Which is absolutely ridiculous."
5.0,a year ago,walmart.com,Easy Smart Home,The included bulb was the easiest dmart home device so far. The bulb and mini both work very well. This GE product is the first to work with Google Assistant right out of the box. They do still require a hub to work with Alexa.

5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great inexpensive assistant,"The Google home mini is a great inexpensive assistant. The sound quality is better compared to Echo Dot and it is more likely to get a question right when asked a question than Alexa is. As of the writing of this review, Feb 2018, Alexa seems to be a more complete assistant in terms of skills that she can do so I would recommend Google Home Mini if you are going to use it stand alone but the Echo Dot if you want integration with other things."

However this is not without a cost, the sound from them is good, but as one would expect from looking, there is no bass. It's good in our Kitchen and Bedroom, but the Living room has a full Google Home, which has much better sound."

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,This donut sized speaker is awesome!,Love this little thing. Its sleek design and its portability is a great selling point. I gave it 4 stars because the actual assistant is still a work in progress. This also isn't as loud as the Google Home (obviously). At most it might sound as loud as the highest speaker volume on your smartphone. (maybe slightly louder).
5.0,a year ago,Target,Small but powerful,Great little speaker that asks like the larger Google Home. I’m using it as an alarm and for checking my devices. Plays music through Google Music or other services. Also controlling several devices.

Seems to do better on local businesses, movies, hours of operations, etc. Alexa seems to drag on about thing sometimes. Google Home seems more to the point. Still trying it out. I think I can hook it up to MYq garage opener. Cheaper than buying the MYq bridge."

I have now installed 3 of these and they work great.

If you ask it to play a specific song it'll probably only be available if you subscribe for $9.99 a month which seems extreme. If you ask for an artist it will give you a ""mix"" which might be that artist or maybe another similar artist. Most questions it will tell you ""I can't help with that"". This is still in the toy stage."
5.0,a year ago,Best Buy,We love this!,This is great for having in our bedroom. We ask for the weather and any calendar events we have for the day while getting ready for work. It also works great with our August home lock. And we use it for night sounds to go sleep. Definitely a great buy!

Answers most of your questions and will, plays music and sets reminders although I thought it’d actually set the alarm off when you’re scheduled to do something, instead you’ve got to ask it what you’ve got to do for the day. Still good though, I don’t suppose anyone would expect this gadget to do much more Cons: Gets stuck when playing music on Spotify I have to stop the song playing from my phone if want to change artist."

4.0,2 years ago,bestbuy.ca,I liked it,A review about the price is not a review about the product as I love my little Mini as now I can turn on my Hue Lighting with my voice or ask it how cold it is outside before I go out. It even tells you a joke if you asked it and the local news and sports. However if you want to use it to control Netflix you will need a Chromcast as I went and bought the Ultra version but did not work well with my 4K TV as was not getting 5.1 Audio. But this is not a problem with this device it's the Chromcast issues as I will stick with the APP that is on my TV for Netflix

That means most of the time when Alexa can’t answer your question, Google home can. I am very happy with my purchase over all."
4.0,2 years ago,Currys,J's review of Google Home Mini,"Pros: Better sound quality than the Echo Dot, cheaper too. Seems much quicker to respond and more reliable at recognition compared to the Dot.

Don't generally like cloth on my tech gadgets at it collects dust/dirt and is hard to clean/stains."

5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Best little A.I.,"I have both the Google Home Mini and the Amazon Echo Dot in my home. I must say that the GH Mini AI is a little more advanced that the Echo Dot. Don't get me wrong, the Echo Dot is a good item and is great for shopping on Amazon Prime. The GH Mini is just better at understanding what you are saying or trying to say. It is also better at providing information on what you are actually asking for. Try it out and if you dont like it take it back before your 14 day return period ends."

I have found out that Microsoft have been working on the problem hopefully they find a solution to run android apps on windows system.

5.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Great for the price and overall everything,The Google home mini is excellent in controlling your smart home and answering questions. It can pretty much do whatever you ask it to do. The only cons I have is that it doesn't always hear me at times or when it does it responds that it can not perform the action yet even though it has before. Can't answer everything but mostly basic everyday questions work fine.

1.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Not everything I hoped it would be,"The only reason I gave the Google Mini one star is because I couldn't get it to pair up with my Vivant system or Hue lights. It's also lacking some of the knowledge and responsiveness that you'll find with an Amazon Echo. Maybe I didn't give it enough of a chance in some respects, however, I really wanted something easy to use that pairs with my smart home and I didn't get that with the Google Mini. Having said that, what didn't work for me, doesn't necessarily mean that it won't work for others"

4.0,2 years ago,Best Buy,Nice.. but....,I love Google home and have several in my house... when this came out I was excited and picked one up.... it does every thing the larger Google home does but it is smaller.... and that's where the issue lies for me at least. Because it's smaller the speaker is smaller and just doesn't have the bass or clarity of the larger one. So if you use your google home for music you're better off paying $50 more and getting the larger one.... if music is no issue to you this does exactly what the large one does.
